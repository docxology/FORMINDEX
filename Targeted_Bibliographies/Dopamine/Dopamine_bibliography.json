Analysis of gene expression data from brains revealed that only a small number of unique differentially expressed genes are responsible for scouting & tandem\u0010running.  Comparison of orthologous genes between T. americanus & T. longispinosus suggests that tandem\u0010running is characterized by species\u0010specific patterns of gene usage.  However, within both species, tandem\u0010leaders showed gene expression patterns median to those of scouts & tandem\u0010followers, which was expected, as leaders can be recruited from either of the other 2 behavioral states.  Most importantly, a number of differentially expressed behavioral genes were found, with functions relating to learning & memory formation in other social & nonsocial insects.  This includes a number of up\u0010regulated receptor genes such as a glutamate & dopamine receptor, as well as serine/threonine\u0010protein phosphatases & kinases.  Learning & memory genes were specifically up\u0010regulated within scouts & tandem\u0010followers, not only reinforcing previous behavioral studies into how Temnothorax navigate novel environments & share information, but also providing insight into the molecular underpinnings of teaching & learning within social insects.]",

Tactile stimulation to the abdomen elicited quick forward movements in a dart escape in 90% of the ants in a colony.  Less than 10% of the ants responded with a quick defensive turn towards the source of stimulation.  To reveal the neuronal mechanisms underlying this defensive behavior, the effect of brain biogenic amines on the responses to tactile stimuli were investigated.  The levels of octopamine, dopamine, & serotonin in the brain were significantly elevated in ants that responded with a defensive turn to the unexpected stimulus compared with ants that responded with a dart escape.  Oral administration of dopamine & serotonin demonstrated that both amines contributed to the initiation of a defensive response.  Oral administration of l-DOPA weakly affected the initiation of the defensive turn, while 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan strongly affected the initiation of defensive behavior.  Oral administration of ketanserin, a serotonin antagonist, inhibited the initiation of the defensive turn in aggressive workers, eliminating the effects of both serotonin & 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan on the initiation of turn responses.]",

    "abstract": "Eusociality represents the higher degree of interaction in insects. This complex social structure is maintained through a multimodal communication system that allows colony members to be flexible in their responses, fulfilling the overall society's needs. The colony plasticity is supposedly achieved by combining multiple biochemical pathways through the neuromodulation of molecules such as biogenic amines, but the mechanisms through which these regulatory compounds act are far from being fully disentangled. Here, we review the potential function of major bioamines (dopamine, tyramine, serotine, and octopamine) on the behavioral modulation of principal groups of eusocial Hymenoptera, with a special focus on ants. Because functional roles are species- and context-dependent, identifying a direct causal relationship between a biogenic amine variation and behavioral changes is extremely challenging. We also used a quantitative and qualitative synthesis approach to summarize research trends and interests in the literature related to biogenic amines of social insects. Shedding light on the aminergic regulation of behavioral responses will pave the way for an entirely new approach to understanding the evolution of sociality in insects.          *[Harpegnathos saltator misspelled Herpegnathos saltator.]",

In an attempt to identify other neural signals that trigger the reproductive system, we measured the effect on brain biogenic amines of separation from the queen. Dopamine in the brain of virgin females increased from 552 +/- 42 to 971 +/- 65 fMol/brain when reproduction and dealation were stimulated by 15 days of separation. Octopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine did not change significantly after the separation. Isolated virgin females fed with a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor 3-iodo-L-tyrosine mixed in sucrose for 15 days laid significantly fewer eggs and had fewer chorionated oocytes in their ovarioles than females fed with sucrose only. Restoring dopamine biosynthesis by adding L-dopa to the food also restored oogenesis and oviposition. Dealation was not affected by 3-iodo-L-tyrosine or L-dopa. The possible role of dopamine as the neural target of the queen pheromone regarding its potent allotoregulatory effect in other insects is discussed.",

In this study, we explored the role of mvA in the division of labour by worker ants (Solenopsis invicta). We first determined the presence of mvA in RNAs from the brains of worker ants and found that mvA methylation dynamics differed between foragers and nurses. Depletion of mvA methyltransferase or chemical suppression of mvA methylation in foragers resulted in a shift to 'nurse\u0010like' behaviours. Specifically, mRNAs of dopamine receptor 1 (Dop1) and dopamine transporter (DAT) were modified by mvA, and their expression increased dopamine levels to promote the behavioural transition from foragers to nurses. The abundance of Dop1 and DAT mRNAs and their stability were reduced by the inhibition of mvA modification caused by the silencing of Mettl3, suggesting that mvA modification in worker ants modulates dopamine synthesis, which regulates labour division. Collectively, our results provide the first example of the epitranscriptomic regulation of labour division in social insects and implicate mvA regulatory mechanism as a potential novel target for controlling red imported fire ants.",

The present study investigates the neurochemistry of the queenless ant species, Streblognathus peetersi, to better understand the neural basis of the high behavioural plasticity observed in queenless ants. We report measurements of brain biogenic amines [octopamine, dopamine, serotonin] of S. peetersi ants; they reveal a new set of biogenic amine influences on social organisation with no common features with other 'primitively organised societies' (bumble bees) and some common features with 'highly eusocial' species (honey bees). This similarity to honey bees may either confirm the heritage of queenless species from their probably highly eusocial ancestors or highlight independent patterns of biogenic amine influences on the social organisation of these highly derived species.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the regulation of fluid secretion by the Malpighian tubules of the worker ant Formica polyctena (Hymenoptera). Different solvent systems were used to make crude head extracts and to determine the solubility of the diuretic factors. Surprisingly, when distilled water, acid acetone, methanol and 15% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were used as solvents, two consecutive significant stimulations of fluid secretion were obtained: the first, when adding the extract to the tubule and the second, when washing it out. Extract obtained with a fifth solvent, Ringer solution, gave an almost complete but reversible inhibition of fluid secretion. Extracts were prepurified by means of a disposable C18 column by elution with 20, 40, 60 and 80% acetonitrile. When the fractions were kept apart the 40% acetonitrile fraction caused an inhibition of fluid secretion. The 20, 60 and 80% acetonitrile fractions on the other hand resulted in two consecutive stimulations as described above. The dose-response curve for 15% TFA extract was bell-shaped with a threshold concentration of 1 X l0-3 heads/microliter Ringer. A maximum response (stimulation of fluid secretion by a factor of 3.3 + 0.72, n = 10) was observed with a concentration of 5 X 10-2 heads/microliter Ringer. Higher concentrations resulted in small increases of fluid secretion rates and in the appearance of the second stimulation when the extract was washed out. The activity present in the beads of Formica was not destroyed by boiling or by proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase E and proteinase K). Only immobilized aminopeptidase M, which destroys the activity of peptides with a free N-terminus, had a significant. effect on the activity of a 15% TFA head extract. Various biogenic amines were tested for their ability to mimic the effect of the head extracts. Only octopamine and dopamine evoked a small and transient increase in secretion rate. Thus biogenic amines probably do not contribute to a large extent to the response of Formica tubules to the crude head extract. The possibility that both diuretic and antidiuretic factors are present in the extract is discussed.",

I critically analyzed programmed senescence in respect to the sociobiology of worker longevity & evaluated how large colony size achieved through selection for extended worker lifespan enhances colony fitness. My study found no support for worker programmed senescence.  Using robust behavioral assays, I found aging was not correlated with declines in sensory responsiveness or motor functions associated with foraging, nursing, & prey-capture tasks, or activity level & phototaxis.  Old minor workers (95 days) followed pheromone trails for greater distances than 20-day old minors & showed higher activity levels, suggesting improvement in behavioral performance.  Neural substrates likely underscoring task performance were maintained with age: synaptic complex density was constant & apoptosis was unchanged with age.  Sensory & motor control brain regions did not show age-related increases in neurodegeneration.  Worker spatial location predicted social role independent of age: foragers exhibited higher activity levels & more aggressive predatory behavior than nurses.  Serotonin & dopamine titers increased from 20 to 120 days, but showed no clear correlation with social role.  Pharmacological manipulations of brain serotonin had no effect on brood care, predatory response, activity, or phototaxis.  Finally, I assessed arborization of a serotonergic neuron hypothesized to underscore task performance to determine how aging across subcastes influences neuronal structure.

    "abstract": "Social insect workers modify task performance according to age-related schedules of behavioral development, and/or changing colony labor requirements based on flexible responses that may be independent of age. Using known-age minor workers of the ant Pheidole dentata throughout 68 % of their 140-day laboratory lifespan, we asked whether workers found inside or outside the nest differed in task performance and if behaviors were correlated with and/or causally linked to changes in brain serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA). Our results suggest that task performance patterns of individually assayed minors collected at these two spatially different worksites were independent of age. Outside-nest minors displayed significantly higher levels of predatory behavior and greater activity than inside-nest minors, but these groups did not differ in brood care or phototaxis. We examined the relationship of 5HT and DA to these behaviors in known-age minors by quantifying individual brain titers. Both monoamines did not increase significantly from 20 to 95 days of age. DA did not appear to directly regulate worksite location, although titers were significantly higher in outside-nest than inside-nest workers. Pharmacological depletion of 5HT did not affect nursing, predation, phototaxis, or activity. Our results suggest that worker task capabilities are independent of age beyond 20 days, and only predatory behavior can be consistently predicted by spatial location. This could reflect worker flexibility or variability in the behavior of individuals collected at each location, which could be influenced by complex interactions between age, worksite location, social interactions, neuromodulators, and other environmental and internal regulators of behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Physiological changes associated with worker age are considered to be important regulators of task performance in social insects. The extent to which worker age is correlated with behavior, and the degree to which developmental changes in neuromodulators control worker labor, however, are poorly understood. We found that ant workers are behaviorally flexible in respect to task performance at a given age, but differ in predatory response and activity level based on their worksite location (within or outside of the nest). Dopamine level was higher in outside-nest workers; serotonin did not appear to be causally linked to any behavior we examined. Our findings suggest that worker task performance can be independent of age, and workers maintain task efficacy throughout their lifespan while differing in some aspects of behavioral performance that may change with worksite location. Relationships between age, worksite, and neuromodulator titers appear to be complex.",

Reward secretions from the dorsal nectary organ (DNO) of Narathura japonica caterpillars function to reduce the locomotory activities of their attendant ants, Pristomyrmex punctatus workers.  Workers that feed from caterpillar secretions are significantly more likely to show aggressive responses to eversion of the tentacle organs of the caterpillars.  Analysis of the neurogenic amines in the brains of workers that consumed caterpillar secretions showed a significant decrease in levels of dopamine compared with controls.  Experimental treatments in which reserpine, a known inhibitor of dopamine in Drosophila, was fed to workers similarly reduced their locomotory activity.  We conclude that DNO secretions of lycaenid caterpillars can manipulate attendant ant behavior by altering dopaminergic regulation & increasing partner fidelity.  Unless manipulated ants also receive a net nutritional benefit from DNO secretions, this suggests that similar reward-for-defense interactions that have been traditionally considered to be mutualisms may in fact be parasitic in nature.]",

    "abstract": "Many studies suggest a role for biogenic amines in a variety of insect behaviors including intraspecific aggression. In ants, despite a rich behavioral repertoire and prominent aggressive interactions, little is known about the potential impact of biogenic amines.  This may partly be due to the general lack of information about aminergic systems in the ant brain.    The present study investigates serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems in the brain of the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator. In H. saltator, intraspecific aggression is important for the regulation of reproduction. This species, therefore, is amenable to comparative studies of aminergic neuronal effects on long-term changes in aggression. Using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that in the brains of sterile workers, the distributions of serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal processes differed substantially. In addition, branching patterns of serotonergic neurons showed marked differences between males and females. Brains of workers after 3 days and 3 weeks of aggressive interactions revealed no marked differences in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons compared to those of reproductive and non-aggressive individuals. We conclude that different levels of intraspecific aggression do not involve profound anatomical changes in serotonergic and  dopaminergic neurons. Subtle changes may be masked by inter-individual variances.          *[Harpegnathos saltator colonies were initially excavated at Jog Falls, Karnataka State, Southern India in 1994, 1995, & 1999.

During such a test, a dyad of nestmates was placed together in a set of 2 connected test tubes.  Behavior of the tested ants was influenced significantly both by the duration of the social isolation period and by pharmacological treatment.  Longer duration of the social isolation period (20 days) had a stimulating effect on trophallaxis, but a suppressing effect on self-grooming, biting/tearing of the moist cotton plug, resting accompanied by head &/or antennae movements, & total immobility.  Octopamine (but not tyramine) influenced significantly all forms of social interactions observed during the tests, exerting a suppressing effect on trophallaxis & on antennal contacts with the nestmate, & stimulating the frequency of allogrooming.  Both octopamine & its metabolic precursor tyramine stimulated self-grooming behavior & resting behavior accompanied by head &/or antennae movements, but reduced biting/tearing of the moist cotton plug, & antennal exploration of the junction between the 2 test tubes.  The effects of tyramine & octopamine were never antagonistic.  Tyramine (but not octopamine) stimulated jerking behavior & licking of the inner surface of the test tube.  Dopamine had no significant effect on behavior displayed by the ants during the nestmate reunion tests.  Aggression/dominance behavior was never observed during the whole experiment.

The variation in the locomotor ability of 3 ant species (Formica cinerea, Myrmica scabrinodis, & Tetramorium caespitum) was studied after treatment with the 2 major O. vulgare terpenoid volatile compounds (i.e., carvacrol & thymol). The brain levels of 3 biogenic amines (dopamine, tyramine, serotonin) were analyzed in ants exposed to the O. vulgare terpenoids by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS.  Carvacrol & thymol increased the locomotor activity of all ant species tested, but if blended reduced the movement propensity of Myrmica scabrinodis.  Dopamine & tyramine production was positively correlated with the worker locomotor activity.  In Myrmica ants, both brain biogenic ammines were negatively correlated with the aggressive behavior.  Blends of O. vulgare volatiles affected the locomotor ability, while increased the aggressiveness of Myrmica workers by altering the aminergic regulation in the ant brains.]",

As adult minor workers of the ant Pheidole dentata age, they attend to brood more frequently and nurse more efficiently, perform a broader array of tasks, and undergo myological and neural development. Because these factors covary, the causal relationships among age, task experience, and neural and physiological maturation are not understood. We compared brood-care performance and efficiency by 10-day-old P. dentata minors that had acquired nursing experience to that of equal-age minors experimentally deprived of brood contact. We found the frequency and efficiency of nursing did not significantly differ between experimental and control worker groups, suggesting experience is not required for age-related improvement in nursing efficiency. Workers with and without prior nursing experience did not significantly differ macroscopically in brain anatomy or in brain serotonin content, although workers from the two treatments had slightly, but significantly, different levels of brain dopamine. These results suggest experience with brood is not required for P. dentata minor workers to develop nursing proficiency or undergo a substantial degree of the age-related neural development identifiable by our assessments, which could underscore the ontogeny of brood-care efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Temporal polyethism, or age-correlated task performance, is a near universal feature of labor organization in social insects. Typically, young workers engage in within-nest work (nursing immatures), while older workers perform outside-nest work (foraging). In the ant Pheidole dentata, the number of tasks workers perform, and their task competence, increases as they age. This behavioral maturation is accompanied by marked neurological changes, including synaptic pruning, proliferation of serotonergic neurons, and increased dopamine and serotonin titres in the brain. Here we present novel evidence that worker brood-rearing efficiency also increases with age and that older workers are efficient nurses. This result contrasts with the traditional view that young workers form a discrete age caste that specializes on nursing. We next describe an additional neural correlate of temporal polyethism in P. dentata: expansion of the mushroom bodies, paired neuropils involved in learning and sensory integration. Finally, we provide the first experimental demonstration causally linking increased serotonin titre to two distinct components of foraging behavior: outside nest activity and responsiveness to trail pheromone. Workers fed the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan had increased serotonin levels (verified by HPLC), were more likely to leave the nest, and followed trails longer than controls or workers whose serotonin levels were reduced by the serotonin synthesis blocker alpha-methyltryptophan. These results further our understanding of the social organization of labor by focusing on neural development and the aminergic control of polyethism in P. dentata.

Biogenic amines play a role in motivating the behavior as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neurohormones in the nervous systems. In ants, the change of brain amine levels is linked to various behavioral properties: reproduction, cooperation, and hostility. Aggressiveness is also manipulated by the neurological systems. The social structures in some ant species are established by aggressive interactions among queens. However, there are a few cases showing the putative role of biogenic amines for the queen aggression. Vollenhovia nipponica is a social parasite ant, which establishes functional monogyny that antagonistic interactions among multiple queens lead to dominance hierarchy. In this time, we examined changes in the levels of biogenic amines in heads of queens in V. nipponica, associated with the observation of aggressive behavior. In the colonies, dealate queens violently attacked toward each other by biting and pulling on body parts. Whereas, the aggressive behavior was never observed in alate queens. In the measurements in four biogenic amines, serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), octopamine (OA), and tyramine (TA), the levels of 5-HT and DA in dealates were significantly higher than those in alates. The levels of OA and TA were not significantly different between them. Moreover, the similar changes were confirmed in the groups of young (10-30 days old) and old queens (more than 6-month old). In V. nipponica queens, 5-HT and DA could regulate motivation of aggression, irrespective of age. However, the changes of biogenic amines are possibly affected by other behavioral factors.",

Workers could identify larval caste based on a chemical signal specific to queen-destined larvae, & the production of this signal was directly linked to increased juvenile hormone levels.  This association provides a connection between the physiological factors that induce queen development & the production of a caste-specific larval signal.  In addition to caste determination at the larval stage, adult workers of H. saltator compete to establish a reproductive hierarchy.  Unlike other social insects, dominance in H. saltator was not related to differences in juvenile hormone or ecdysteroid levels.

    "abstract": "Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in H. saltator as well as drive differences in worker task performance.

    "abstract": "How individual organisms whose behavior is potentially driven by selfish interests cooperate to form a society is a central question in evolutionary biology. Worker reproduction and its suppression in eusocial insects provide an illuminating model of such a conflict resolution. Although many theoretical and empirical studies focus on the nature and evolutionary consequences of this reproductive conflict, little is known about its physiological underpinnings. Here, we hypothesized that the dopaminergic system, which has a gonadotropic function in eusocial Hymenoptera, is controlled by social suppression via the queen presence signal and the worker-worker dominance interactions. In Diacamma sp. from Japan, the queen presence signal is transferred to workers by direct contact, and worker-worker dominance interaction occurs commonly in large colonies, even when a queen is present. Using the ant Diacamma sp., we showed that the aggressive interactions among workers suppressed brain dopamine levels of the workers. Moreover, our data suggest that the queen presence signal transmitted by direct contact suppresses the brain dopamine level and the transcription of dopamine synthetic enzyme (ddc) of workers. Our data provide clear empirical evidence that worker brain dopamine is suppressed by both social stimuli directed from dominant workers and the queen. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In eusocial Hymenoptera, worker reproduction is suppressed by social interactions such as queen presence information and dominance interaction. Dopamine, one of the biogenic amines, is a well-known gonadotropic neurohormone in eusocial Hymenoptera. Honeybee studies revealed that the queen presence information regulated dopamine levels in worker brains. In an ant, the dominance interaction also controlled dopamine levels of workers. In a queenless ant Diacamma sp., queen presence information and dominance interaction are known to dually suppress worker reproduction. Given the above examples, dopaminergic signaling is predicted to be a general mechanism that can suppress worker reproduction in multiple ways. We here test whether both the queen- and worker-originated signals (i.e., queen presence information and dominance interaction) affect the worker dopamine level. We show that dopaminergic signaling is affected by dual social factors, suggesting the general role of dopaminergic signaling in mediating social interaction and reproductive suppression.",

    "abstract": "Colonies of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, regulate foraging activity based on food availability and local conditions. Colony variation in foraging behavior is thought to be linked to biogenic amine signaling and metabolism. Measurements of differences in neurotransmitters have not been made among ant colonies in a natural environment. Here, for the first time, we quantified tissue content of 4 biogenic amines (dopamine, serotonin, octopamine, and tyramine) in single forager brains from 9 red harvester ant colonies collected in the field. Capillary electrophoresis coupled with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (CE-FSCV) was used to separate and detect the amines in individual ant brains. Low levels of biogenic amines were detected using field-amplified sample stacking by preparing a single brain tissue sample in acetonitrile and perchloric acid. The method provides low detection limits: 1 nM for dopamine, 2 nM for serotonin, 5 nM for octopamine, and 4 nM for tyramine. Overall, the content of dopamine (47\tÂ±\t9 pg/brain) was highest, followed by octopamine (36\tÂ±\t10 pg/brain), serotonin (20\tÂ±\t4 pg/brain), and tyramine (14\tÂ±\t3 pg/brain). Relative standard deviations were high, but there was less variation within a colony than among colonies, so the neurotransmitter content of each colony might change with environmental conditions. This study demonstrates that CE-FSCV is a useful method for investigating natural variation in neurotransmitter content in single ant brains and could be useful for future studies correlating tissue content with colony behavior such as foraging.",

We investigated whether differences in whole-brain levels of the biogenic amines dopamine (DA), serotonin (5HT), and octopamine (OA) are associated with task specialization and genotype in similarly sized and aged workers of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior, a polyandrous species in which genotype correlates with worker task specialization. We compared amine levels of foragers and waste management workers to test for an association with worker task, and young in-nest workers across patrilines to test for a genetic influence on brain amine levels. Foragers had higher levels of DA and OA and a higher OA:5HT ratio than waste management workers. Patrilines did not significantly differ in amine levels or their ratios, although patriline affected worker body size, which correlated with amine levels despite the small size range sampled. Levels of all three amines were correlated within individuals in both studies. Among patrilines, mean levels of DA and OA, and OA and 5HT were also correlated. Our results suggest that differences in biogenic amines could regulate worker task specialization, but may be not be significantly affected by genotype.",

Significant effects of biogenic amine administration were observed almost exclusively in the case of confrontations with allospecific opponents.  Serotonin treatment exerted stimulatory effects on behavior patterns involving physical aggression (biting accompanied by gaster flexing, dragging, formic acid spraying), but these effects were relatively weak &/or documented by indirect evidence.  Dopamine administration exerted a stimulatory effect on open-mandible threats directed by F. polyctena to F. fusca & to cricket nymphs, & on biting behavior directed to cricket nymphs.  Surprisingly, octopamine treatment did not exert significant effects on aggressive behavior of the tested ants.  Tyramine administration exerted a suppressing effect on threatening behavior directed to F. fusca, but led to shortening of the latencies to the first open-mandible threat during the tests with cricket nymphs.  Biogenic amine administration also influenced non-aggressive behavior of the tested ants.  Our findings confirmed the role of serotonin & dopamine in the mediation of ant aggressive behavior & documented for the first time significant effects of tyramine treatment on ant aggressive behavior.  We also demonstrated that not only specific patterns of ant aggressive behavior, but also behavioral effects of biogenic amine treatments are as a rule strongly context-dependent.]",

    "abstract": "Nestmate recognition is a critical element in social insect organization, providing a means to maintain territoriality and close the colony to parasites and predators. Ants detect the colony chemical label via their antennae and respond to the label mismatch of an intruder with aggressive behavior. In the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, worker ability to recognize conspecific nonnestmates decreases if the colony queen is removed, such that they do not recognize conspecific nonnestmates as different. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of the colony queen influences the concentration of octopamine, a neuromodulator, in worker ants, which in turn has an effect on nestmate recognition acuity in workers. We demonstrate that queenless workers exhibit reduced brain octopamine levels and reduced discriminatory acuteness; however, feeding queenless workers octopamine restored both. Dopamine levels are influenced by honeybee queen pheromones; however, levels of this biogenic amine were unchanged in our experiments. This is the first demonstration of a link between the presence of the colony queen, a worker biogenic amine, and conspecific nestmate recognition, a powerful expression of colony cohesion and territoriality.

    "abstract": "Social insect workers usually participate first in intranidal tasks (i.e. act as nurses within the nest) and then switch to extranidal tasks and become foragers. However, foragers sometimes switch back again to brood care and become reverted nurses. Behavioural and physiological correlates of the transition nurse-forager (behavioural maturation) and forager-reverted nurse (behavioural reversion) are relatively well known in the honeybee, although they are less explored in ants. To understand better the role of biogenic amines in ant behavioural maturation and behavioural reversion, the levels of octopamine (OA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) are examined in the brains of nurses, foragers and reverted nurses of the red wood ant Formica polyctena FË†rst. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Brain OA levels and the ratios OA : DA and OA : 5-HT are higher in nurses than in foragers and reverted nurses. Reverted nurses and foragers do not differ significantly with respect to brain biogenic amine levels and amine ratios. Biogenic amine levels in brains of workers of F. polyctena are thus maturation-related rather than task-related. This is one of the first studies of neurochemical correlates of ant behavioural maturation and the first attempt to identify neurobiological correlates of ant behavioural reversion. The data obtained provide further evidence that neurobiological processes underlying honeybee and ant behavioural maturation and behavioural reversion reveal important differences.",
