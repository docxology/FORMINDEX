    "abstract": "There is growing evidence for the influence of plant intraspecific variation on associated multi-trophic communities, but the traits driving such effects are largely unknown. We conducted a field experiment with selected genetic lines of the dioecious shrub Baccharis salicifolia to investigate the effects of plant growth rate (two-fold variation) and gender (males vs. females of the same growth rate) on above- and belowground insect and fungal associates. We documented variation in associate density to test for effects occurring through plant-based habitat quality (controlling for effects of plant size) as well as variation in associate abundance to test for effects occurring through both habitat quality and abundance (including effects of plant size). Whereas the dietary specialist aphid Uroleucon macolai was unaffected by plant sex and growth rate, the generalist aphid Aphis gossypii and its tending ants (Linepithema humile) had higher abundances and densities on male (vs. female) plants, suggesting males provide greater habitat quality. In contrast, Aphis and ant abundance and density were unaffected by plant growth rate, while Aphis parasitoids were unaffected by either plant sex or growth rate. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi had higher abundance and density (both marginally significant) on females (vs. males), suggesting females provide greater habitat quality, but lower abundances (marginally significant) and higher densities on slow- (vs. fast-) growing genotypes, suggesting slow-growing genotypes provided lower resource abundance but greater habitat quality. Overall, plant sex and growth rate effects on associates acted independently (i.e., no interactive effects), and these effects were of a greater magnitude than those coming from other axes of plant genetic variation. These findings thus demonstrate that plant genetic effects on associated communities may be driven by a small number of trait-specific mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are a leading cause of global change, yet their long\u0010term effects remain hard to predict. Invasive species can remain abundant for long periods of time, or exhibit population crashes that allow native communities to recover. The abundance and impact of nonnative species may also be closely tied to temporally variable habitat characteristics. We investigated the long\u0010term effects of habitat fragmentation and invasion by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) by resurveying ants in 40 scrub habitat fragments in coastal southern California that were originally sampled 21 yr ago. At a landscape scale, fragment area, but not fragment age or Argentine ant mean abundance, continued to explain variation in native ant species richness; the species\u0013area relationship between the two sample years did not differ in terms of slope or intercept. At local scales, over the last 21 yr we detected increases in the overall area invaded (+36.7%, estimated as the proportion of occupied traps) and the relative abundance of the Argentine ant (+121.95%, estimated as mean number of workers in pitfall traps). Argentine ant mean abundance also increased inward from urban edges in 2017 compared to 1996. The greater level of penetration into fragments likely reduced native ant richness by eliminating refugia for native ants in fragments that did not contain sufficient interior area. At one fragment where we sampled eight times over the last 21 yr, Argentine ant mean abundance increased over time while the diversity of native ground\u0010foraging ants declined from 14 to 4 species. Notably, native species predicted to be particularly sensitive to the combined effect of invasion and habitat loss were not detected at any sites in our recent sampling, including the army ant genus Neivamyrmex. Conversely, two introduced ant species (Brachymyrmex patagonicus and Pheidole flavens) that were undetected in 1996 are now common and widespread at our sites. Our results indicate that behaviorally and numerically dominant invasive species can maintain high densities and suppress native diversity for extended periods.          *[In 2017, we collected a total of 42,002 ant workers belonging to 28 aboveground foraging species (32 total native species) & 5 introduced species (Appendix S1: Table S2).  Pitfall traps located in unfragmented plots within the Elliott reserve, where 9,705 of these workers were collected, did not capture any introduced species.]          *[ Forelius mccooki misspelled Forelius maccooki.]",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined impacts of fire on invertebrates in southern California ecosystems despite the fact they harbor diverse invertebrate assemblages with many narrowly endemic species. California sage scrub, an endangered ecosystem type of low-elevation areas in southern California, is increasingly threatened by altered fire regimes and type conversion to non-native grasslands often resulting from fire disturbances. The effect of fire on ant assemblages in a patch of recovering sage scrub was examined by using adjacent intact sage scrub and non-native grassland habitats as checks. While short-term effects in ant activity potentially associated with temporary changes in habitat structure and abiotic conditions were observed, ant assemblages in the burned area did not differ between summer 2013 (pre-fire) and fall 2013 (post-fire), or between spring 2013 (pre-fire) and spring 2014 (post-fire). Results indicated that either the ant assemblages recover quickly, or more likely, pre-existing ant assemblage remained and were not directly impacted by fire. Our results, combined with the few other studies that examined impacts of fire on sage scrub invertebrates, are consistent with an emerging hypothesis that ground-dwelling ant/invertebrate assemblages are little affected by direct impacts of fire in semi-arid systems and areas where fires are common.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region of Solenopsis invicta virus 1 (SINV-1) was sequenced from 47 infected colonies of S. invicta, S. richteri, S. geminata, and S. invicta/richteri hybrids collected from across the USA, northern Argentina, and northern Taiwan in an attempt to infer demographic information about the recent S. invicta introduction into Taiwan by phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences were calculated to exhibit an overall identity of >90% between geographically-separated samples. A total of 171 nucleotide variable sites (representing 22.4% of the region amplified) were mapped across the SINV-1 RdRp alignment and no insertions or deletions were detected.  Phylogenetic analysis at the nucleotide level revealed clustering of Argentinean sequences, distinct from the USA sequences. Moreover, the SINV-1 RdRp sequences derived from recently introduced populations of S. invicta from northern Taiwan resided within the multiple USA groupings implicating the USA as the source for the recent introduction of S. invicta into Taiwan. Examination of the amino acid alignment for the RdRp revealed sequence identity >98% with only nine amino acid changes observed. Seven of these changes occurred in less than 4.3% of samples, while 2 (at positions 1266 and 1285) were featured prominently. Changes at positions 1266 and 1285 accounted for 36.2% and 34.0% of the samples, respectively. Two distinct groups were observed based on the amino acid residue at position 1266, Threonine or Serine. In cases where this amino acid was a Threonine, 90% of these sequences possessed a corresponding Valine at position 1285; only 10% of the Threonine1266-containing sequences possessed an Isoleucine at the 1285 position. Among the Serine1266 group, 76% possessed an Isoleucine at position 1285, while only 24% possessed a Valine. Thus, it appears that the Threonine1266/Valine1285 and Serine1266/Isoleucine1285 combinations are predominant phenotypes.

Six species of ants coexisted in the abandoned orchard, whereas only 2 species were found in the managed orchards.  In both the organic & sprayed, clean cultivated systems, ants were more abundant in the orchard edges than in the vegetation-free centers.  This trend was not apparent in the abandoned or organic cover orchards, where plant diversity in the center was similar to that of the edges.  Ant predation on potato tuberworm larvae, Phthorimaea operculella, artificially placed on the orchard floor, declined with the intensity of management & vegetational simplication.  A higher incidence of larval removal occurred in the edges than in the centers of the clean cultivated orchards.  No noticeable populations of ants were detected on the trees in any of the orchards.  Increased vegetational diversity & lack of disturbance appeared to affect ant locomotory activity & foraging efficiency by creating preferred sheltering & feeding sites.]",

The Argentine ant disrupts natural ecosystems by displacing native ant species and associating with phloem-feeding insects, which they protect from natural enemies in exchange for honeydew excreted by the phloem-feeders. Thus, interactions between these ants and phloem-feeders can be an issue of critical importance in agroecosystems. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the presence or absence of another invasive pest, Asian Citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, adjacent habitat types, and edge complexity impact the species richness, activity, and distribution of ants including the Argentine ant within citrus groves in southern California. When ACP were present and edge complexity was higher, ant activity rates were higher, yet we observed a decline in total ant species richness. Surrounding habitat type had no effect on ant activity or total ant species richness. Understanding the spatial patterns of both the Argentine ant and ACP can aid future management practices for controlling both Argentine ants and Asian citrus psyllid populations.",

    "abstract": "Invasive ants are amongst the most destructive and widespread invaders across the globe; they can strongly alter invaded ecosystems and are responsible for the loss of native ant species. Several studies have reported that invasive ants can also lead to substantial economic costs. In this study, we search, describe and analyse 1342 reported costs of invasive ants compiled in the InvaCost database. Economic costs, reported since 1930 for 12 ant species in 27 countries, totalled US$ 51.93 billion, from which US$ 10.95 billion were incurred, and US$ 40.98 billion were potential costs (i.e., expected or predicted costs). More than 80% of total costs were associated with only two species, Solenopsis invicta and Wasmannia auropunctata; and two countries, the USA and Australia. Overall, damage costs amounted to 92% of the total cost, mainly impacting the agriculture, public and social welfare sectors. Management costs were primarily post-invasion management (US$ 1.79 billion), with much lower amounts dedicated to prevention (US$ 235.63 million). Besides the taxonomic bias, cost information was lacking for an average of 78% of the invaded countries. Moreover, even in countries where costs were reported, such information was available for only 56% of the invaded locations. Our synthesis suggests that the global costs of invasive ants are massive but largely biased towards developed economies, with a huge proportion of underreported costs, and thus most likely grossly underestimated. We advocate for more and improved cost reporting of invasive ants through better collaborations between managers, practitioners and researchers, a crucial basis for adequately informing future budgets and improving proactive management actions of invasive ants.",

Pitfall trapping was used to collect litter-arthropods before and immediately after treatments in replicated forest compartments.  Rank-abundance diagrams indicated that much of the change in the beetle assemblage due to the treatments wasa result of changes in the numbers of rare species.  Some common beetle species, families of beetles, and other common groups such as ants and spiders showed changes in abundance due to the treatments, but the changes were taxon-specific and showed no general pattern.  Overall impacts of the treatments appear to be moderate, and the increased habitat heterogeneity at the compartment level may provide additional habitat for many rare-species to coexist.]",

During the course of the soil surveys of eastern Merced and Stanislaus Counties of California, where mound microrelief is widespread, the phenomenon was studied over a period of eight years. All known theories were evaluated and compared with the evidence which could be observed in the field. The evidence includes the nature of the mounds such as shape, size, internal structure, distribution of gravel, the burrows of ants and rodents; the distribution of the microrelief with respect to soil types and the pattern of occurrence of mounds under various conditions. The theories of origin which were tested included erosional theories based on wind action and water action, fluviatile, submarine and sub-lacustrine currents; eruptional theories suggesting gas-vents, sand boils and hydrostatic pressure; and biological theories based upon the activity of ants, ground squirrels and pocket gophers. It is concluded that the evidence points clearly to a biological explanation, and that the pocket gopher is responsible for Mima mound microrelief.",

    "abstract": "Ants intercepted by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture in 2018 and 2019 identified as Solenopsis spp., and possibly S. invicta, were submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service-Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology, Imported Fire Ant and Household Insects Research Unit for further taxonomic assessment using genetic and chemical methods. The 2018 sample consisted of 1 worker ant, and the 2019 sample consisted of 3 worker ants. Thoraces were used for genetic assessment and gasters were used for venom analyses. It was determined readily from genetic and chemical analyses that the intercepted ants were not S. invicta or S. richteri. Mitochondrial COX1 gene sequences were compared with previously published data from Solenopsis species. The closest match for the 2018 sample was S. xyloni, which is native to the shipment's origin (San Diego, California, USA). The 2 major alkaloids found were characteristic of the S. geminata species group. In addition, the alkaloid ratio closely matched that of S. xyloni. Therefore, the alkaloid analysis of the 2018 intercepted ant concurs with the genetic data that the ant was an S. xyloni worker. The COX1 gene sequences of the 2019 interceptions most closely matched S. geminata. The corresponding venom alkaloid profile also eliminated S. invicta and S. richteri as possibilities. However, 1 major alkaloid was unusual (Fig. 2) and normally is found only in trace amounts. We suggest the 2019 specimens are an unusual variant of S. geminata.

An assessment of genetic variation at a diverse set of molecular markers in 2144 fire ant colonies from 75 geographic sites worldwide revealed that at least nine separate introductions of S. invicta have occurred into newly invaded areas and that the main southern U.S. population is probably the source of all but one of these introductions. The sole exception involves a putative serial invasion from the southern United States to California to Taiwan. These results illustrate in stark fashion a severe negative consequence of an increasingly massive and interconnected global trade and travel system.  ©AAAS.

    "abstract": "Tradeoffs in functional traits facilitate species coexistence within communities and are important contributors to community assembly. Two aspects of a life-history tradeoff known to structure ant communities include foraging efficiency (i.e. resource discovery and retrieval) and competitive dominance (territoriality and survivorship following competition).  This work examined these aspects in workers of two fire ant species (Solenopsis xyloni and Solenopsis geminata) and their F1 hybrids using laboratory experiments.  Parental foraging strategies were consistent with a tradeoff between discovery efficiency and competitive territorial dominance. Desert-adapted S. xyloni was the most efficient forager but the least effective territory defender; mesic-adapted S. geminata was a less efficient forager, but fared best in competition trials. Hybrid workers were generally intermediate, leading to increased survival by hybrids in competitive encounters with S. geminata compared with the performance of S. xyloni.  These findings suggest that traits associated with foraging and competitive ability in the parental species are subject to environmental filtering; across habitats, species with a similar dominance rank in their respective communities differ in their placement along the discovery-dominance axis.  Interspecific hybridization may play a role in extending eastern range limits of S. xyloni via shifting colony allocation towards the strategy of its competitor. In the overlap zone, S. xyloni with hybrid workers may be sufficiently competitive to persist with S. geminata, while colonies with S. xyloni workers cannot, providing a substantial selective advantage to hybridization for S. xyloni queens that may explain the unusual hybridogenetic social structure of this population.",

    "abstract": "When postulating evolutionary hypotheses for diverse groups of taxa using molecular data, there is a tradeoff between sampling large numbers of taxa with a few Sanger\u0010sequenced genes or sampling fewer taxa with hundreds to thousands of next\u0010generation\u0010sequenced genes. High taxon sampling enables the testing of evolutionary hypotheses that are sensitive to sampling bias (i.e. dating, biogeography and diversification analyses), whereas high character sampling improves resolution of critical nodes. In a group of ant parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Eucharitidae: Oraseminae), we analyse both of these types of datasets independently (203 taxa with five Sanger loci, 92 taxa with 348 anchored hybrid enrichment loci) and in combination (229 taxa, 353 loci) to explore divergence dating, biogeography, host relationships and differential rates of diversification. Oraseminae specialize as parasitoids of the immature stages of ants in the subfamily Myrmicinae (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), with ants in the genus Pheidole being their most common and presumed ancestral host. A general assumption is that the distribution of the parasite must be limited by any range contraction or expansion of its host. Recent studies support a single New World to Old World dispersal pattern for Pheidole at c. 11-27\tMa. Using multiple phylogenetic inference methods (parsimony, maximum likelihood, dated Bayesian and coalescent analyses), we provide a robust phylogeny showing that Oraseminae dispersed in the opposite direction, from Old World to New World, c. 24-33\tMa, which implies that they existed in the Old World before their presumed ancestral hosts. Their dispersal into the New World appears to have promoted an increased diversification rate. Both the host and parasitoid show single unidirectional dispersals in accordance with the presence of the Beringian Land Bridge during the Oligocene, a time when the changing northern climate probably limited the dispersal ability of such tropically adapted groups.          *[Ant species listed from Table S1: Oraseminae ant and plant host records.]",

    "abstract": "The ecological effects of species introductions can change over time, but an understanding of how and why they do remains hindered by the lack of long-term data sets that permit investigation into underlying causes. We employed stable isotope analysis to estimate how trophic position changes as a function of time for the Argentine ant, a widespread, abundant, and ecologically disruptive introduced species. Previous research at a site in southern California (Rice Canyon, San Diego Co.) found that Argentine ant ¥πuN values were higher at the leading edge of invasion than at those same sites in years subsequent to invasion (i.e., after the invasion front had advanced). To assess if a reduction in relative trophic position over time is a typical feature of Argentine ant invasions, we expanded the temporal and spatial scale of sampling and measured ¥πuN values of the Argentine ant at three locations with a known or inferred history of invasion: Rice Canyon (the location of the original study), the Sacramento River Valley (Yolo and Solano Cos., CA), and San Nicolas Island (Ventura Co., CA). Resampling Rice Canyon in 2019, 16 years after the original survey, revealed a significant increase in Argentine ant ¥πuN values. At the two other locations, Argentine ant ¥πuN values were independent of time since invasion (Sacramento River Valley) or position relative to the invasion front (San Nicolas Island). These findings suggest that post-invasion reductions in trophic position may not be a general phenomenon or could reflect transitory ecological processes that require finer-scale temporal sampling than was possible to achieve in the present study. Our findings are nonetheless consistent with the results of recent studies, which found that the effects of Argentine ant invasions persist over decadal time scales.",

    "abstract": "The species belonging to the ant genus Macromischa are transferred to Leptothorax, but the name Macromischa is still maintained in the literature as a subgenus of Leptothorax. Despite of the numerous morphological peculiarities shown by several 'Macromischa' species, it is impossible to trace a clear boundary between them and Leptothorax acervorum, the type species of the latter genus.  Macromischa is still retained as a subgeneric name mainly because its members show the most remarkable case of explosive speciation in ants which is, moreover, one of the conspicuous evolutionary patterns of the Antillean and Central American faunae as a whole.  The following species are recognized in the present revision: L. aguayoi (Wheeler) from Cuba, L. alayoi n. sp. from Cuba, L. albispina (Wheeler) (= ssp. pallipes Mann, n. syn.) from Puerto Rico, L. allardycei (Mann) (= Antillaemyrmex floridanus Wheeler, n. syn.) from the Bahamas and florida, L. androsanus (Wheeler) from the Bahamas and Cuba, L. anemicus n. name and n. status (temptative) (for Macromischa bermudezi var. gracilis Aguayo) from Cuba, L. annexus n. name (for Macromischa annectens Wheeler) from Mexico, L. augusti n. name (for Macromischa foreli Aguayo) from Mexico, L. aztecus (Wheeler) (= var. maya Wheeler, n. syn.) from Mexico and Guatemala, L. barbouri (Aguayo) from Cuba, L. barroi (Aguayo) n. status (temptaticve) from Cuba, L. bermudezi (Wheeler) (= var. mutabilis Wheeler n. syn.) from Cuba, L. bruneri (Mann) (= ssp. imitatrix Wheeler, n. syn., = ssp. ornatipes Wheeler, n. syn. = ssp. proxima Wheeler, n. syn.) from Cuba, L. ciferrii (menozzi & Russo) from Los Sietes Hermanos Islands, L. creightoni (Mann) from Cuba, L. creolus n. sp. from the Dominican republic, L. darlingtoni (Wheeler) from Cuba, L. dissinilis (Aguayo) (=Macromischa chloana Wheeler) from Cuba, L. flavidulus (Wheeler and Mann) from Haiti, L. fuscatus (Mann) from Guatemala, L. gibbifer n. sp. from Cuba, L. goniops n. sp. from Mexico, L. gundlachi (Wheeler) from Cuba, L. hispaniolae n. sp. from the Dominican republic, L. huehuetenangoi n. sp. from Guatemala, L. hyperisabellae n. sp. from Puerto Rico, L. ixili n. sp. from Guatemala, L. leucacanthus n. sp. from Mexico, L. mortoni (Aguayo) from Cuba, L. muticus (Smith) n. status from Puerto Rico, L. myersi (Wheeler) from Cuba, L. ocarinae n. sp. from Mexico, L. opalinus (Wheeler) from Cuba, L. pastinifer (Emery) (= var. opaciceps, = Macromischa lucayensis Forel n. syn.) from Cuba, Bahamas (and Haiti?), L. pastoris n. sp. from Cuba, L. platycnemis (Wheeler) from Cuba, L. poeyi (Wheeler) from Cuba, L. politus (Smith) from Arizona, L. porphyritis (Roger) (= var. latispina Wheeler, n. syn. = Macromischa jaumei Santschi n. syn.) from Cuba, L. pulchellus (Emery) from the Antilles, L. punicans (Roger) from Cuba, L. purporatus (Roger) from Cuba, L. rugiceps (Aguayo) n. status from Cuba, L. sallei (GuÈrin) (= ssp. haytiana Wheeler and Mann, n. syn., = ssp. opacinoda Wheeler n. syn.) from Hispaniola, L. salvini (Forel) from Panama [it  has been impossible to see material attributed or attributable to L. salvini var. oscurior (Forel), sympatric with the typical form], L. scabripes (Mann) (doubtful good species, = var. brunneipes Wheeler, n. syn.) from Cuba, L. schwarzi (Mann) from Cuba, L. senectutis n. sp. from Cuba, L. simimilis n. name (for Macromischa affinis Mann = ssp. laeta Wheeler n. syn. = ssp. maerens Wheeler, n. syn.) from Cuba, L. skwarrae (Wheeler) from Mexico, L. splendens (Wheeler) from the Bahamas, L. squamifer (Roger (= var. atrinodis Mann, n. syn.) from Cuba, L. subditivus (Wheeler) = Macromischa laevissima Wheeler n. syn., = Macromischa flavitarsis Mann, n. syn., = Macromischa luciliae Mann, n. syn.) from California, Texas, Louisiana, Mexico, Guatemala and Panama, L. tenuisculptus n. sp. from Mexico, L. terricolus (Mann) from Cuba, L. torrei (Aguayo) from Cuba, L. totonicapani n. sp. from Guatemala, L. umbratipes (Wheeler) n. status (tempatative) from Cuba, L. versicolor (Roger) (= Macromischa lugens Roger n. syn., = M. lugens var. nigra Santschi n. syn.) from Cuba, L. violaceus (Mann) from Cuba, L. wheeleri (Mann) (= ssp. petri Aguayo n. syn.) from Cuba, L. williami n. name (for Macromischa manni Wheeler) (= var. villarensis Aguayo n. syn.)from Cuba, undescribed n. species A (based on a single female from Florida), undescribed n. species B (based on a single male from the Bahamas).  These species are grouped into 12 species groups and three keys for the identification of the known workers, females and males are presented. It is expected that several new species will be added to this list in the future. The scanty information available suggests that the males, once better known, will provide the paramount criteria for a stable classification.  The subgenus Macromischa is probably polyphyletic and many of the morphological peculiarities of its members are likely to be due to convergent evolution. There is now sufficient evidence to recognize at least two main speciation centers: one in Cuba including mainly species adapted to live in the soil or in the crevices of limestone, and another in South Mexico and Guatemala, including mainly arboreal species often living in in intimate relationship with orchids and other epiphytes.  It is shown for the first time that the 'carton entrances' of the nests of the species living in crevices of the rocks ae made by silk, but it has been not possible to ascertain wether the silk is produced by the ant larvae or stolen by the workers from spiders. In any case, this represents the first documented record of silk nests for a member of the subfamily Myrmicinae. One of the most peculiar morphological characters of several of these species is the marked elongation of the appendages, sometimes coupled with a marked inflation of the middle and posterior femora, unknown in other ants.  The author suggests that this may be an adaptive trend correlated with the defense behavior of Macromischa. In fact, at least the medium and large sized species are known to severely sting from an unusual posture: the gaster is bent under the body and the sting is directe forwards ventrally. The elongated petiole clearly facilitates and increases the success of such a manoeuvre and the development of the legs is likely to be correlated with this function. But, for the ant to remain stable in this posture, there is also an increase of the levator muscles of the tibiae which could easily account for the incrassated femora previously mentioned. One new species described from Cuban orchids (L. gibbifer) shows inflations on both, femora and tibiae, and it is obvious that the previous hypothesis can satisfactorily explain also this morphological peculiarity.",

    "note": "Part of FORMIS 12; from-DPW,",
    "abstract": "*[The argentine ant, Linepithema humile, short-distance dispersal process (colony budding) is poorly understood.   A stochastic computer simulation composed of a linear population demographics model & a random-walk movement model was created in MatlabR.  The seasonality of L. humile's reproductive, behavioral, & structural dynamics (such as dry season expansion, wet season contraction) were included within the demographics & movement models.   Analysis of simulation output using a statistical general linear model showed that yearly spread rate d was predicted by two parameters: beta, the queen count at which there was a 50% chance of emigration & the average monthly emigration distance.  The general linear model showed that spread rate, d, increased significantly with B, the mean monthly emigration distance.  After accounting for the effect of B, yearly spread rate depended negatively & significantly on the emigration parameter.  The effect of B on d decreased as  got larger. With a lower queen emigration rate (high beta) the expected monthly distance traveled had a lower effect on colony spread rate than when emigration rate is higher. As beta ranged from 2 to 10, mean monthly emigration distances between 17 and 26 meters were required to produce the average annual colony expansion rate of about 105 m/yr reported in the literature.  These monthly emigration distances were consistent with observed values, suggesting that the model successfully captured the dynamics of an expanding argentine ant colony.   Model results suggest that colony spread rate increases as a result of 2 factors: 1) higher frequency of rare, long-distance dispersal events, & 2) greater persistence of newly established nests through the winter.]",

    "abstract": "Ants were the most apparent invertebrate scavengers observed  foraging on entomopathogenic nematode-killed insects (i.e., insect cadavers containing entomopathogenic nematodes and their symbiotic bacteria) in the present study. Workers of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), scavenged nematode-killed insects on the surface and those buried 2 cm  below the soil surface. Ant workers scavenged significantly more steinernematid-killed (60-85%) than heterorhabditid- killed (10-20%) insects. More 4-day-postinfected cadavers (hosts died within 48 h after exposure to nematodes) were scavenged than 10-day-postinfected cadavers. Ten-day-postinfected hosts contained live infective juvenile nematodes therefore ants may serve as phoretic agents. Other ant species, including Veromessor andrei (Mayr), Pheidole  vistana Forel, Formica pacifica Francoeur, and Monomorium ergatogyna Wheeler, also scavenged nematode-killed insects.  These ant species removed or destroyed about 45% of the steinernematid-killed insects. These results suggest that survival of steinernematid nematodes may be more significantly impacted by invertebrate scavengers, especially  ants, than that of heterorhabditid nematodes, and placement of steinernematid-killed insects in the field for biological control may be an ineffective release strategy. Because  entomopathogenic nematodes kill insects with the help of symbiotic bacteria, we tested the role of these bacterial species in deterring invertebrate scavengers by injecting bacteria (without nematodes) into insects and placing the  cadavers in the field. None of the insects killed by the symbiotic bacterium, Photorhabdus luminescens (Thomas and Poinar) from Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar, were scavanged, whereas 70% of the insects killed by the symbiotic bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophilus (Poinar and Thomas) from Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser), and 90% of the insects killed by Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner were scavenged by the Argentine ant. We conclude that P. luminescens is responsible for preventing ants from foraging on heterorhabditid-killed hosts.",

In this work, we studied the tritrophic interaction among this mealybug, its main parasitoid Acerophagus n. sp. near coccois (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and tending ants to disclose the success of this parasitoid controlling P. peruvianus. Acerophagus n. sp. near coccois accepted mealybugs for parasitism regardless of their size but did not host-feed. We recorded three active defenses of P. peruvianus. Host handling time was not influenced by these host defenses but was a time-consuming process that required more than 30 min. Tending ants, Lasius grandis (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), reduced the time spent by parasitoids in a patch and disrupted oviposition attempts. The low numbers of ants tending mealybug colonies in Spain and France could explain why this parasitoid, with a long handling time, is an efficient biological control agent for P. peruvianus.",

    "abstract": "Geographic range has long been noted to be associated with many organismic and ecological traits such as body size and species richness. However, much less is known about whether and how ecological variation across latitudinal gradients reflects behavioral variation. Ant colonies may also show behavioral variation, and Temnothorax rugatulus show a colony-level behavioral syndrome that seems to reflect risk tolerance across their North American range. While it is presumed that this pattern is the result of adaptation to local environmental conditions, which ecological factors are driving this variation are unknown. Here, we test if colony risk tolerance is affected by competition, predation, resource availability, or environmental stress at each site. Our results show that increased competition, specifically for nest sites, as well as increased spatial clustering of colonies predicts higher risk tolerance. Additionally, the spatial clustering of colonies influences the structure of the risk-taking syndrome, i.e., which colony-level behaviors are correlated and how strongly. This emphasizes the need for understanding large-scale geographic variation in behavior, as it may explain how ecological factors drive the evolution and maintenance of intraspecific behavioral variation across populations.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent interest in animal personality and behavioral syndromes, there is a paucity of explanations for why distinct behavioral traits should evolve to correlate. We investigate whether such correlations across apparently distinct behavioral traits may be explained by variation in life history strategy among individual ant colonies. Life history theory predicts that the way in which individuals allocate energy towards somatic maintenance or reproduction drives several distinct traits in physiology, morphology, and energy use; it also predicts that an individual's willingness to engage in risky behaviors should depend on reproductive strategy. We use Temnothorax ants, which have been shown to exhibit 'personalities' and a syndrome that may reflect risk tolerance at the colony level. We measure colonies\u0019 relative investment in growth rate (new workers produced) compared to reproductive effort (males and queens produced). Comparing sterile worker production to reproductive alate production provides a direct measure of how colonies are investing their energy, analogous to investment in growth versus reproduction in a unitary organism. Consistently with this idea, we found that behavioral type of ant colonies was associated with their life history strategy: risk\u0010tolerant colonies grew faster and invested more in reproduction, whereas risk\u0010averse colonies had lower growth rate but invested relatively more in workers. This provides evidence that behavioral syndromes can be a consequence of life\u0010history strategy variation, linking the two fields and supporting the use of an integrative approach.",

When food density was low, colonies foraged in long, narrow columns extending linearly outward from the nest entrance. The columns rotated around the nest, and, in time, a circular area was covered. Both the length of the column and the rate of rotation increased with decreasing food density. Under conditions of relatively high food density, the foragers searched for seeds individually, without apparent behavioral cohesion. Each of the three species decreased intraspecific competition by regular spacing of colonies. Interspecific competition was reduced by partially distinct population distributions along the altitudinal gradient. For two species, colonies had a constant foraging area size regardless of altitude or season. For these colonies, time spent searching for food is a good indication of available food. As food density increases, colonies of species with smaller foraging areas become more abundant.",

In colonies that feed on seeds, absolute size of foragers is related to the size of seeds taken; in colonies that feed on insects, absolute size of the foragers is related to foraging distance. The percent variation in forager size is best correlated, in all colony types, with size of the foraging area. In island communities with fewer ant species, the mean forager size is smaller and the coefficient of variation in forager size greater. The presence of slaves was found to increase both range of foraging temperatures and the variety of foods utilized by slave-making colonies.          *[Samples of 20 foragers per colony, 4 colonies per population, were used to estimate niche breadths.  A total of 61 populations of 21 species, from 13 different communities in the western U.S.A. were sampled.  In addition, forager size was measured for all species found on 9 islands in the northern Gulf of California and compared with species found in matched habitat sites in east-central Baja & southern Arizona.  The matched habitat site on the eastern Baja Peninsula had 11 species, & 14 species were found in similar habitat near Tucson, Arizona.

Overdispersed patterns of nest distribution were common among the colonies of conspecifics.  Such patterns are believed to result directly from defense of foraging areas & indirectly from intraspecific competition for food.  Little evidence of non-random dispersion patterns was found when the colony positions of 2 species were considered together.  The dispersion pattern of all the colonies of all species in a community is uniformly spaced at lower elevations, random at intermediate elevations, & aggregated at higher elevations.  The trend towards increased aggregations is believed to be due to the increase in vegetation density with elevation.  This would tend to limit the areas where ant colonies can be successfully established to unshaded areas between perennial plants.  Size of foraging area was found to decrease with increase in both elevation & latitude.  It is postulated that size of the foraging area for these ants is negatively correlated with density of food.

    "abstract": "The evolution of weaponry occurs less frequently in females than in males and is most often important for protecting ecological resources or offspring rather than winning mates. The purpose of female weapons is often confounded by the presence of similar weapons in males, so cases where only females need weapons provide important tests of our understanding of how and why weapons evolve. In some populations of the ant, Messor pergandei (Mayr), newly mated queens initiate new nests in social groups that subsequently break down when queens engage in battles for control. The incipient social environment differs geographically, so that lethal fighting occurs in some populations but not others. Consistent with the hypothesis that queens in populations where lethal fighting occurs should show selection for weaponry (broad heads and strong mandibles), we found that heads of queens from sites where lethal fighting occurs were broader than those at sites with non-fighting queens and a site with solitary queens. Evolution of weaponry is specific to queens, because regression results from workers often did not follow this pattern",

    "abstract": "This study unravels the evolution and biogeographic history of the globally distributed ant genus Crematogaster on the basis of a molecular phylogeny, reconstructed from five nuclear protein-coding genes and a total of 3384 bp of sequence data. A particular emphasis is placed on the evolutionary history of these ants in the Malagasy region. Bayesian and likelihood analyses performed on a dataset of 124 Crematogaster ingroup taxa lend strong support for three deeply diverging phylogenetic lineages within the genus: the Orthocrema clade, the Global Crematogaster clade and the Australo-Asian Crematogaster clade. The 15 previous subgenera within Crematogaster are mostly not monophyletic. Divergence dating analyses and ancestral range reconstructions suggest that Crematogaster evolved in South-East Asia in the mid-Eocene (40-45 ma). The three major lineages also originated in this region in the late Oligocene/early Miocene (~24-30 ma). A first dispersal out of S-E Asia by an Orthocrema lineage is supported for 22-30 ma to the Afrotropical region. Successive dispersal events out of S-E Asia began in the early, and continued throughout the late Miocene. The global distribution of Crematogaster was achieved by subsequent colonizations of all major biogeographic regions by the Orthocrema and the Global Crematogaster clade. Molecular dating estimates and ancestral range evolution are discussed in the light of palaeogeographic changes in the S-E Asian region and an evolving ocean circulation system throughout the Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene. Eight dispersal events to/from Madagascar by Crematogaster are supported, with most events occurring in the late Miocene to Pliocene (5.0-9.5 ma). These results suggest that Crematogaster ants possess exceptional dispersal and colonization abilities, and emphasize the need for detailed investigations of traits that have contributed to the global evolutionary success of these ants.",

    "abstract": "Background:  Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) have been successfully used in phylogenomics for a variety of taxa, but their power in phylogenetic inference has yet to be extensively compared with that of traditional Sanger sequencing data sets. Moreover, UCE data on invertebrates, including insects, are sparse. We compared the phylogenetic informativeness of 959 UCE loci with a multi-locus data set of ten nuclear markers obtained via Sanger sequencing, testing the ability of these two types of data to resolve and date the evolutionary history of the second most species-rich subfamily of ants in the world, the Formicinae.  Results:  Phylogenetic analyses show that UCEs are superior in resolving ancient and shallow relationships in formicine ants, demonstrated by increased node support and a more resolved phylogeny. Phylogenetic informativeness metrics indicate a twofold improvement relative to the 10-gene data matrix generated from the identical set of taxa. We were able to significantly improve formicine classification based on our comprehensive UCE phylogeny. Our divergence age estimations, using both UCE and Sanger data, indicate that crown-group Formicinae are older (104-117 Ma) than previously suggested. Biogeographic analyses infer that the diversification of the subfamily has occurred on all continents with no particular hub of cladogenesis.  Conclusions:  We found UCEs to be far superior to the multi-locus data set in estimating formicine relationships. The early history of the clade remains uncertain due to ancient rapid divergence events that are unresolvable even with our genomic-scale data, although this might be largely an effect of several problematic taxa subtended by long branches. Our comparison of divergence ages from both Sanger and UCE data demonstrates the effectiveness of UCEs for dating analyses. This comparative study highlights both the promise and limitations of UCEs for insect phylogenomics, and will prove useful to the growing number of evolutionary biologists considering the transition from Sanger to next-generation sequencing approaches.

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are becoming more prevalent due to the rise of global trade and expansion of urban areas. Ants are among the most prolific invaders with many exhibiting a multiqueen colony structure, dependent colony foundation and reduced internest aggression. Although these characteristics are generally associated with the invasions of exotic ants, they may also facilitate the spread of native ants into novel habitats. Native to diverse habitats across North America, the odorous house ant Tapinoma sessile has become abundant in urban environments throughout the United States. Natural colonies typically have a small workforce, inhabit a single nest, and are headed by a single queen, whereas urban colonies tend to be several orders of magnitude larger, inhabit multiple nests (i.e., polydomy) and are headed by multiple queens (i.e., polygyny). Here, we explore and compare the population genetic and breeding structure of T. sessile within and between urban and natural environments in several localities across its distribution range. We found the social structure of a colony to be a plastic trait in both habitats, although extreme polygyny was confined to urban habitats. Additionally, polydomous colonies were only present in urban habitats, suggesting T. sessile can only achieve supercoloniality within urbanized areas. Finally, we identified strong differentiation between urban and natural populations in each locality and continent\u0010wide, indicating cities may restrict gene flow and exert intense selection pressure. Overall, our study highlights urbanization's influence in charting the evolutionary course for species.",

Argentine ants were common in coastal sage scrub habitat within 250 m of urban edges, but rare in interior areas.  Correspondingly, native ants were significantly less abundant & diverse in edge areas as compared to interior.  Over the period 1997-2000, Argentine ants did not become more abundant in interior habitat, suggesting it will remain a refuge for native ants.  Argentine ant abundance in edge plots varied greatly among years & sites.  Annual variation in abundance was positively related to annual rainfall.  Increased soil moisture near edges due to urban runoff has often been suggested as the mechanism that allows the invasion of edge, but not interior habitat.  This hypothesis predicts that edge habitat downslope of the urban edge should support invasions of higher abundance & greater spatial penetration than habitat upslope.  However, I found that edge slope did not predict the extent of invasion, whereas, soil type did.  Coarse, well-drained soils supported an Argentine ant invasion of lower abundance & lesser spatial penetration than soils that should retain more moisture.  These patterns of spatial & annual variation are more consistent with a biotic flow mechanism, where ants move from urban habitat into coastal sage scrub sites that are temporarily favorable, rather than an abiotic flow where urban runoff causes a physical change to coastal sage scrub habitat near edges.  This invasion affects a substantial area of habitat, however, the inability of Argentine ants to invade interior habitat suggests that refugia for native ants will persist if large unfragmented blocks of habitat are maintained.]",

    "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation and invasive species often contribute to the decline of native taxa. Since the penetration of non-native species into natural habitat may be facilitated by habitat fragmentation, it is important to examine how these two factors interact. Previous research documented that, in contrast to most other arthropod taxa, spiders increased in density and morphospecies richness with decreasing fragment area and increasing fragment age (time since insularization) in urban habitat fragments in San Diego County, California, USA. We tested whether a specific mechanism, an increase in non-native species with fragmentation, is responsible for this pattern. We found that both native and non-native taxa contributed to the pattern. Abundance of native spiders per pitfall trap sample increased significantly with decreasing fragment size (i.e. a negative density-area relationship) and abundance of non-natives increased significantly with increasing fragment age. The proportion of non-native individuals also increased significantly with age. One non-native species, Oecobius navus, comprised the majority of non-native individuals (82.2%) and a significant proportion of total individuals (25.1%). Richness of spider families per sample (family density) increased with fragment age due to an increase in the occurrence of non-natives in older fragments, however, native family richness did not vary with age or area. Due to increasing dominance by non-native and some native families, family evenness declined with decreasing fragment size and increasing fragment age. Native and non-native abundance covaried positively arguing against strong negative interactions between the two groups. O. navus had a strong positive association with another common non-native arthropod, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), suggesting a possible direct interaction. In contrast, abundance of native spiders was negatively correlated with Argentine ant abundance. We hypothesize that fragmentation in this semiarid habitat increases productivity in smaller and older fragments enhancing the density of both native and non-native taxa.",

    "abstract": "*[The distribution of non-ant arthropods was examined in 40 urban habitat fragments in coastal San Diego County, California, USA, to look for effects of fragmentation, proximity to developed edge, and the non-native Argentine ant (Linepithema humile).  Arthropods were sampled with pitfall traps and by vacuum sampling from California buckwheat shrubs (Eriogonum fasciculatum).  Individual arthropods were identified to order & Recognizable Taxonomic Unit (RTU), or morphospecies.  At the fragment scale, we looked for correlations in the point diversity & abundance of arthropods as a function of the age & area of the fragment being sampled.  At the scale of the individual sample points, we looked for correlations of abundance & diversity with variables that describe the species composition of the shrub vegetation & disturbance.  As indicators of disturbance, we used the cover of native woody & exotic non-woody vegetation, the distance to the nearest developed edge, & the abundance of Argentine ants.  In general, arthropods showed a fragmentation effect with point diversity & abundance positively correlated with fragment area & negatively correlated with fragment age.  The pitfall samples were dominated by 2 primarily non-native orders, Isopoda, Dermaptera, & Blattaria.  Over 35% of all pitfall-captured arthropods belonged to 4 species in these orders.  Dermaptera & Blattaria increased in abundance in smaller & older fragments, respectively.  Isopod abundance, in contrast, was unrelated to fragment attributes.  None of these groups appeared to be associated with edges, but were distributed throughout the fragments.  Point diversity & abundance in ground-active spiders appears to be enhanced by fragmentation.  Total pitfall RTU richness & abundance, & abundance or richness in the Coleoptera (vacuum), Diptera, non-ant Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Microcoryphia, & Acarina had significant partial negative correlations with Argentine ant abundance.  The Diptera and Coleoptera had this negative partial relationship with the Argentine ants despite the fact that both they & the ants were positively associated with edges.  In general, diversity in most orders was higher in sampling locations dominated by coastal sage scrub habitat than in those with appreciable cover of chaparral shrub species.  There was a strong seasonal variation in abundance & diversity in most orders.  Diversity & abundance were highest in spring, intermediate in winter, & lowest in the fall.  Although higher trophic levels are often considered to be more sensitive to fragmentation, 2 groups of arthropod predators, spiders, & carabid beetles, increased in abundance in older fragments.  Abundance of these predators was positively correlated with the abundance of Argentine ants & the non-native Isopods, Dermaptera, & Blattaria.]",

    "abstract": "*[In this thesis, I study the patterns & processes driving ant diversity over a gradation of geographic levels.  Chapter 1 compares & describes the density & dispersion of nut-nesting ants in SE US temperate deciduous forests under nut producing trees.  Species diversity & nut occupancy rates do not differ among sites or states & ant-occupied nuts are spatially aggregated across ant species, a pattern inconsistent with spatial segregation of species that might arise in a competition-assembled community.  In Chapter 2, through the development of new rapid sampling methods, I determine Strumigenys ant communities are feasible to study.  I found 0.20 ha habitats & 1.0 m2 microsites are appropriate spatial scales for investigating abiotic factors & general habitat characteristics important for Strumigenys communities.  I concluded that an even finer scale (< 1.0 m2) would be necessary to investigate community patterns on spatial scales on which Strumigenys are likely to interact or compete.  Chapter 3 focuses on broad scale diversity patterns & describes the biogeographic origins of Nearctic Strumigenys.  I produce a molecular based phylogeny to describe phylogenetic relationships of species & infer likely biogeographic histories of Nearctic species.  I tested 2 alternative hypotheses for the assembly of biogeographic patterns in Nearctic Strumigenys, the adaptive radiation hypothesis verses the evolutionary conservatism hypothesis.  Ranges of migrant or introduced species within the U.S. are consistent with average annual temperature and rainfall of ranges, they occupy outside of the U.S.  Results of climate & phylogenetic comparisons support predictions of the evolutionary conservatism hypothesis.  Chapter 4 examines patterns & processes in the ant genus Strumigenys.  I examined the phylogenetic & trait relationships of co-occurring Strumigenys species at very small to very large geographic spatial scales to test predictions of a competition hypothesis against 3 alternative community assembly hypotheses.  The largest geographic scale included 60,000km2 bioregions across North America North of Mexico, to southeastern U.S. local communities of 2000m2, 25m2, & 0.1m2 microsites.  Patterns of biodiversity of Strumigenys differed as a function of scale & suggested processes are differentially important depending on the geographic scale of pattern investigation.  There was no evidence that competition had influenced assemblage patterns of Strumigenys communities at any geographic scale.]",

    "abstract": "The generic classification of the ant subfamily Dorylinae is revised, with the aim of facilitating identification of easily-diagnosable monophyletic genera. The new classification is based on recent molecular phylogenetic evidence and a critical reappraisal of doryline morphology. New keys and diagnoses based on workers and males are provided, along with reviews of natural history and phylogenetic relationships, distribution maps, and a list of valid species for each lineage. Twenty-eight genera (27 extant and 1 extinct) are recognized within the subfamily, an increase from 20 in the previous classification scheme. Species classified in the polyphyletic Cerapachys and Sphinctomyrmex prior to this publication are here distributed among 9 and 3 different genera, respectively. Amyrmex and Asphinctanilloides are synonymized under Leptanilloides and the currently recognized subgenera are synonymized for Dorylus . No tribal classification is proposed for the subfamily, but several apparently monophyletic genus-groups are discussed. Valid generic names recognized here include: Acanthostichus (= Ctenopyga), Aenictogiton, Aenictus (= Paraenictus, Typhlatta), Cerapachys (= Ceratopachys), Cheliomyrmex, Chrysapace gen. rev., Cylindromyrmex (= Holcoponera , Hypocylindromyrmex , Metacylindromyrmex), Dorylus (= Alaopone syn. n., Anomma syn. n., Cosmaecetes, Dichthadia syn. n., Rhogmus syn. n., Shuckardia, Sphecomyrmex, Sphegomyrmex, Typhlopone syn. n.), Eburopone gen. n., Eciton (= Camptognatha, Holopone, Mayromyrmex), Eusphinctus gen. rev., Labidus (= Nycteresia , Pseudodichthadia), Leptanilloides (= Amyrmex syn. n., Asphinctanilloides syn. n.), Lioponera gen. rev.

However, the life history transitions associated with the evolution of social parasitism in this genus are largely unexplored. To test competing hypotheses regarding the origins and evolution of social parasitism, we reconstructed a global phylogeny of Formica ants. The genus originated in the Old World ~30 Ma ago and dispersed multiple times to the New World and back. Within Formica, obligate dependent colony-founding behavior arose once from a facultatively polygynous common ancestor practicing independent and facultative dependent colony foundation. Temporary social parasitism likely preceded or arose concurrently with obligate dependent colony founding, and dulotic social parasitism evolved once within the obligate dependent colony-founding clade. Permanent social parasitism evolved twice from temporary social parasitic ancestors that rarely practiced colony budding, demonstrating that obligate social parasitism can originate from a facultative parasitic background in socially polymorphic organisms. In contrast to permanently socially parasitic ants in other genera, the high parasite diversity in Formica likely originated via allopatric speciation, highlighting the diversity of convergent evolutionary trajectories resulting in nearly identical parasitic life history syndromes.]",

    "abstract": "Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) are a highly invasive species that pose a serious threat to ecologically intact systems worldwide.  Their aggressive interspecies interactions may be linked to observed declines in the diversity and abundance a wide variety of invertebrate species inhabiting Argentine ant infested areas.  Pollination success and seed dispersal may be reduced as native invertebrate activity declines, with ensuing negative repercussions for native plant reproduction and ecological community composition. Argentine ants were first discovered on Santa Cruz Island, California in 1996 at two locations formally used by U.S. Navy contractors. Thereafter, Argentine ants established at two additional locations in the island\u0019s central watershed. The island managers, The Nature Conservancy and National Park Service, are beginning a treatment protocol in spring of 2012 targeting two of these infestations. We will treat one entire isolated infestation which encompasses five acres of scrub and oak vegetation. This complete site treatment will eliminate the common confounding variable of Argentine ant re-infestation from untreated edges, and will allow us to more precisely measure the efficacy of our protocol.  The second infestation site is 33 acres, but due to current state and federal permitting, we will treat only 10 acres in 2012.  Our treatment protocol consists of six applications of sucrose- attractant bait: two applications with S-methoprene and four applications spaced one month apart with thiamethoxam. Prior to each treatment we will conduct rigorous monitoring to detect ant activity at 65 stations in both the treatment and control sites. Data from the trial in 2012 will be submitted to state and federal regulatory agencies. In 2013 we plan to treat both infestations in their entirety. Island managers are also working with other landowners, such as the US Navy, to implement this protocol in other Channel Islands containing isolated Argentine ant infestations.

    "abstract": "Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) have invaded many areas of conservation concern, including half of the California Channel Islands. On Santa Cruz Island, the species has invaded approximately 2% of the island, and the infestations are expanding. Argentine ants displace many other invertebrates, and their expansion throughout the island could lead to the extirpation of native invertebrate species and the disruption of key ecological processes (e.g., plant-pollinator interactions and seed dispersal). We describe a treatment protocol to manage or eliminate Argentine ants on Santa Cruz Island developed by The Nature Conservancy and the National Park Service, in collaboration with academic and pest control specialists. We combined low-concentration toxicant baits with efficient dispersal methods to treat landscape-scale Argentine ant infestations in rugged terrain and dense vegetation with minimal impact to nontarget species. From May to October 2012, we applied our baiting protocol within 2 study sites, totaling 7.8 ha on Santa Cruz Island. In May 2013, one year post treatment, we observed >99% reduction in Argentine ant activity in treatment plots compared to untreated plots, using 2 different monitoring techniques. While further testing and monitoring is needed, these results suggest this protocol may be an effective tool to eliminate Argentine ant infestations from this type of habitat and terrain.

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is a widespread, abundant and ecologically disruptive invader that is present throughout major portions of coastal California and on half of the California Channel Islands. On Santa Cruz Island, the Argentine ant had invaded about 2% of the island's area in four distinct locations as of 2012. Given the negative ecological effects resulting from Argentine ant invasions, we sought to develop a cost\u0010effective method of eradication. Here, we describe the results of large\u0010scale, field\u0010tested methods for Argentine ant eradication and post\u0010treatment detection. Our eradication protocol employs a novel toxicant\u0010delivery system: an aqueous solution of sucrose and 6 ppm of thiamethoxam mixed with hydrating polyacrylamide beads. Ants feed on the solution present on the bead's surface for about 24 h after which time bead dehydration prevents feeding. We distributed hydrated beads by helicopter over 74 ha of infested areas plus a 50\u0010m buffer on 14 occasions between June 2013 and September 2014. Treatments reduced Argentine ant activity to subdetectable levels within four months. In 2014, we conducted a high\u0010intensity detection protocol using lures (n = 55 363) in areas treated in 2013. This effort did not detect Argentine ants. In 2015, we conducted a medium\u0010intensity detection protocol using lures (n = 2250) in areas treated in 2013 and 2014 but not searched in 2014; this sampling effort did not detect Argentine ant activity except for a single remnant infestation (c. 0.3 ha in area), which was retreated in 2015. The cost of treatments was approximately $1400 per ha; this cost is comparable to other ant eradication efforts. The cost of our preferred detection method, which used lures spaced every 10 m, was $500 per ha. These results demonstrate sufficient protocol efficacy to justify expansion of treatments to other infested areas in ecologically sensitive areas.

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is a widespread and abundant introduced species that disrupts ecosystems throughout its introduced range. This invader was inadvertently introduced to Santa Catalina, San Clemente, Santa Cruz, and San Nicolas Islands at various points during the past century but currently appears to be absent from the remaining Channel Islands. Multiple spatially disjunct infestations on each invaded island individually range in size from <500 m≤ to >427 ha and encompass a variety of habitats, including large areas that are entirely dominated by native perennial vegetation. The existence of multiple infestations on individual islands suggests that inadvertent introduction by humans serves as an important within-island dispersal mechanism. Multiyear surveys of individual infestations on San Clemente Island and Santa Cruz Island reveal approximately radial patterns of expansion (as a result of colony budding) away from the edge of each infestation. Rates of spread by budding on San Clemente Island range from 10 m/year to 57 m/year and are comparable to those on mainland California. Given the documented effects of Argentine ant invasions on Santa Cruz Island, the continued spread of the Argentine ant on the Channel Islands represents a serious environmental concern. Eradication programs underway on San Clemente and Santa Cruz Islands will hopefully result in island-wide elimination of this detrimental invader.

    "abstract": "*[We integrate morphology & molecular data to holistically address the evolution, classification, & identification of the ant genus Lasius, its tribe Lasiini, & their subfamily Formicinae.  We find that the crown Lasiini originated around the end of the Cretaceous on the Eurasian continent & is divisible into 4 morphologically distinct clades: Cladomyrma, the Lasius genus group, the Prenolepis genus group, & a previously undetected lineage we name Metalasius gen.nov., with one extant species M. myrmidon comb.nov. & one fossil species,  M. pumilus comb.nov.  The crown of the Lasius genus group is considerably younger than that of the Prenolepis genus group, indicating that extinction has played a major role in the evolution of the former clade.  Lasius itself is divided into 2 well-supported monophyletic groups, which are approximately equally speciose.  We present evidence that temporary social parasitism & fungiculture arose twice independently in Lasius.  In addition, we recover the paraphyly of 3 Lasius subgenera & propose replacing all subgenera with an informal species group classification: Lasius = Acanthomyops syn.rev., = Austrolasius syn.nov., = Cautolasius syn.nov., = Chthonolasius syn.nov., = Dendrolasius syn.nov.  Total-evidence analysis reveals that the Baltic-region amber fossil species  Lasius pumilus &   are misplaced to genus; we, therefore, create Sussuido gen.nov. to accomodate  S. boreus comb.nov. & transfer  L. pumilus to Metalasius.  Further, we transfer  Sussudio &  Glaphyromyrmex out of the Lasiini, considering the former to be incertae sedis in the subfamily, & the latter a member of the Formicini (tribal transfer).  Two final taxonomic actions are deemed necessary: synonymy of Lasius escamole with Liometopum apiculatum syn.nov. (subfamilial transfer), & transfer of Paratrechina kohli to Anoplolepis (tribal transfer, forming A. kohli comb.nov.).]",

To date, no one has examined the mechanism behind this complex 'ant effect'. In this study, we employed a 2 X 2 complete factorial design (water X food) in the field to mimic the effects of harvester ant nests (Messor andrei) on soil. We hypothesized that, in the absence of ants, addition of moisture and food (seeds and insects) would interact to produce conditions found in ant nests. Our results indicated that the addition of food to the soil (regardless of water addition) best mimicked the conditions found inside M. andrei nests. Both food-treated and ant-nest soils supported higher numbers of bacteria, nematodes, miscellaneous eukaryotes, and microarthropods compared to the other soil treatments. Microbial richness was also highest in ant and food-treated samples. Moreover, the ant effect in our experiment occurred in just two months. Because ants are a widespread, abundant group with many long-lived species, they could substantially influence soil properties and belowground food webs and may have important restoration/conservation implications for terrestrial communities.",

In addition, we analyzed the relationship between three numerically dominant ant species and overall ant species richness and abundance. We used pitfall traps to collect worker ants at 80 sites over a 2-wk period in May 2002. Twenty species of ants were identified from a total of 5,149 worker ants; 80% of all individuals belonged to three dominant species: Messor andrei (Mayr), Pheidole californica Mayr, and Solenopsis xyloni McCook. Ant species richness was negatively affected by grazing on nonserpentine soils only. In general, soil chemistry and texture formed the most consistent associations with the ant community. Plants were less important than soil attributes in explaining variation in overall ant species richness and abundance, but the abundance of the three dominant ant species was significantly correlated with plant biomass or plant richness. Based on logistic regression analysis, the presence or absence of each dominant ant species was negatively correlated with the abundance of the other two dominants. However, the three numerically dominant ant species did not correlate with overall ant species richness or abundance.",

The major soil groups (bacteria, fungi, nematodes, miscellaneous eukaryotes, and microarthropods) were quantified. All soil groups examined were more abundant and diverse in ant nests than in non-ant soil, and all soil nutrients were similarly enriched inside nests. A principal component analysis indicated that the enrichment of bacteria and fungi inside ant nests explained the majority of variation in the other response variables. Thus, it appears that M. andrei performs some activity and/or enriches one or more nutrients (e.g. phosphorous), which heavily impacts the base of the soil foodweb (bacteria and fungi). This suggests that these ant nests exert significant effects on the resident soil biota via bottom-up processes.",

This study documents dispersal of the elaiosome-bearing seeds of Fremontodendron decumbens by the harvester ant Messor (= Veromessor) andrei.  Seeds were released from capsules over a period of ca. 2 mo during the summer, but the timing of release varied between years.  Ants were strongly attracted to the elaiosome portion of diaspores rather than the seed portion, & carried elaiosome-bearing seeds up to 12 m from F. decumbens shrubs.  Because ant nests never occurred under shrub canopies, seeds were transported from beneath parent shrubs to nests located in gaps in the existing shrub cover.  Some seeds (at least 5%) that were taken into ant nests were apparently consumed by ants, 45% were ejected intact & left on nest middens within 65 cm of nest entrances, & the remainder were not found & may have remained within the nests.  The seed coat of F. decumbens was greatly (3-fold) thickened near the elaiosome, suggesting an adaptation to discourage ants from consuming seeds.  Elaiosomes contained little moisture, but significant amounts of fat, protein, & carbohydrates.  Each elaiosome contained 8.8% of the total energy content of a diaspore.  In energetic terms, the cost to F. decumbens of building elaiosomes was relatively small (an 8% reduction in seed output).  Elaiosomes also were consumed by small invertebrates & decomposers, so that elaiosomes were absent from diaspores after 2 mo in the litter layer.]",

Prior research showed that its elaiosome-bearing seeds are dispersed by the harvester ant Messor andrei. I tested several hypotheses regarding the positive role of ant-mediated dispersal to F. decumbens: (1) Does ant-mediated seed dispersal facilitate seed escape from rodent predation?; (2) Does ant processing of seeds stimulate germination?; (3) are ant middens more suitable microsites for seed or seedling survival in unburned chaparral areas?; and (4) do survival benefits of dispersal occur post-fire in the form of differences in seedling survival probabilities and, if so, why? Results of tests of each hypothesis were: (1) similar percentages of seeds placed on ant middens and under F. decumbens shrub canopies were destroyed by rodents, but seeds from which elaiosomes had been removed were more likely to escape rodent predation; (2) seeds processed by ants did not germinate more readily than seeds removed directly from shrub branches; (3) seedling predation was a major cause of mortality in unburned chaparral on both ant middens and under shrubs, and overall seedling survival did not differ between the two microsites; (4) post-burn seedling survival was significantly greater for seedling dispersed away from F. decumbens shrub canopies, because dispersed seedlings were both less likely to be killed by predators and more likely to be growing in a gap created by the fire-caused death of an established shrub. I concluded that the major ecological benefit to F. decumbens of ant-mediated seed dispersal was elevated post-fire seedling survival resulting from enhanced escape by dispersed seedlings from both predation and competition.",

    "abstract": "The genus Stenamma Westwood comprises a group of cryptic, cold tolerant ants that occur throughout the Holarctic and Middle American regions. Traditional approaches to taxonomy and phylogeny are confounded by multiple factors, including the conservative and often convergent morphology of workers and the rarity of reproductive castes in collections. Monophyly of Stenamma and relationships within the genus are uncertain as nearly all previous taxonomic work has been regional in scope. Furthermore, the sister group to Stenamma has not been well established. Here an extensive molecular dataset consisting of ten genes (~8 kb of data), 48 ingroup taxa (20 Nearctic, 6 Palaearctic and 22 Neotropical) and 8 outgroup taxa (6 closely related non-Stenamma and 2 additional myrmicines) is used to investigate the broad-scale phylogeny and evolutionary history of Stenamma. Phylogenetic analysis is performed under maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks on individual genes and several alternate concatenated datasets, which are used to investigate the effects of inclusion or exclusion of COI and intronic regions. The timing of Stenamma evolution is inferred in beast and ancestral areas are reconstructed using both the s-diva and DEC methods, as implemented in the programs rasp and lagrange, respectively. Stenamma is revealed as monophyletic with high support and tentatively is sister to a group of New World species placed currently in Aphaenogaster Mayr and Messor Forel. Within Stenamma, two major clades are recovered: a 'Holarctic clade' (HOC) and a 'Middle American clade' (MAC). The HOC consists of the European S. striatulum Emery sister to two well-supported groups, the informal 'debile' and 'brevicorne' clades. The 'brevicorne' clade is entirely Nearctic, whereas the 'debile' clade includes both Nearctic and Palaearctic representatives. The MAC occurs from the southern United States to northern South America and, with the exception of S. huachucanum Smith, is almost completely isolated geographically from the HOC. It includes a depauperate northern clade and the 'MAC core', which is a diverse assemblage of wet forest adapted species found throughout Central America. Divergence dating and biogeographic reconstruction show that Stenamma is most likely to have originated in the Nearctic at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (~35 Ma) and diversified more rapidly at 16 and 8 Ma for the HOC and MAC, respectively. Potential environmental factors affecting the evolution of Stenamma include the intense global cooling of the late Eocene combined with aridification and mountain building. The phylogenetic results are discussed in relation to the current Stenamma species groups and several new morphological characters are presented to help in identification.",

    "abstract": "Aim:  The standard latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), in which species richness decreases from equator to pole, is a pervasive pattern observed in most organisms. Some lineages, however, exhibit inverse LDGs. Seemingly problematic, documenting and studying contrarian groups can advance understanding of LDGs generally. Here, we identify one such contrarian clade and use a historical approach to evaluate alternative hypotheses that might explain the group's atypical diversity pattern. We focus on the biogeographical conservatism hypothesis (BCH) and the diversification rate hypothesis (DRH).  Location:  Global.  Taxon:  Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Stenammini).  Methods:  We examined the shape of the LDG in Stenammini by plotting latitudinal midpoints for all extant, described species. We inferred a robust genome-scale phylogeny using UCE data. We estimated divergence dates using beast2 and tested several biogeographical models in BioGeoBEARS. To examine diversification rates and test for a correlation between rate and latitude, we used the programs BAMM and STRAPP, respectively.  Results:  Stenammini has a skewed inverse LDG with a richness peak in the northern temperate zone. Phylogenomic analyses revealed five major clades and several instances of non-monophyly among genera (Goniomma, Aphaenogaster). Stenammini and all its major lineages arose in the northern temperate zone. The tribe originated ~51 Ma during a climatic optimum and then diversified and dispersed southward as global climate cooled. Stenammini invaded the tropics at least seven times, but these events occurred more recently and were not linked with increased diversification. There is evidence for a diversification rate increase in Holarctic Aphaenogaster + Messor, but we found no significant correlation between latitude and diversification rate generally.  Main Conclusions:  Our results largely support the BCH as an explanation for the inverse latitudinal gradient in Stenammini. The clade originated in the Holarctic and likely became more diverse there due to center-of-origin, time-for-speciation and niche conservatism effects, rather than latitudinal differences in diversification rate.

    "abstract": "The morphology of organisms relates to most aspects of their life history and autecology. As such, elucidating the drivers of morphological variation along environmental gradients might give insight into processes limiting species distributions. In eusocial organisms, the concept of morphology is more complex than in solitary organisms. Eusocial insects such as ants exhibit drastic morphological differences between reproductive and worker castes. How environmental selection operates on the morphology of each caste, and whether caste\u0010specific selection has fitness consequences is largely unknown, but is potentially crucial to understand what limits ant species' distributions. Here we aimed to examine whether ant shape and body size covaries with climate at the scale of an entire continent, and whether such relationship might be caste specific. We used 26,472 georeferenced morphometric measurements from 2,206 individual ants belonging to 32 closely related North American species in the genus Formica to assess how ant morphology relates to geographic variation in the abiotic environment. Although precipitation and seasonality explained some of the geographic variation in morphology, temperature was the best predictor. Specifically, geographic variation in body size was positively related to temperature, meaning that ants are smaller in cold than in warm environments. Moreover, the strength of the relationship between size and temperature was stronger for the reproductive castes (i.e. queens and males) than for the worker caste. The shape of workers and males also varied along these large\u0010scale abiotic gradients. Specifically, the relative length of workers' legs, thoraxes and antennae positively related to temperature, meaning that they had shorter appendages in cold environments. In contrast, males had smaller heads, but larger thoraxes in more seasonal environments. Overall, our results suggest that geographic variation in ambient temperature influences the morphology of ants, but that the strength of this effect is caste specific. In conclusion, whereas ant ecology has traditionally focused on workers, our study shows that considering the ecology of the reproductive castes is imperative to move forward in this field.",

We found significant effects that were most pronounced within 300 m of the shore, but extended 3 km inland via coyote scat deposition. The zone within 300 m of the sea had a higher density of vegetation with a distinctly different plant composition. The denser vegetation supported higher abundances of birds and reptiles. Coyotes exhibited spatial and temporal responses to marine subsidies of fish, while birds were likely subsidized by aquatic aerial insects. Top-down control, as well as dietary and habitat preferences, may have resulted in reduced number of ants, beetles, and small mammals near the sea. Species responses to the habitat edge appeared to be associated with life history, as the near shore habitat favored habitat generalists and shore specialists, while inland desert habitat favored many sand and open desert specialists. Ecosystem responses support current theories of allochthonous spatial subsidies and consumer-resource dynamics but were limited in scope, magnitude, and distance.

We show that 5 Formica species exhibit homologous divergent haplotypes spanning 11 Mbp on chromosome 3.  Despite the supergene's size, only 142 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) consistently distinguish alternative supergene haplotypes across all 5 species.  These conserved trans-species SNPs are localized in a small number of disjunct clusters distributed across the supergene.  This unexpected pattern of divergence indicates that the Formica supergene does not follow standard models of sex chromosome evolution, in which distinct evolutionary strata reflect an expanding region of suppressed recombination.  We propose an alternative 'eroded strata model' in which clusters of conserved trans-species SNPs represent functionally important areas maintained by selection in the face of rare recombination between ancestral haplotypes.  The comparison of whole-genome sequences across 10 additional Formica species reveals that the most conserved region of the supergene contains a transcription factor essential for motor neuron development in Drosophila.  The discovery that a very small portion of this large & ancient supergene harbors conserved trans-species SNPs linked to colony social organization, suggests that the ancestral haplotypes have been eroded by recombination, with selection preserving differentiation at one or a few genes generating alternative social organization.]",

This study used observations of foraging and cafeteria-style experiments to test for seed species selection by the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus Emery (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in CSS. Analysis of foraging behavior showed that P. rugosus carried seeds of exotic Erodium cicutarium (L.) and exotic Brassica tournefortii (Gouan) on 85 and 15% of return trips to the nest (respectively), and only a very few ants carried the native seeds found within the study areas. When compared with the availability of seeds in the field, P. rugosus selected exotic E. cicutarium and avoided both native Encelia farinosa (Torrey & A. Gray) and exotic B. tournefortii. Foraging by P. rugosus had no major effect on the seed bank in the field. Cafeteria-style experiments confirmed that P. rugosus selected E. cicutarium over other available seeds. Native Eriogonum fasciculatum (Bentham) seeds were even less selected than E. farinosa and B. tournefortii.",

Seasonal patterns of host plant utilization & association with attendant ants were examined through bi-weekly censuses of the aphid population feeding on 30 ornamental oleander plants, Nerium oleander, in N California in 1985 & 1986.  Colonies occurred on both developing & senescing plant terminals, including leaf tips, floral structures, & pods.  Aphids preferentially colonized leaf terminals early in the season, but showed no preference for feeding site during later periods.  Argentine ants, Iridomyrmex humilis, occasionally tended aphid colonies.  Colonies on floral tips were 3 to 4 times more likely to attract ants than colonies on leaf tips, even though the latter frequently contained more aphids.  Ants showed a positive recruitment response to colonies on floral tips, with a significant correlation between colony size & number of ants.  There was no recruitment response to colonies on leaf tips.  These patterns were reproducible over 2 years despite large fluctuations in both aphid population density & ant activity.  In a laboratory bioassay of aphid palatability, the generalist predator, Hippodamia convergens, took significantly more aphids reared on floral tips compared to those reared on leaf tips.]",

Multiple parasitism may also be a synapotypy of these 2 genera, but too little data on other phorid life histories are available to polarize this character state correctly.

Bait experiments showed that colonies can recruit to high-density patches of seeds.  However, at the seasonal scale, natural resource distribution did not affect the distribution of foraging activity.  We conducted the study in years of high rainfall & thus seed availability may not have been a limiting factor.  Colonies always preferred to forage in areas closer to their nest, which may reduce travel time between the nest & foraging sites.  On a day-to-day scale, encounters between neighboring colonies at a site increased the probability that colonies would return to forage at that site.  This was true both for natural & experimental encounters.  In the summer, this resulted in colonies foraging at the sites of intraspecific encounters on more days, than in areas where no encounter had occurred.  Encounters between colonies included fighting, & there was little overlap between the foraging areas of neighboring colonies.  Both results suggest that one function of encounters is to defend foraging space.  The high probability of return to the site of an encounter between colonies suggests that encounters may have a second function, i.e., to indicate the presence of resources.]",

    "abstract": "A vast diversity of parasites associates with ants. Living in and around ant nests of these organisms must overcome ant colony defenses. As ant defensive behavior is mainly mediated by species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) or alarm pheromones, and ant-associated parasites can either crack their hosts\u0019 chemical communication code by modifying their own CHC profiles or use pro-active strategies like chemical weaponry for distraction and repellency. While the chemical nature of ant\u0013parasite interactions has been intensively studied for highly host-specific parasites, the chemical-deceptive strategies of the rather rare ant-resembling heteropterans are unknown. To gain insight into this system, I studied the bug Scolopostethus pacificus (Barber 1918) which can be found near the nests of the ecologically dominant and aggressive velvety tree ant (Liometopum occidentale, Emery 1895). Using behavioral, chemical, and molecular approaches, I disentangled the relationship of S. pacificus and its host ant. Chemical profiling of the bug and the ant revealed that the bug does not make use of CHC insignificance or mimicry, but instead uses a cocktail of volatile compounds released from its metathoracic glands that likely moderates encounters with its aggressive host. Feeding trials with armed and artificially disarmed bugs revealed a defensive function of the gland exudates. Targeted molecular gut barcoding showed that S. pacificus does not feed on L. occidentale. These results suggest that chemical weaponry, rather than a chemical code-cracking CHC matching or chemical insignificance, enables S. pacificus to get along with and live in close proximity to its host ant.",

The mechanisms by which Argentine ants effectively compete against native ant species have been previously addressed in field studies that centered on interference and exploitation competition at baits and mainly examined the colony-level performance of Argentine ants. Detailed behavioral observations explaining the basis for the strong competitive ability of L. humile are comparatively rare. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which Argentine ants displace native ants we examined the aggressive interactions between the Argentine ants and the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile in four different aggression assays: (1) worker dyad interactions, (2) symmetrical group interactions, (3) intruder introductions into an established resident colony, and (4) a resource competition assay which focused on competition for food and nesting space. Our results demonstrate a clear disparity between worker-level and colony-level fighting ability of Argentine ants and provide behavioral evidence to explain the superior interference ability of Argentine ants in group assays. Argentine ants experienced mixed success in fighting against odorous house ants in dyad interactions, but gradually gained a numerical advantage in symmetrical group interactions by active cooperation among nestmates. Results of the resource competition assay indicate that Argentine ants recruit rapidly, numerically dominate food and nesting sites, and aggressively displace T. sessile from baits. Taken together, the results of these assays allow us to pinpoint the behavioral mechanisms responsible for the remarkable competitive ability of Argentine ants.",

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is an invasive species that disrupts the balance of natural ecosystems by displacing indigenous ant species throughout its introduced range. Previous studies that examined the mechanisms by which Argentine ants attain ecological dominance showed that superior interference and exploitation competition are key to the successful displacement of native ant species. The objective of this research was to test the hypothesis that effective interference competition by Argentine ants may also be detrimental to the survival of Argentine ant colonies where Argentine ants and native ants compete at toxic baits used to slow the spread of Argentine ants. To study this hypothesis, we examined the competitive interactions between Argentine ants and native odorous house ants, Tapinoma sessile, in the presence and absence of toxic baits. Results showed that Argentine ants aggressively outcompete T. sessile from toxic baits through efficient interference competition and monopolize bait resources. This has severe negative consequences for the survival of Argentine ants as colonies succumb to the toxic effects of the bait. In turn, T. sessile avoid areas occupied by Argentine ants, give up baits, and consequently suffer minimal mortality. Our results provide experimental evidence that highly efficient interference competition may have negative consequences for Argentine ants in areas where toxic baits are used and may provide a basis for designing innovative management programs for Argentine ants. Such programs would have the double benefit of selectively eliminating the invasive species while simultaneously protecting native ants from the toxic effects of baits.",

When fed cockroaches, Argentine ants from both regions acquired additional amounts of Supella- & Blattella-specific hydrocarbons, with a significant increase in levels of Blattella-specific hydrocarbons.  Therefore, diet partitioning produced a greater change in the proportion of prey hydrocarbons in the California than in the southeastern U.S. populations, which may be responsible for the altered behavior observed in the California population.

To gain an understanding of mechanisms underlying nestmate recognition in the Argentine ant, I studied its population genetic structure and the role of genetic vs. environmental cues on aggression.  I combine behavioral, genetic, and analytical data to explore the role of exogenous cues and recent changes in the population genetic structure on nestmate recognition in this ant.  In Chapter II, I examined population genetic structure and intercolony aggression in 2 portions of the Argentine ant introduced range: California and the southeastern U.S.  I describe factors that may have contributed to the present-day differences in genetic diversity between these 2 regions and I also suggest ecological factors that may have contributed to regional differences in current distribution patterns of the Argentine ant.  In Chapter III, I examined the context-dependency of nestmate discrimination in the Argentine ant and the effect of action thresholds on exogenous cue recognition.  I also tested hypotheses that explain a change in action thresholds as well as factors that affect action thresholds.  I examined changes in intraspecific aggression in various discrimination contexts.  I tested the importance of isolated nest referents on aggression thresholds. In Chapter IV, I examined the impact of different diet-derived hydrocarbons on intraspecific aggression in the Argentine ant and the potential of shared, diet-derived hydrocarbons to produce colony uniformity where intercolony genetic and/or environmental differences exist.  In Chapter V, I examined the role of environmental cues on nestmate recognition in 2 populations of the Argentine ant.  I tested the hypothesis that there is geographical variation in the response of Argentine ants to nestmate recognition cues derived from prey.  In Appendix I, I use the Argentine ant to compare 4 aggression bioassays for consistency between replicates, similarity between assays, and ability to predict whole colony interactions.  I tested 4 different aggression assays with 2- or 3-scoring methods per assay.  I also determined whether isolated aggressive encounters could predict whole colony interactions.]",

    "abstract": "Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), the dominant fraction of the insects' epicuticle and the primary barrier to desiccation, form the basis for a wide range of chemical signaling systems. In eusocial insects, CHCs are key mediators of nestmate recognition, and colony identity appears to be maintained through a uniform CHC profile. In the unicolonial Argentine ant Linepithema humile, an unparalleled invasive expansion has led to vast supercolonies whose nestmates can still recognize each other across thousands of miles. CHC profiles are expected to display considerable variation as they adapt to fundamentally differing environmental conditions across the Argentine ant's expanded range, yet this variation would largely conflict with the vastly extended nestmate recognition based on CHC uniformity. To shed light on these seemingly contradictory selective pressures, we attempt to decipher which CHC classes enable adaptation to such a wide array of environmental conditions and contrast them with the overall CHC profile uniformity postulated to maintain nestmate recognition. n-Alkanes and n-alkenes showed the largest adaptability to environmental conditions most closely associated with desiccation, pointing at their function for water-proofing. Trimethyl alkanes, on the other hand, were reduced in environments associated with higher desiccation stress. However, CHC patterns correlated with environmental conditions were largely overriden when taking overall CHC variation across the expanded range of L. humile into account, resulting in conserved colony-specific CHC signatures. This delivers intriguing insights into the hierarchy of CHC functionality integrating both adaptation to a wide array of different climatic conditions and the maintenance of a universally accepted chemical profile.",

    "abstract": "AIM: In ectotherms, gradients of environmental temperature can regulate metabolism, development and ultimately fitness. The thermal adaptation hypothesis assumes that thermoregulation is costly and predicts that more thermally variable environments favour organisms with wider thermal ranges and thermal limits (i.e., critical thermal minima and maxima, CTòbô and CTòêì) which track environmental temperatures. We test the thermal adaptation hypothesis at two biological levels of organization, the community and species level. LOCATION: Continental USA. TIME PERIOD: May\u0013August 2016 and May\u0013August 2017. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Ants (Hymenoptera:Formicidae). METHODS: We used ramping assays to measure CTòêì and CTòbô for 132 species of North American ants across 31 communities spanning 15.7∞ of latitude. RESULTS: Ants were cold tolerant in cooler environments particularly at the community level where CTòbô was positively correlated with the maximum monthly temperature (CTòbô = 0.24Tòêì \u0012 0.4; R≤ = .39, p < .001). In contrast, most ant communities included some highly thermophilic species, with the result that CTòêì did not covary with environmental temperature means or extremes. Consequently, we found no evidence that thermally variable environments supported ant communities with broader thermal ranges. We found a strong phylogenetic signal in CTòêì but not CTòbô. Species level responses paralleled community data, where maximum monthly temperatures positively correlated with species CTòbô but not CTòêì, which was significantly lower in subterranean species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a large fraction of continental trait diversity in CTòêì and CTòbô can be found in a given ant community, with species with high CTòêì widely distributed regardless of environmental temperature. Species level analyses found the importance of local microclimate and seasonality in explaining thermal tolerances. Frequent invariance in CTòêì of insects at a large scale might be caused by (a) local adaptations to a site's microclimates and (b) species acclimation potential, both of which cannot be accounted for with mean annual temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Transitions in behavior across a continuous distribution of organisms can provide valuable information on how variation in behavior is maintained. We used analyses developed for interspecific hybrid zones to examine geographic variation in colony founding strategy in the desert seed-harvester ant, Messor pergandei. Newly mated females initiate new colonies either alone (haplometrosis) or cooperatively with other foundresses (pleometrosis). The incidence of these founding strategies were surveyed across the species' range and found to occur in geographically distinct regions joined by a narrow transition zone. Foundresses collected from haplometrotic sites were more likely to display aggression and found solitary nests than foundresses from pleometrotic sites, suggesting that geographical variation in metrosis is due to genotypic divergence. Foundresses from transitional sites were generally not aggressive and tended to co-found nests in the laboratory, yet rarely formed associations in the field. Such an abrupt shift in behavior indicates that variation in colony founding strategy is maintained by selection rather than the result of secondary contact of neutral characters. Level of aggression displays a wider cline than founding strategy and is likely under selection only when accompanied by active strategy preference.",

We conducted ant-exclusion experiments in order to determine the impact of ants on the infestation levels and parasitism of three of the most important citrus pests of western Mediterranean citrus: the honeydew producer Aleurothrixus floccosus Maskell (woolly whitefly) and the non-honeydew producers Aonidiella aurantii Maskell (California red scale; CRS) and Phyllocnistis citrella (Staiton) (citrus leafminer). The study was conducted in three commercial citrus orchards, each one dominated by one ant species (Pheidole pallidula, Lasius grandis or Linepithema humile) during two consecutive growing seasons (2011 and 2012). We registered a significant reduction of the CRS densities on fruits in the ant-excluded treatment in the three orchards and in the two seasons, ranging from as high as 41% to as low as 21%. Similarly, the percentage of shoots occupied by A. floccosus was significantly lower in the ant-excluded plots in the orchards dominated by P. pallidula and L. humile. No significant differences were registered in the percentage of leaf surface loss caused by P. citrella between ant-allowed and ant-excluded treatments in any case. We found no significant differences in the percent parasitism between ant-allowed and ant-excluded treatments for honeydew and non-honeydew producing herbivores. These results suggest that: (i) ant management should be considered in order to reduce herbivore populations in citrus and (ii) mechanisms other than parasitism (e.g., predation) might explain the differences in herbivore infestation levels between treatments.",

    "abstract": "*[In E Spain citrus, the most abundant & widespread ant species are the natives Lasius grandis Forel & Pheidole pallidula(Nylander), whereas the invasive Linepithema humile (Mayr) is also present but not widespread.  We have conducted ant-exclusion experiments in 3 commercial citrus orchards, each one dominated by one ant species (Pheidole pallidula, Lasius grandis or Linepithema humile) during 2 consecutive growing seasons (2011& 2012) with the aim to disentangle the ecological interactions with honeydew & non-honeydew producing pests & their natural enemies at the community-level.  We quantified the effect of the ant-exclusion on the infestation levels & parasitism of  3 of the most important citrus pests in the area, the honeydew producer Aleurothrixus floccosus (Maskell) (woolly whitefly) & the non-honeydew producers Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) (California red scale) & Phyllocnistis citrella (Stainton) (citrus leafminer).   California red scale densities on fruits were significantly lower in the 2 seasons & in the 3 orchards in the ant-excluded treatment.  Similarly, the percentage of shoots occupied by A. floccosus was significantly lower in the ant-excluded plots in the orchards dominated by P. pallidula & L. humile.  The percentage of leaf surface loss caused by P. citrella was similar on ant-allowed & ant-excluded treatments in the 3 orchards.  Interestingly, no significant differences were found in the percent parasitism between ant-allowed & ant-excluded treatments for the honeydew & non-honeydew producing herbivores.  These results suggest that factors other than parasitoid disruption might explain the increased pest populations observed in the presence of ants.  In the same orchards, we compared the abundance, species richness, diversity , & community structure of predators & parasitoids between the ant-allowed & ant-excluded treatments.  A total of 176,000 arthropods belonging to 81 taxa were captured & identified.   Regarding  abundance, the response of natural enemies to ant-exclusion was species specific.  When examining functional groups, parasitoids showed higher abundances in the ant-allowed treatment, whereas most generalist predators were less abundant.  The abundance of some species from the 4th trophic level (hyperparasitoids) also differed between treatments.  Similarly, the species richness & the Shannon diversity index of parasitoids were higher in the ant-allowed treatment, whereas the species richness of predators was significantly lower.  The community structure of predators & parasitoids was not significantly different between treatments.  Ants were not associated with a dramatic and/or general decrease in natural enemy abundance or biodiversity; on the contrary, we found higher parasitoid species richness & diversity in the presence of ants.  On the other hand, the negative impact of ants on generalist predators may have important implications for the regulation of pest populations.  Finally, we tested a novel hypothesis examining the potential competition between ants & natural enemies for honeydew produced by Hemiptera.  Through the use of high performance liquid chromatography, we related the level of ant activity with the energy reserves & feeding history of individual specimens collected in the field during representative days of spring, summer, & autumn.  Out of 145 Aphytis chrysomphali (Mercet) parasitoids, 65% were classified as sugar-fed & 24.7% as honeydew-fed.  A significant negative correlation between ant activity & the total sugar content &  honeydew feeding incidence by A. chrysomphali was found in summer, when ant activity peaked.  Out of 47 individuals of the predator Chrysoperla carnea s.l., 55.3% were classified as sugar-fed.  Ant activity was negatively correlated with the sugar feeding incidence by C. carnea in spring.  This is a previously undocumented indirect interaction in food webs in which ants interfere with the physiological state of the natural enemies.  Given that the absence of sugar feeding is detrimental to the fitness of many species of predators & parasitoids, this interaction may have important consequences for the arthropod community composition & practical implications for biological control.]",

    "abstract": "The Federal Imported Fire Ant Quarantine was implemented in 1958 and is cited in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 7, part 301.81 (7CFR301.81). The goal of the present day quarantine is to prevent the artificial spread of imported fire ants. Regulated items include nursery stock, grass sod, hay, soil and other items that can transport IFA. The current regulated area includes all or part of 14 states and Puerto Rico (AL, AR, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, NM, OK, SC, TN, TX, VA) and approximately 366 million acres. Numerous models indicate the potential range of the IFA is greater areas than those currently infested with IFA, primarily in the western states (OK, TX, NM, AZ and CA).  Since the late 1980's, the federal IFA quarantine program has been implemented by the states. States are responsible for inspecting nurseries, issuing compliance agreements, surveys, and conducting blitzes w/ USDA. Oversight of the program is by USDA-APHIS-PPQ and includes development of quarantine treatments, transfer of information to states and enforcement, including investigations and fines associated with violations.  Oversight and management of federal IFA quarantine program is a team effort of PPQ led by the National Program Manager (PPQ-EDP), with team members from PPQ-ER, PPQ-WR and PPQ-CPHST. The PPQ-CPHST Lab in Gulfport MS is responsible for the development of methods and tools used in the IFA Quarantine for survey, detection, regulation and control. The group oversees the APHIS Phorid fly (Pseudacteon spp.) rearing and release program (biological control of IFA). Florida Department of Agriculture, Division of Plant Industries (FL-DPI) mass rears the phorid flies and state cooperators conduct releases. ARS-CMAVE, Gainesville, FL develops the rearing techniques and transfers them to FL-DPI.  Recent accomplishments of the APHIS, PPQ IFA program included several new IFA quarantine treatments that have been developed and validated over the last few years with data from PPQ-CPHST, Tennessee State University and University of Arkansas. These include a new treatment for balled-and-burlapped nursery stock using a bifenthrin dip/immersion which is awaiting APHIS approval, and a new treatment for grass sod using bifenthrin also awaiting APHIS approval. In addition, APHIS has funded ARS to develop rapid an IFA identification field kit and trap, and a potential cold treatment for contaminated soils is under development with data from PPQ-CPHST and the University of Tennessee. To date, four species of phorid flies are in rearing and are being released. P. tricuspis and P. curvatus are established in more than 65% of the IFA quarantined area in the southern U.S. and releases of P. obtusus and P. cultellatus will continue through 2013. If no other phorids are available for rearing on red IFA, we will phase out the rearing and release program in 2013-2014. Special thanks to ARS-CMAVE (S. Porter), FL-DPI (G. Schneider) and all the state cooperators for making this program a success.  So, where is the APHIS-PPQ IFA Program going and what is changing?

    "abstract": "This study analyzes tropic relationships of the insect components of two intertidal salt march communities dominated by Salicornia pacifica and Spartina foliosa, respectively. Seasonality of that component is determined and influence of physical microenvironmental factors on trophic diversity is assessed. Adult insect populations were monitored weekly, trophic diversity was computed, and relationships with primary production and litter accumulation were quantified. Temporal diversity trends were similar in both communities although the amplitude was slightly greater in Salicornia. In both communities, herbivore diversity was highest during the spring months while saprovore diversity was highest during midwinter. Predator diversity responded to both herbivore and saprovore diversity, although it was more closely tied to herbivore fluctuations in Salicornia. Standing crop biomass was maximum during October and litter accumulation was highest during Janurary. Two classes of adult insects occurred: peristent species, representing a low percentage of the total species compliment, were present as adults throuhout the year in both marsh communities; seasonal species, on the other hand, were present as adults only during the growing season. Seasonal succession in species of herbivores and saprovores reflected productional and transformational changes in plant matter; predators responded likewise, but more impressive was the numerical response to prey populations by particular predators. Correlations were high between each trophic group and its respective resource. Physical microenvironmental factors, especially temperature and vapor pressure deficit, seemed to be important in cuing larval development, but did not exert a dramtic effect on adult diversity trends. Several strategies of habitat utilization are considered. It is hypothesized that the persistent and seasonal species have evolved as specialists to avoid competitive interactions and maximize resource utilization. During annual expansion of resource states, the salt marsh insect component undergoes speices packing wherein additional species enter the system temporarily to utilize the expanded resource base.          *[data on family level.]",

    "abstract": "Soil dwelling ants are important soil engineers that have a large impact on the soil ecosystem. This is reflected in the alteration of soil properties by ants due to burrowing activities, the accumulation of organic matter and other nutrients in the soil, which, in turn, alters soil physical, chemical and (micro) biological processes. A review of recent literature on these fine scale soil changes resulting from ant activity is presented in this paper. However, ants do not only affect soil properties at the fine scale but also have effects at the hillslope and catchment scales with respect to surface hydrological processes and ecosystem functioning. At the finest scale, most studies showed changed soil textures, lowered bulk densities and increased infiltration where ant burrows or mineral mounds are prominent. Only a few studies investigated the effects of ants on soil properties such as soil structure and aggregate stability, which were improved by ant activity. Nutrients were generally considered to be concentrated in nests, and increased nutrient cycling involving microbial processes were reported. On a broader scale, the information on nest densities and patterns is crucial to understand the impacts of ants, but this information is scarcely available. It has been reported that the activity of ants increases the heterogeneity of soil infiltration rates and nutrient concentrations at the landscape scale, which in turn has consequences for the redistribution of sediments and nutrients by geomorphological and biotic processes. A hierarchical descriptive model focusing on dry land ecosystems is presented to incorporate small-scale ant activity into broader scale hillslope and catchment processes. However, this model has to be tested and more research is needed, especially on these broader scale aspects, to be able to fully understand the role of ants on the ecosystem and landscape scale.",

Predation of seeds was high, but variable, across sites, suggesting that reduced dispersal could result in increased seed predation in some habitats.  Removal of elaiosomes did not affect the frequency with which predators removed seeds, but ants removed significantly more seeds with elaiosomes than without.  In behavior trials, only P. subnitidus was able to carry seeds of D. rigida effectively. L. humile and a small native ant species, D. insanus, while displaying interest in the diaspores, were seldom able to carry whole seeds and, when they did, only carried them a few centimeters.

    "abstract": "Large mammalian herbivores are well known to shape the structure and function of ecosystems world\u0010wide, and these effects can in turn cascade through systems to indirectly influence other animal species. A wealth of studies has explored the effects of large mammals on arthropods, but to date they have reported such widely varying results that generalizations have been elusive. Three factors are likely drivers of this variability: the widely varying life\u0010history characteristics of different arthropod groups, the highly variable landscapes that mammalian herbivores commonly inhabit and temporal variation in environmental conditions. Here, we use an 18\u0010year\u0010old exclosure experiment stratified across three distinct coastal prairie habitats in northern California to address the effects of a reintroduced mammalian herbivore, tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) on the composition, richness and abundance of ground\u0010dwelling arthropods over two years with very different precipitation regimes. We found that elk shifted the composition of arthropod communities, increasing the abundance of ants, beetles, spiders and mites, decreasing the abundance of woodlice and bristletails in some but not all habitats types, and having no effect on the abundance of bugs, crickets and springtails. Elk also increased richness and changed the composition of ant genera and beetle morpho\u0010species. Interestingly, the effects of elk on arthropod composition, richness and abundance varied little between years, despite very different precipitation levels, biomass accumulation and thatch height. Elk reduced shrub cover, above\u0010ground herbaceous biomass and thatch height and increased soil compaction, and these changes predicted the abundance and richness of arthropods, although taxonomic groups varied in their responses, presumably due to differences in environmental requirements. Synthesis. Our research highlights the importance of using long\u0010term experiments to assess the cascading effects of large herbivores on the composition of grounddwelling arthropod communities and to identify the mechanisms that indirectly shape arthropod responses to herbivores among variable habitats and years in order to develop a greater understanding of the variable responses of arthropods to large mammalian herbivores.",

    "abstract": "The native North American fire ants (Solenopsis Westwood) comprise a difficult group taxonomically that has undergone multiple revisions in the past century yet remains in a state of taxonomic uncertainty. In the present study, we utilised a set of 59 microsatellite markers analysed in 238 specimens to conduct the first robust genetic analysis of the four nominal species. Our approach used a variety of methods to test operational criteria commonly employed in species delimitation, including genotypic clustering, reproductive isolation/cohesion and monophyly. We conclude from our results that the recognised North American fire ant species represent evolutionarily independent entities and, moreover, we confirm the presumed sister status of the desert fire ants, S. aurea Wheeler and S. amblychila Wheeler. However, the presence of at least two genetically divergent populations within the nominal species boundaries, including a western form of S. xyloni and a distinct population of S. aurea endemic to the Salton Trough, suggests that the current taxonomy does not fully capture the species\u0010level diversity in this group. Our study provides the molecular foundation for future integrated studies of the taxonomy and evolution of this scientifically and economically important group of insects.

    "abstract": "One of the most conspicuous and stereotyped activities of social insects such as ants and honey bees is necrophoresis, the removal of dead colony members from the nest.  Previous researchers suggested that decomposition products such as fatty acids trigger necrophoric behavior by ant workers.  However, fatty acids elicit both foraging and necrophoric responses, depending on the current nest activities (e.g., feeding or nest maintenance).  Furthermore, workers often carry even freshly killed workers (dead for <1 h) to refuse piles before significant decomposition has a chance to occur.  Here, we show that the cuticular chemistry of Argentine ant workers, Linepithema humile, undergoes rapid changes after death.  When the workers are alive or freshly killed, relatively large amounts of 2 characteristic ant-produced compounds, dolichodial and iridomyrmecin, are present on the ants' cuticle.  However, these compounds disappear from the cuticle within about 1 h after death.  We demonstrate how this phenomenon supports an alternative mechanism of ant necrophoresis in which the precise recognition and rapid removal of dead nestmates are elicited by the disappearance of these chemical signals associated with life.",

    "abstract": "Here, we describe a novel method for the extraction of insect cuticular hydrocarbons using silica gel, herein referred to as \"silica-rubbing\". This method permits the selective sampling of external hydrocarbons from insect cuticle surfaces for subsequent analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The cuticular hydrocarbons are first adsorbed to silica gel particles by rubbing the cuticle of insect specimens with the materials, and then are subsequently eluted using organic solvents. We compared the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles that resulted from extractions using silica-rubbing and solvent-soaking methods in four ant and one bee species: Linepithema humile, Azteca instabilis, Camponotus floridanus, Pogonomyrmex barbatus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and Euglossa dilemma (Hymenoptera: Apidae). We also compared the hydrocarbon profiles of Euglossa dilemma obtained via silica-rubbing and solid phase microextraction (SPME). Comparison of hydrocarbon profiles obtained by different extraction methods indicates that silica rubbing selectively extracts the hydrocarbons that are present on the surface of the cuticular wax layer, without extracting hydrocarbons from internal glands and tissues. Due to its surface specificity, efficiency, and low cost, this new method may be useful for studying the biology of insect cuticular hydrocarbons.          *[Workers of A. instabilis were collected at the Finca Irlanda, Chiapas, Mexico in July 2010 (K.

Ants exposed to 20 and 40 ppm fipronil readily transferred the insecticide to other individuals in the colony, resulting in high mortality. Most of the transfer and subsequent mortality occurred within 4 d after exposure to treated ants. The other insecticides were not transferred, and ants exhibited mortality rates similar to that of the controls. Experiments in large foraging arenas demonstrated that necrophoresis was an important behavior facilitating the horizontal transfer of fipronil. When ants contacted contaminated corpses in the process of removing them to refuse piles, they received a lethal dose of fipronil and subsequently died. Fipronil-contaminated dead ants that were placed in the vicinity of the nest resulted in significantly higher mortality than did corpses placed in a distant foraging arena (30 cm away).

If impervious surfaces such as concrete are treated with these insecticides, the active ingredients can be washed from the surface by rain or irrigation. As a result, residual sprays with fipronil and pyrethroids are found in urban waterways and aquatic sediments. Given the amount of insecticides applied to urban settings for ant control and their possible impact on urban waterways, the development of alternative strategies is critical to decrease the overall amounts of insecticides applied, while still achieving effective control of target ant species. Herein we report a \u001cpheromone-assisted technique\u001d as an economically viable approach to maximize the efficacy of conventional sprays targeting the Argentine ant. By applying insecticide sprays supplemented with an attractive pheromone compound, (Z)-9-hexadecenal, Argentine ants were diverted from nearby trails and nest entrances and subsequently exposed to insecticide residues. Laboratory experiments with fipronil and bifenthrin sprays indicated that the overall kill of the insecticides on Argentine ant colonies was significantly improved (57\u0013142% increase) by incorporating (Z)-9-hexadecenal in the insecticide sprays. This technique, once it is successfully implemented in practical pest management programs, has the potential of providing maximum control efficacy with reduced amount of insecticides applied in the environment.",

    "abstract": "A novel bait station referred to as a virtual bait station was developed and tested against field populations of the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), at White Beach, Camp Pendleton, in Oceanside, CA. White Beach is a nesting habitat for an endangered seabird, the California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni Mearns). The beach is heavily infested with Argentine ants, one of the threats for the California least tern chicks. Conventional pest control strategies are prohibited because of the existence of the protected bird species and the site's proximity to the ocean. The bait station consisted of a polyvinyl chloride pipe that was treated on the inside with fipronil insecticide at low concentrations to obtain delayed toxicity against ants. The pipe was provisioned with an inverted bottle of 25% sucrose solution, then capped, and buried in the sand. Foraging ants crossed the treated surface to consume the sucrose solution. The delayed toxicity of fipronil deposits allowed the ants to continue foraging on the sucrose solution and to interact with their nestmates, killing them within 3-5 d after exposure. Further modification of the bait station design minimized the accumulation of dead ants in the sucrose solution, significantly improving the longevity and efficacy of the bait station. The virtual bait station exploits the foraging behavior of the ants and provides a low impact approach to control ants in environmentally sensitive habitats. It excluded all insects except ants, required only milligram quantities of toxicant, and eliminated the problem of formulating toxicants into aqueous sugar baits.",

An ant-exclusion experiment demonstrated greater seed predation levels of large-seeded species in invaded areas relative to uninvaded areas, but that predation of small-seeded taxa was unaffected by the invasion.  A second experiment demonstrated that the elimination of dispersers of large seeds from invaded areas explained these observed predation patterns.  Comparisons of seedling regeneration between invaded & uninvaded areas revealed a disproportionate reduction in the densities of large-seeded taxa, indicating that plant communities are changing in invaded areas.  To explore the mechanisms underlying recruitment declines, I used seed-cage experiments to examine how 4 components of seed dispersal by native ants-seed burial depth, elaiosome removal, seed clustering, & dispersal distance-influence the success of a large-seeded shrub, Leucospermum truncatulum.  In spite of costs, invasion by Argentine ants demonstrated the importance of seed burial by native ants for the persistence of many ant-dispersed taxa.]",

We compared social interactions, survival, & nest productivity of pairs containing queens from the cooperative founding population, the normally solitary founding population, or mixed pairs of the 2 types.  Expressed social phenotypes of queens in pairs depended strongly on the lineage of the other queen.  Two behaviors, aggression & brood care, showed simple social dynamical effects.  Aggression escalated in pairs of normally solitary queens, whereas queens in cooperative pairs coordinated brood output, leading to more efficient worker production.  These dynamics had context-based fitness consequences, such that cooperative queens gained a survival advantage in cooperative pairs, but neither type of queen experienced an advantage or disadvantage in 'mixed' associations.  The interplay between social dynamics & fitness in these associations provides an empirical example of social selection.  It captures a likely scenario of the transition to & the early evolution of cooperative living, in which cooperative individuals interact with solitary individuals, who lack a priori strategies for cooperation or cheating.]          Lay summary:Cooperation is assumed to benefit groups at cost to individuals, but comparisons of cooperative and solitary ant queens show that payoffs depend on who is in the group. Groups of cooperative queens coordinate to produce workers more efficiently, while normally solitary queens escalate aggression leading to their higher mortality. Importantly, solitary queens do not outcompete cooperative queens in mixed pairs, meaning populations with both strategies could co-exist at the transition to cooperative sociality.",

    "abstract": "The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the intramural research agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) which employs scientists to conduct basic and applied research for the development and transfer of solution to agricultural problems of high national priority and to ensure food security for domestic and export needs.  Economically important and invasive arthropods, especially insect, tick, and mite species, negatively impact the health of every plant and animal, resulting in significant production losses among crop, livestock and forestry commodities amounting to billions of US dollars annually.  The economic impact increases further when the insect damage to home and urban landscapes is taken into account.  Ensuring continued viability of beneficial insects in the environment is crucial for the pollination of all horticultural and orchard crops, as well as for enhancing natural biological control of pest arthropods and overall ecosystem sustainability.  Mitigating damage by arthropod pest species and safeguarding the health of beneficial arthropods are key components for ensuring the stability of agricultural production in the United States and abroad.  Developments in genomics, including next generation sequencing (NGS), provide a suite of new research tools within applied agricultural arthropod research.  Contributions by the ARS to arthropod genomics research are reviewed herein.  These  research approaches are discussed briefly in the context of improving agricultural production and environmental stewardship.  Arthropod genomics research within ARS is contributing significantly to the improvement of agricultural production and environmental stewardship for farmers, the agricultural industry, and consumers alike.

    "abstract": "The vine mealybug (VMB), Planococcus ficus, is a major grapevine pest worldwide, whose chemical control is often unsatisfactory due to its cryptic behavior, insecticide resistance and high fecundity rate. Recently, increasing restrictions have been applied to insecticides used for managing VMB. This review discusses sustainable VMB management strategies in organic viticulture. Pheromone-mediated mating disruption has been proved to be effective in both organic wine and table-grape vineyards. Biocontrol projects carried out through the release of parasitoids and/or predators have often provided inconclusive results, ranging from effective reduction of mealybug infestation to a marginal impact of parasitoids on VMB density. The latter outcome is likely due to constraints affecting the parasitoid activity, such as the disrupting activity of mealybug-tending ants and broad-spectrum insecticides, or untimely release of parasitoids. Ant suppression should be associated with the release of beneficial organisms, as mealybug-tending ants can severely affect the parasitoid activity. Cultural and physical control and the employment of entomopathogens and natural products mitigate the buildup of VMB populations, but they are not widely applied. VMB control in organic viticulture requires the integration of different strategies, as application of single control tools as a stand-alone treatment may not be effective, especially for high pest infestation. Future research to determine the density action threshold below which sustainable methods are effective and calibrate efforts in relation with pest infestation is needed. A multi-disciplinary approach is required to define the most appropriate sustainable control protocols in different environmental conditions and promote a further spread of organic viticulture.          *[In Table 2, Messor spp. & Tetramorium caespitum are incorrectly listed with Formicinae; they are Myrmicinae.]",

In an artificial nursery setting, colonies of Argentine ants were collected & introduced into the soil of potted oleander plants (Nerium oleander L.).  Plants were relocated into 12 field plots, that were subsequently treated with granular formulations of fipronil or bifenthrin, or left untreated.  Two or 3 days after treatment of artificial nurseries, the number of foraging ants was reduced 80% or more in all treated plots compared with controls.  Ant foraging rates in fipronil treated plots were reduced for about 3 wk after treatments & began to recover by week 4.  Bifenthrin treatments almost eliminated foraging ants for the duration of the trial.  The number of ants in control plots increased in the first 3 days after treatment, suggesting ants may have initially moved from treated plots to untreated areas.  In commercial nursery settings, similar sized plots contained plants naturally infested with L. humile of varying size colonies.  Plots were treated with a granular formulation of fipronil, or left untreated.  Trials in commercial nurseries showed a similar response in to fipronil treatments compared to the artificial nursery.  Fipronil granules were effective in significantly reducing ant foraging rates, but did not completely eliminate them from treated plots.  In both types of studies, it was difficult to space plots far enough apart so that treatments did not interfere with each other.  Fluctuations in control foraging rates indicated that ants were probably moving from plot to plot, during the course of the study.]",

Direct exposure to the plastic for as short as 1 min caused significant mortality of both red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, and Argentine ants, Linepithema humile (Mayr); however, red imported fire ants were more susceptible than Argentine ants. Knockdown of virtually all ants initially occurred within 15 min after exposure. However, some moribund ants recovered from the effects within 24 h. For example, after 1 min of direct exposure to the permethrin-impregnated plastic, 70% of Argentine ants and 5% of red imported fire ants recovered from the treatment. In established colonies of Argentine ants, significantly fewer ants foraged for food up posts treated with the plastic compared with untreated posts. In addition, colonies responded to introduction of the treatment by significantly reducing their overall foraging rates, even on untreated posts. When pots filled with moistened soil were introduced into established ant colonies, 82% of Argentine ants and 99% of red imported fire ants moved into the soil. In contrast, when a 1-cm-wide coil of the plastic was placed under the pot, no ants moved into the soil. The potential for use of these materials in nursery production is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Obscure mealybug is a pest of grapes in the cool climate regions of coastal California, is found on some vineyard weeds, and is tended by the Argentine ant. A study was conducted at a vineyard in Arroyo Grande, CA, to evaluate the impact of weeds on ant activity on grapevines, and the role that ants and weeds have on obscure mealybug infestation in grape clusters. The incidence of the fungus Botrytis cinerea was recorded as well. Treatments were weed exclusion versus the presence of weeds, and ant exclusion versus the presence of ants. Ant activity was evaluated weekly using sugar-based monitoring stations, and mealybug infestation and Botrytis incidence of clusters were evaluated at harvest. Ant exclusion reduced the overall number of ant visits by 82%, and ants increased mealybug infestation of clusters by 53%. Ant activity was 33% higher in the weeds treatment, but there was no impact of weeds on mealybug infestation. We suggest that the higher ant activity recorded in the weeds treatment may have been an artifact of the sugar-based sampling method. Botrytis incidence was three times higher with ants, but did not differ between weeds and weed exclusion treatments. The study supports other research showing a relationship between mealybug infestation and the presence of ants, as well as the lack of impact of floor vegetation on mealybug infestation of grape clusters. It is the first report of a relationship between ants and Botrytis, although it is more likely that the higher Botrytis incidence found here is a result of increased mealybug density than a direct effect by ants.",

We use data from a 28\u0010yr ongoing survey of a Northern California ant community invaded by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) to investigate the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on invasion dynamics. We found that the distribution of L. humile retracted following an extreme drought that occurred in the region from 2012 to 2015. The distribution of several native ant species also contracted, but overall native ant diversity was higher after the drought and for some native ant species, distributions expanded over the 28\u0010yr survey period. Using structural equation models, we found the strongest impact on the distribution of L. humile was from direct effects of climate, namely, cumulative precipitation and summer maximum temperatures, with only a negligible role for biotic resistance and indirect effects of climate mediated by native ants. The increasing drought and high temperature extremes projected for northern California because of anthropogenic\u0010driven climate change may limit the spread, and possibly the impact, of L. humile in invaded regions. The outcome will depend on the response of native ant communities to these climatic stressors.          *[In Table S1, Pseudomyrmex apache misspelled Pseudomyrex apache.

From Latitude 34' to Latitude 26', where they occur together, the rise in the upper elevational limit is 700 feet for albisetosus against 1300 feet for cockerelli.  Over the entire range of cockerelli the rise is almost 4000 feet.  In the northern part of the common range the upper elevational limit of cockerelli is approximately 1000 feet below that of albisetosus.  But because this limit rises more rapidly in the case of cockerelli, the 2 species have the same upper limit about Latitude 26'.  South of that latitude the upper limit of the vertical range of cockerelli continues to rise, but, since albisetosus does not occur south of Latitude 26', the records for cockerelli from stations above 6000 feet cannot properly be compared with those for albisetosus.  In the common range there is a considerable area of overlap in the vertical ranges of the 2 species.  The two vertical ranges are never identical, however, for although the upper limits may coincide, the lower limit of cockerelli always descends below that of albisetosus.

More interesting was the influence of ant-tending on parasitoid species relative abundance.  Primary parasitoids reared from S. oleae collected on coyote brush consisted of: Metaphycus helvolus, M. lounsburyi, M. anneckei, M. hageni, Coccophagus lycimnia, C. scutellaris, C. ochraceus, & the egg predator/parasitoid Scutellista caerulea.  However, that these parasitoid species did not distribute evenly between the ant-tended & ant-excluded treatments.

In 2003, liquid baits with small doses of imidacloprid, boric acid, or thiamethoxam dissolved in 25% sucrose water resulted in lower ant and mealybug densities and fruit damage, compared with an untreated control. Similar treatments in a soft scale-infested vineyard showed only a reduction of ant density and fruit infestation in only the boric acid and thiamethoxam treatments. In 2004, commercial and noncommercial formulations of liquid baits reduced ant densities in three separate trials, but they had inconsistent effects on mealybug densities and fruit infestation; granular protein bait had no effect. Using large plots and commercial application methodologies, liquid bait deployed in June resulted in lower ant density and fruit infestation, but it had no effect on mealybug density. Across all trials, liquid bait treatments resulted in lower ant density (12 of 14 trials) and fruit damage (11 of 14 sites), presenting the first report of liquid baits applied using commercial methodologies that resulted in a reduction of ants and their associated hemipteran crop damage. For commercialization of liquid baits, we showed that any of the tested insecticides can suppress Argentine ants when properly delivered in the crop system. For imidacloprid, bait dispensers must be protected from sunlight to reduce photodegradation. Results suggest that incomplete ant suppression can suppress mealybug densities. However, after ant populations are suppressed, there may be a longer period before hemipteran populations are effectively suppressed. Therefore, liquid baits should be considered part of a multiseason program rather than a direct, in-season control of hemipteran pest populations.",

A survey for parasitoids of P. viburni was conducted in the Edna Valley appellation wine grape region from 2005 to 2007, 6-8 years after classical biological control releases were discontinued. Two survey methods were used. First, field collections of obscure mealybugs from commercial vineyard blocks (2005-2007) and, second, placement of \"sentinel mealybugs\" on potted (1 L) grape vines (2006 only). From both survey methods, P. flavidulus was recovered, albeit levels of parasitism were low (less than 0.6%). We also placed longtailed mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni Tozzetti), on potted plants concurrent with placement of sentinel obscure mealybugs in the vineyard in order to measure parasitoid activity on this closely-related mealybug species. No P. flavidulus were recovered from P. longispinus. Other encyrtid parasitoids reared from either P. viburni or P. longispinus were Anagyrus pseudococci (Girault), Leptomastix dactylopii Howard, Leptomastidea abnormis (Girault), Coccidoxenoides perminutus Girault, and Tetracnemoidea peregrina (Compere). A hyperparasitoid, Chaetocerus sp., was also reared. The data are discussed with respect to biological control of vineyard mealybugs and newly developed controls for the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Because Pseudaphycus species reared from mealybugs are superficially very similar a taxonomic key and discussion of host relationships for selected Pseudaphycus species are provided.",

    "abstract": "1. The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, tends honeydew-excreting homopterans and can disrupt the activity of their natural enemies. This mutualism is often cited for increases in homopteran densities; however, the ant's impact on natural enemies may be only one of several effects of ant tending that alters insect densities. To test for the variable impacts of ants, mealybug and natural enemy densities were monitored on ant-tended and ant-excluded vines in two California vineyard regions. 2. Ant tending increased densities of the obscure mealybug, Pseudococcus viburni, and lowered densities of its encyrtid parasitoids Pseudaphycus flavidulus and Leptomastix epona. Differences in parasitoid recovery rates suggest that P. flavidulus was better able to forage on ant-tended vines than L. epona.  3. Densities of a coccinellid predator, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, were higher on ant-tended vines, where there were more mealybugs. Together with behavioral observations, the results showed that this predator can forage in patches of ant-tended mealybugs, and that it effectively mimics mealybugs to avoid disturbance by ants. 4. Ant tending increased densities of the grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus, by increasing the number of surviving first-instar mealybugs. Parasitoids were nearly absent from the vineyard infested with P. maritimus. Therefore, ants improved either mealybug habitat or fitness. 5. There was no difference in mealybug distribution or seasonal development patterns on ant-tended and ant-excluded vines, indicating that ants did not move mealybugs to better feeding locations or create a spatial refuge from natural enemies. 6. Results showed that while Argentine ants were clearly associated with increased mealybug densities, it is not a simple matter of disrupting natural enemies. Instead, ant tending includes benefits independent of the effect on natural enemies. Moreover, the effects on different natural enemy species varied, as some species thrive in the presence of ants.",

    "abstract": "In Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) forests, which once supported a frequent, mostly low severity fire regime, fire suppression has led to notable changes in forest structure and fuel loads. In parts of California, prescribed fire has been used to decrease fuel loads and reduce the risk of high intensity fire in these forests. Previous work has shown that circular litter-free clearings form around Jeffrey pine trees following prescribed burns and that they can reduce tree damage and potentially increase the chance of survival in a subsequent wildfire. In this study we aim to determine the factors responsible for maintaining clearings around trees after a fire occurs. Using a set of field experiments and observational studies, we show that a combination of natural processes, including reduced litter deposition near trees, and the movement of needles away from trees by ants (Formica sibylla) and wind, reduce the amount of litter near trees and likely contribute to the long-term maintenance of clearings. Stem flow resulting from rare heavy rain events also appears to play a role in clearing maintenance. All of the abiotic factors investigated interact with the physical structure of the tree to remove pine needles from the bases of trees, but ants move needles independently to facilitate clearing maintenance and indirectly enhance tree fitness when fires occur. Given how generally common F. sibylla is in Jeffrey pine habitat and the relative stability of the abiotic processes that also contribute to maintaining clearings (wind, precipitation, and needle fall), we may expect to see clearings form in other Jeffrey pine forests after prescribed fires are introduced.  This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time and is therefore in the public domain.",

    "abstract": "Despite being commonly used as systematic characters earlier this century, relatively few systematists currently use behavioral information for phylogenetic reconstruction. A natural experiment provided by the inferred phylogenetic relationships and host associations of a tribe of ant guest beetles allows for a novel test of the phylogenetic utility of behavior.  Historical and current evolutionary forces have acted in opposition during recent behavioral evolution, making it possible to determine the relative evolutionary lability of two general classes of behavioral characters. I dissected the behavioral phenotype into two components and tested for the relative presence of these two opposing forces on each behavioral component. Behavior was broken up into the continuously differing behavioral component (durations of functionally similar beetle behaviors) and the discretely differing behavioral component (species-typical behaviors). Conducting a series of statistic and cladistic tests on each component separately, I concluded that current evolutionary forces primarily determined the continuous behavioral component, because it was most similar among heterogeneric, nestmate beetle species. In contrast, I concluded that ancient evolutionary forces determined the discrete component because it was most similar among congeneric, non-nestmate species. These results support two hypotheses. First, the durations for which behaviors are performed evolve quicker than do species-typical behavioral traits. Second, species-typical behavioral characters are often as nonhomoplastic for phylogenetic reconstruction as are morphological characters.",

    "abstract": "Granivorous ants in the southwestern desert of the United States are characterized by species-specific colony foraging behaviors that determine their efficiencies at utilizing seeds from different density distributions. Workers search for food either in groups or as individuals, and these feeding strategies represent specialisations for high and low density resources respectively. While gathering experimental seeds, simultaneously supplied in clumped and dispersed distributions, feeding by group foragers focused on the high density resource patches, while individual foragers harvested seeds predominantly from the dispersed distribution which required that prey be independently discovered. Collecting native seeds from unmanipulated environments, individual foragers tended to spend proportionately more time searching and experience lower foraging success than did group foragers in the same local habitat. During a period of high seed abundance, group foragers collected a much narrower range of prey types than did individual foragers. Colonies of Pogonomyrmex rugosus exhibited a mixed foraging strategy, with the most distinct feeding columns occurring during a period of peak seed abundance. Among group foragers, greatest activity coincided with periods of relatively high seed densities and low climatic stress, and these species utilized tactics such as seed storage, hibernation, and estivation to weather less favorable periods in a resting state. Individual foragers were active at intermediate levels during less favorable periods. Although high and low density seed resources are not renewed independently of one another, density specialization appears to promote coexistence between group and individual foragers. Their capacity to stably partition resources in this way should depend on (1) the degree of differences in their efficiencies at exploiting different density distributions of seeds and (2) the availability of seeds in the habitat as a function of seed density. In more mesic habitats, where seeds are renewed more frequently and probably also in larger pulses, group foraging species are proportionately more abundant.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of species diversity and community organization in desert seed-eating ants were studied in 10 habitats on a longitudinal gradient of increasing rainfall extending from the southeastern California, through southern Arizona, and into southwestern New Mexico. Local communities of harvester ants include 2-7 common species, and at least 15 species from five genera of Myrmecines [sic] compose the total species pool in these deserts. Ant species diversity is highly correlated with mean annual precipitation, an index of productivity in arid regions. Communities are structured on the basis of competition for food, and interspecific differences in worker body sizes and colony foraging strategies represent important mechanisms of resource allocation. Seed size preferences, measured for native seeds and in food choice experiments with seeds of different size but uniform nutritional quality, are highly correlated with worker body sizes. Species of similar body sizes can coexist within local habitats if they differ in foraging strategy. Interspecific aggression and territorial defense and microhabitat partitioning all appear to be relatively unimportant in these ant communities. Patterns of species diversity and community organization in harvester ants are strikingly similar to those reported for communities of seed-eating rodents that occupy many of the same desert habitats. Separate regressions of within-habitat species diversity against the precipitation index of productivity for the two groups correspond closely in slope, intercept, and proportion of explained variation. Resource allocation on the basis of seed size characterize both communities of both ants and rodents. Parallels between these two groups suggest that limits to specialization and overlap may be specified by parameters such as resource abundance and predictability that affect unrelated taxa similarly.",

    "abstract": "*[Chronic ingestion of 4 environmentally common forms of selenium at environmentally reported concentrations, were found to cause mortality among Argentine ant workers.  The extent of mortality was found to be dependent on the form of selenium.  In addition, mortality & bioaccumulation of selenium increased with the duration of exposure & concentration.  Argentine ants were not deterred by lethal concentrations of selenium in the diet, regardless of background sucrose concentrations.  The transfer of selenium via a tri-trophic system was assessed.  Aphid honeydew, a major component of the diet for Argentine ants in their introduced range, was found to serve as a route of selenium transfer to ant colonies.  Sub-lethal concentrations of selenium were found to impact reproduction for Argentine ant colonies, where colonies exposed to selenium sucrose diets experienced reduced queen fecundity, queen mortality, & reduced viability for offspring.  Selenium did not alter the competitive ability of Argentine ant workers during interactions with the native species, Dorymyrmex bicolor, but sub-lethal concentrations did contribute to a longer food discovery time for the native species.  Native ant communities residing in a selenium-contaminated habitat were also documented.  Ant species composition differed across sites, but selenium did not appear to have an overall impact on diversity.  Ant concentrations differed by species, but were comparable to levels found among other arthropod trophic groups.  Results suggest that these ants residing have evolved a high tolerance to this particular pollutant.]",

    "abstract": "The selenium contamination event that occurred at Kesterson Reservoir (Merced Co., CA) during the 1970\u001380s is a frequently cited example for the negative effects of contamination on wildlife. Despite the importance of arthropods for ecosystem services and functioning, relatively little information is available as to the impacts of pollution on arthropod community dynamics. We conducted surveys of the arthropod community present at Kesterson Reservoir to assess the impacts of selenium contamination on arthropod diversity, with a focus on ant species richness, composition and density. Trophic groups were compared to determine which arthropods were potentially receiving the greatest selenium exposure. Plant samples were analyzed to determine the selenium content by site and by location within plant. Soil concentrations varied across the study sites, but not across habitat types. Topsoil contained higher levels of selenium compared to core samples. Plants contained similar concentrations of selenium in their leaves, stems and flowers, but flowers contained the greatest range of concentrations. Individuals within the detritivores/decomposers and predators accumulated the greatest concentrations of selenium, whereas nectarivores contained the lowest concentrations. Species composition differed across the sites: Dorymyrmex bicolor was located only at the site containing the greatest soil selenium concentration, but Solenopsis xyloni was found at most sites and was predominant at six of the sites. Selenium concentrations in ants varied by species and collection sites. Nest density was also found to differ across sites, but was not related to soil selenium or any of the habitat variables measured in our study. Selenium was not found to impact species richness, but was a significant variable for the occurrence of two out of the eight native species identified.",

    "abstract": "1. Uptake of environmental contaminants by lower trophic groups can have negative effects on higher trophic groups. This study tested the ability of selenium, an environmental contaminant found in high concentrations throughout the tissues of certain accumulating plants, to be transferred to ants via aphid tissue and honeydew. 2. Plants of the selenium accumulator, Raphanus sativus (wild radish), were watered with three different selenium treatments (0, 0.25 or 0.5 µg Se ml\\1). Aphids, Myzus persicae, and Argentine ant colonies, Linepithema humile, were added to each caged plant and allowed to interact freely. Ant colonies were supplemented with one of three different food options to encourage the consumption of aphids, aphid honeydew, or aphids and honeydew. 3. The accumulation of selenium by each trophic group and a trophic transfer factor (TTF) was calculated. The TTF for plants to aphids was >1, indicating biomagnification, whereas the TTF for aphids to worker ants was <1, indicating only biotransfer. Accumulated levels by worker ants did not statistically differ as a result of diet. 4. The amounts of selenium acquired by ants as a factor of diet and caste were compared. Plants, aphids and worker ants accumulated selenium in a dose-dependent manner. Ant queens did not contain detectable amounts of selenium. Honeydew contained comparable amounts of selenium to plant selenium levels. 5. Access to toxic compounds via honeydew and insect protein may have negative effects on the range expansion of invasive species, such as the Argentine ant.",

However, few studies have investigated the impact of environmental contamination on competitive behavior in ants as a potential factor influencing dynamics between invasive and native ant species. Here we investigated the widespread contaminant selenium to investigate its potential influence on invasion by the exotic Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, through effects on reproduction and competitive behavior. For the fecundity experiment, treatments were provided to Argentine ant colonies via to sugar water solutions containing one of three concentrations of selenium (0, 5 and 10 ºg Se mL-1) that fall within the range found in soil and plants growing in contaminated areas. Competition experiments included both the Argentine ant and the native Dorymyrmex bicolor to determine the impact of selenium exposure (0 or 15 ºg Se mL-1) on exploitation- and interference-competition between ant species. The results of the fecundity experiment revealed that selenium negatively impacted queen survival and brood production of Argentine ants. Viability of the developing brood was also affected in that offspring reached adulthood only in colonies that were not given selenium, whereas those in treated colonies died in their larval stages. Selenium exposure did not alter direct competitive behaviors for either species, but selenium exposure contributed to an increased bait discovery time for D. bicolor. Our results suggest that environmental toxins may not only pose problems for native ant species, but may also serve as a potential obstacle for establishment among exotic species.",

    "abstract": "Ants are known for the important roles they play in processes contributing to ecosystem functioning in many habitats. However, pollutants can impact the ecosystem services provided by ants. The Argentine ant, an invasive species in North America, was investigated for the potential impact selenium (Se) may have on ants residing within a contaminated habitat. Mortality tests were conducted using worker ants fed an artificial nectar source containing 1-of-4 environmentally common Se compounds (forms): seleno-l-methionine, methylselenocysteine, selenate or selenite. Accumulation of Se in ant bodies at the end of two weeks was quantified with the use of hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy. Lastly, we conducted choice tests using dyes to determine whether ants might avoid a carbohydrate diet containing Se by providing them a choice between sucrose with or without Se. Choice tests also tested the responses of ants to selenium when provided in different background sucrose concentrations. The results of this study indicated that form and quantity of Se, as well as time of exposure, impact mortality in Argentine ant workers. Methylselenocysteine and selenate were found to be the most toxic among the 4 chemical forms when presented in sucrose solutions, whereas seleno-l-methionine and selenite caused greater Se body burdens. Furthermore, choice tests showed that ants did not prefer control sucrose solution to sucrose treated with Se regardless of the background sucrose concentration. These findings serve as first look into the possible detrimental impacts these contaminants may pose for ants that frequent sugary nectar sources.",

Two components of harvesting efficiency are defined: total harvesting efficiency (i.e., all food items considered) and seed harvesting efficiency (only seeds considered). Throughout the summer, total harvesting efficiency remained constant, whereas seed\u0014harvesting efficiency exhibited an increase as a result of changes in the relative availability of the dominant seed crop, Erodium cicutarium. Several aspects of interference were studied. Colonies were uniformly spaced, and nest relocations significantly increased nearest\u0014neighbor distance. Of encounters between ants from different colonies, 81% resulted in some form of aggression and 7% were fatal to one or both foragers. In a particular study, forager mortality rate was estimated at 0.06 deaths per ant foraging hour, thus indicating that such aggression may have a substantial impact on colony size. Furthermore, following an encounter involving physical struggle, ants returned to and remained in their nests for an extended period of time, thereby reducing seed input to the colony. The above-mentioned components of interference are examined to their potential effects on colony density, distribution, and size.",

    "abstract": "The correct identification of colony boundaries is an essential prerequisite for empirical studies of ant behavior and evolution. Ant colonies function at various organizational levels, and these boundaries may be difficult to assess. Moreover, new complexity can be generated through the presence of spatially discrete subgroups within a more or less genetically homogeneous colony, a situation called polydomy. A colony is polydomous only if individuals (workers and brood) of its constituent nests function as a social and cooperative unit and are regularly interchanged among nests. This condition was previously called polycalic, and the term polydomy was used in a broader sense for a group of daughter nests of the same mother colony (implying limited female dispersal), without regard to whether these different nests continued to exchange individuals. We think that this distinction between 'polycaly' and 'polydomy' concerns two disparate concepts. We thus prefer the narrower definition of polydomy, which groups individuals that interact socially. Does this new level of organization affect the way in which natural selection acts on social traits? Here, after examining the history of terms, we review all ant species that have been described as expressing polydomous structures. We show that there is no particular syndrome of traits predictably associated with polydomy.

    "abstract": "We compared seed banks between two contrasting anthropogenic surface disturbances (compacted, trenched) and adjacent undisturbed controls to determine whether site condition influences viable seed densities of perennial and annual Mojave Desert species. Viable seeds of perennials were rare in undisturbed areas (3-4 seeds/m2) and declined to <1 seed/m2 within disturbed sites. Annual seed densities were an order of magnitude greater than those of perennials, were one-third the undisturbed seed densities on compacted sites, but doubled on trenched sites relative to controls. On trenched sites, greater litter cover comprising the infructescences of the dominant spring annuals, and low gravel content, enhanced seed densities of both annuals and perennials. Litter cover and surface ruggedness were the best explanations for viable perennial seed densities on compacted sites, but litter cover and the presence of a common harvester ant explained annual seed densities better than any other surface characteristics that were examined. Surface disturbances can have a varied impact on the condition of the soil surface in arid lands. Nevertheless, the consistently positive relationship between ground cover of litter and viable seed density emphasizes the importance of litter as an indicator of site degradation and recovery potential in arid lands.

    "abstract": "Climate change is transforming precipitation regimes world\u0010wide. Changes in precipitation regimes are known to have powerful effects on plant productivity, but the consequences of these shifts for the dynamics of ecological communities are poorly understood. This knowledge gap hinders our ability to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Precipitation may affect fauna through direct effects on physiology, behaviour or demography, through plant\u0010mediated indirect effects, or by modifying interactions among species. In this paper, we examined the response of a semi\u0010arid ecological community to a fivefold change in precipitation over 7 years. We examined the effects of precipitation on the dynamics of a grassland ecosystem in central California from 2007 to 2013. We conducted vegetation surveys, pitfall trapping of invertebrates, visual surveys of lizards and capture-mark-recapture surveys of rodents on 30 plots each year. We used structural equation modelling to evaluate the direct, indirect and modifying effects of precipitation on plants, ants, beetles, orthopterans, kangaroo rats, ground squirrels and lizards. We found pervasive effects of precipitation on the ecological community. Although precipitation increased plant biomass, direct effects on fauna were often stronger than plant\u0010mediated effects. In addition, precipitation altered the sign or strength of consumer\u0010resource and facilitative interactions among the faunal community such that negative or neutral interactions became positive or vice versa with increasing precipitation. These findings indicate that precipitation influences ecological communities in multiple ways beyond its recognized effects on primary productivity. Stochastic variation in precipitation may weaken the average strength of biotic interactions over time, thereby increasing ecosystem stability and resilience to climate change.",

Aphaenogaster has a complicated taxonomic history due to variability of taxonomic characters. Novomessor Emery was previously synonymized with Aphaenogaster, which was justified by the partial mesonotal suture observed in Aphaenogaster ensifera Forel. Previous studies using Bayesian phylogenies with molecular data suggest Aphaenogaster is polyphyletic. Convergent evolution and retention of ancestral similarities are two major factors contributing to nonmonophyly of Aphaenogaster. Based on 42 multistate morphological characters and five genes, we found Novomessor more closely related to Veromessor Forel and that this clade is sister to Aphaenogaster. Our results confirm the validity of Novomessor stat. r. as a separate genus, and it is resurrected based on the combination of new DNA, morphological, behavioral, and ecological data.",

    "abstract": "Twenty\u0010three Aphaenogaster species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) occur in North America. While morphology and ecology define most species, the species limits of a group in the Eastern United States are unclear. In particular, the morphological and behavioural characters of A. carolinensis, A. picea and A. rudis overlap. These observations suggest that these three species are not monophyletic. We therefore tested the monophyly of Aphaenogaster in the context of molecular phylogenetic analyses. We used DNA data from five genes: CO1, CAD, EF1±F2, long\u0010wavelength rhodopsin and wingless, to reconstruct phylogenies for 44 Aphaenogaster and outgroup species. In the resulting trees, reconstructed using parsimony and Bayesian inference, species boundaries associated with well\u0010supported monophyletic clades of individuals in most of the 23 North American Aphaenogaster collected from multiple locations. However, some clades were unresolved, and both A. picea and A. rudis were not monophyletic. Although this may indicate that clades of multiple species represent fewer but morphologically varied species, given the short branch lengths, the lack of resolution may reflect the fact that these ants have recently radiated, and a lack of gene lineage sorting explains the non\u0010monophyly of species. Additional biological information concerning pre\u0010 and postmating barriers is needed before a complete revision of species boundaries for Aphaenogaster.

    "abstract": "Cooperatively foraging groups have two sequential goals: to find food and thereafter efficiently exploit or retrieve it. Previous research has largely focused on searching behaviours of individuals or organization of food retrieval processes, rather than on how groups initially distribute themselves to find ephemeral food items that are unpredictable in time and space. In the present study, we examined how Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, search environments in anticipation of food appearing briefly in areas with differing spatial complexity. Nests were connected to three foraging arenas containing 1, 9 or 25 cells. Food appeared briefly in one cell each day, either randomly or more predictably in distant cells (but equally often in each arena). We recorded the number of ants in cells when food had not been recently present, and thereafter whether ants successfully located the food when presented. Surprisingly, as food location became more predictable, ants found it less frequently. Foragers were located more often in cells closer to the nest (i.e. at information \u0018choke points\u0019 that returning foragers needed to traverse), and in cells with higher connectivity and greater centralness within foraging arenas. Such distributions reduce search coverage area but likely increase information transmission. Thus, it appears that L. humile foragers distribute themselves to favour rapid recruitment when food is found rather than maximizing food encounter rates. Although the reduced foraging success with more predictably located food suggests that ants did not adjust expectations in a Bayesian manner within arenas towards individual cells, they did appear Bayesian across arenas. Because foragers missed food more often in higher-complexity arenas than in lower-complexity arenas, this could increase perceptions that the latter are more rewarding. Shifts in distributions were consistent with such biased perceptions. Future studies to determine whether other group-foraging species use analogous solutions would be highly useful.",

    "abstract": "Background: Imported fire ants now infest more than 310 million acres in the United States and Puerto Rico. Colonies have been found in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Virginia. Available reports suggest that each year, fire ants sting more than 50% of persons in endemic areas, resulting in a variety of medical consequences. Objective: To describe fire ant attacks among patients in health care facilities. Design: Case series and literature review. Setting: Two nursing homes in Mississippi. Patients: Two nursing home residents. Measurements: Clinical records to describe clinical sequelae of multiple stings. Results: With the 2 incidents reported here, the total number of reported indoor fire ant attacks on humans since 1989 is 10. Six of the persons attacked, including the 2 nursing home residents described here (who died after the stings), had preexisting neurologic impairment. Eight of the 10 attacks have been reported in the past 4 years. Conclusions: The presence of fire ants in occupied dwellings indicates the presence of active fire ant colonies in the immediate proximity. Efforts to eradicate these insects should be undertaken immediately, especially if immobile persons are present. These persons should be considered at risk for fire ant attacks as long as the ants are present.

We assessed the effects of browsing by deer and seed predation by rodents, ants and birds on the densities of seeds entering the seed bank of Ceanothus cuneatus var. rigidus, a maritime chaparral shrub in coastal California. Ceanothus produced many more seeds when protected from browsers in long-term experimental exclosures than did browsed plants, but the seed densities in the soil beneath browsed and unbrowsed Ceanothus were the same at the start of an intensive one-year study. The density of seeds in the soil initially increased in both treatments following summer seed drop: while densities returned to pre-drop levels within a few weeks under browsed plants, soil seed densities remained high for 5-8 months beneath unbrowsed plants. Rodent abundance (especially deer mice) was higher near unbrowsed plants than >30 m away, and rodents removed Ceanothus seeds from dishes in the experimental plots. At least in the short term, rodent density and rates of seed removal were inversely related to the intensity of browsing. Our data have management implications for maintaining viable Ceanothus populations by regulating the intensity of browsing and the timing, intensity and frequency of fires.",

    "abstract": "Macroecology evaluates the partitioning of physical space and resources among organisms through correlation among ecological variables, such as geographical range size and shape, body size, and population density, measured at large geographical and taxonomic scales. In this article, we analyzed the spatial patterns in worker body size and geographic range size for the 27 described species of honey ants, genus Myrmecocystus Wesmael, in the United States and Mexico, and especially the relationship between these 2 variables after statistically removing their spatial patterns. The 2 variables are correlated, but also displayed significant spatial patterns, as detected by trend surface and spatial autocorrelation analyses. After removing these spatial effects, worker body size and geographic range size were still positively correlated. The relationship, therefore, is not a consequence of spatial effects and it does follow Brown's model, which predicts that the geographic range size will have a positive slope on body size. In this model, the lower population densities caused by foraging activities and local territorial competition are associated with a large geographic range, avoiding stochastic extinction. Although this constraint in local population density does not necessarily hold for small organisms such as insects that could achieve high densities even in very small areas and patchy habitats, it may hold for social insects, especially ants, because of the local competition among colonies.           *[Data on body size & geographic distribution extracted from Snelling, R.R., 1976, A revision of the honey ants, genus Myrmecocystus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), Nat.

Now that we have identified F. aerata, as the most important peach twig borer predator, the question remains whether or not this predator can be manipulated to the growers' advantage.  We have observed that in peach orchards managed without in-season, broad spectrum insecticides, 2 ant species are commonly found, F. aerata and the southern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni, with F. aerata being the dominant species.

    "abstract": "The proximate controls of a behaviour in extant species can inform us about the evolutionary route towards that behavioural phenotype. In social insects, different behavioural phenotypes often correlate with divergent hormone levels, and, in honeybees (Apis mellifera), this insight has lead to the hypothesis that behavioural biases, or division of labour, emerged via co-option of endocrine regulatory systems that paced behavioural change during the reproductive cycle of solitary ancestors. Founding queens of the California harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus show discrete behavioural changes during colony founding, with a dichotomy between nest-biased behaviour and field-biased behaviour. Additionally, a division of labour can develop if queens found nests together, with one queen being nest-biased and another being field-biased. To determine whether behavioural diphenism can be associated with reproductive endocrine regulators in an ant, we measured ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone (JH) content in (1) single-founding queens showing normal behavioural progression and (2) cofounding queens showing a division of labour. We found that ecdysteroid levels did not correlate with behaviour. JH titres, on the other hand, were elevated during the foraging life stage of single-founding queens as well as in the cofounding queens with a behavioural bias towards foraging. Our results suggest that JH affects the propensity for foraging task replication in P. californicus, and provide evidence for a common evolutionary route towards social behaviour in ants and bees.

We offered these caterpillars to predacous ants & observed the effects of the following on predation: diet (artificial vs. leaf), site (ant colonies in dry vs. wet areas), instar (early vs. late), & time (changes in predation over 5 days).  Diet & site were consistently significant predictors of the ants' propensities to reject prey & the caterpillars' abilities to escape predation.  Leaf-diet caterpillars escaped more frequently than artificial-diet caterpillars, & ants from dry sites were more likely to reject prey than ants from wet sites.  The percentage of iridoid glycosides found in individual caterpillars was also a good predictor of the probability of rejection by predators & prey escape.  Caterpillars with higher levels of iridoids were more likely to be rejected & to escape, suggesting that sequestered iridoid glycosides are a defense against predaceous ants.]",

    "abstract": "Although it has been speculated that ant visits to extrafloral nectaries of bracken fern may convey a fitness benefit for the plant, this has never been demonstrated with native herbivores and natural insect densities. We tested the hypothesis that ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries of bracken fern provide a mutualistic benefit by protecting fronds from herbivore damage in a field manipulation experiment in southern California. We examined densities of sawfly eggs and larvae on bracken fronds with and without ant exclusion. Because bracken fern in this region is also impacted by nitrogenous air pollution, we included an N addition treatment. We found that sawfly egg abundance was significantly higher for fern plants when ants were excluded, regardless of N treatment. Ants tended to have higher abundance on fertilized plants, but there was no interaction between N additions and ant exclusion. Bracken fern may derive a fitness benefit from attracting ants during the early phases of plant growth, through decreased herbivore oviposition, rather than through the deterrence of feeding larvae.",

Water from sprinkler irrigation washed propagules into the soil around the plants. Viable propagules of Phytophthora citricola were identified in the feces of snails (Helix aspersa) that had fed on infected bark tissues. When these snails were moved to healthy plants, they made wounds on succulent tissue, and the infectious feces induced cankers. Ants (Iridomyrmex humilis) were attracted to the sugary exudate and also transmitted infectious propagules to wounds on avocado stems and to the soil.

Most common predators causing partial depredations  were ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis & P. guttatus), kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula), & fire ants (Solenopsis spp.).  We used logistic regression & model selection methods to assess 6 cues that parents may use to determine the value of  remaining offspring & resulting abandonment decision.

    "abstract": "The role of the ant colony largely consists of non-reproductive tasks, such as foraging, tending brood, and defense. However, workers are vitally linked to reproduction through their provisioning of sexual offspring, which are produced annually to mate and initiate new colonies. Gynes (future queens) have size-associated variation in colony founding strategy (claustrality), with each strategy requiring different energetic investments from their natal colony. We compared the per capita production cost required for semi-claustral, facultative, and claustral gynes across four species of Pogonomyrmex harvester ants. We found that the claustral founding strategy is markedly expensive, costing approximately 70% more energy than that of the semi-claustral strategy. Relative to males, claustral gynes also had the largest differential investment and smallest size variation. We applied these investment costs to a model by Brown and Bonhoeffer (2003) that predicts founding strategy based on investment cost and foraging survivorship. The model predicts that non-claustral foundresses must survive the foraging period with a probability of 30-36% in order for a foraging strategy to be selectively favored. These results highlight the importance of incorporating resource investment at the colony level when investigating the evolution of colony founding strategies in ants.",

    "abstract": "The invasive success of the exotic Argentine ant [Linepithema humile (Mayr)] is often closely tied to year-round availability of water sources. Previous studies suggest that the location of such water sources can strongly influence activity patterns of colonies and may be a key predictor of building infestations. We studied activity patterns of Argentine ants in relation to water and food resources in two open-air structures (aviaries). In one series of manipulations, ant activity inside the aviaries was significantly reduced with the placement of numerous water sources around the outside. Inside activity increased again when the outside water sources were removed. A second series of manipulations involved the placement of water sources at targeted locations outside of the structures. Ant activity inside the aviaries consistently shifted significantly closer to these targeted sites. The results suggest that providing a reliable water source to Argentine ant colonies exterior to buildings can be a non-chemical method of integrated pest management for reducing ant infestations. Independent of our manipulations, L. humile activity levels predictably declined with time of day, but these changes were uncorrelated with observed surface temperatures. In fact, activity was often noted at surface temperatures higher than those that cause worker mortality under laboratory conditions. This suggests that L. humile exhibits a consistent Temperature-independent circadian activity pattern of reduced foraging in afternoons relative to mornings.",

    "abstract": "Ants exhibit a size-associated colony founding trait that is characterized by the degree to which foundresses rely on internal reserves to raise their first brood of workers (claustrality). The reliance on stored reserves is positively correlated with degree of claustrality (claustral > facultative > semi-claustral) and is variable across species of Pogonomyrmex harvester ants. Three species of harvester ant foundresses that differ in degree of claustrality were observed initiating nests under laboratory conditions over 2 years. P. rugosus is fully claustral, P. salinus is facultative, and P. californicus is semi-claustral. Across species, degree of claustrality was positively associated with mean digging rate and nest depth over the first 3 days of nest initiation, total nest depth, and degree of nest closure. Branching and abundance of peripheral nodes were higher in semi-claustral and facultative nests than in claustral nests. The facultative species dug for the longest time and achieved the greatest tunnel length. Within each species, there were trends associating mass with digging rate, but these were not consistent in all species. There were no intraspecific trends of mass with nest depth. Also within species, a foundress's mass did not affect her tendency to open or close her nest. These results reveal degree of claustrality is correlated across species with several nest initiation characteristics that together may represent different colony founding syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Parents often face an investment trade-off between either producing many small or fewer large offspring. When environments vary predictably, the fittest parental solution matches available resources by varying only number of offspring and never optimal individual size. However when mismatches occur often between parental expectations and true resource levels, dynamic models like multifaceted parental investment (MFPI) and parental optimism (PO) both predict offspring size can vary significantly. MFPI is a \"realist\" strategy: parents assume future environments of average richness. When resources exceed expectations and it is too late to add more offspring, the best-case solution increases investment per individual. Brood size distributions therefore track the degree of mismatch from right-skewed around an optimal size (slight underestimation of resources) to left-skewed around a maximal size (gross underestimation). Conversely, PO is an \"optimist\" strategy: parents assume maximally good resource futures and match numbers to that situation. Normal or lean years do not affect \"core\" brood as costs primarily fall on excess \"marginal\" siblings who die or experience stunted growth (producing left-skewed distributions). Investment patterns supportive of both MFPI and PO models have been observed in nature, but studies that directly manipulate food resources to test predictions are lacking. Ant colonies produce many offspring per reproductive cycle and are amenable to experimental manipulation in ways that can differentiate between MFPI and PO investment strategies. Colonies in a natural population of a harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex salinus) were protein-supplemented over 2 years, and mature sexual offspring were collected annually prior to their nuptial flight. Several results support either MFPI or PO in terms of patterns in offspring size distributions and how protein differentially affected male and female production. Unpredicted by either model, however, is that supplementation affected distributions more strongly across years than within (e.g., small females are significantly rarer in the year after colonies receive protein). Parental investment strategies in P. salinus vary dynamically across years and conditions. Finding that past conditions can more strongly affect reproductive decisions than current ones, however, is not addressed by models of parental investment.",

    "abstract": "The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Buren), is an invasive species in the southern United States and is expanding its range westward to California and eastward up the Atlantic Coast. This voracious predator can reach extremely high densities and have widespread effects once it invades an ecosystem. We conducted a 2-yr sampling study and a series of greenhouse and field experiments to document the impact of red imported fire ants on beneficial insects in cotton. We found that the densities of 12 of 13 natural enemies sampled on cotton plants in 1999, and 8 out of 8 sampled in 2000, were negatively correlated with the densities of foraging fire ant workers. Red imported fire ants reduced the survival of lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., and Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by 50% and green lacewing larvae (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) by 38% in greenhouse experiments. Fire ants did not, however, reduce the survival of spiders (Oxyopidae, Thomisidae, and Clubionidae). We used a commercially available fire ant bait to suppress fire ant populations in cotton fields during the 2000 growing season and compared the densities of beneficial arthropods in treated versus control fields. Densities of lady beetles, spiders, and big-eyed bugs (Heteroptera: Geocoridae) were significantly higher in fields with suppressed fire ant populations than in fields with relatively large fire ant populations.

Colonies differed significantly in minimum critical water content of individual foragers (= water content below which foragers are incapable of normal locomotion).  In one colony small workers had disproportionately higher water content than larger workers.  In the other colony water content was isometric with body size.  Groups of workers confined in the field approached water content only after normal foraging stopped & substrate temperatures exceeded 45C, while water content of individual foragers did not approach the water content during normal foraging periods.  Moreover, seed load & distance travelled did not negatively affect forager water content, as measured on return to the nest.

Moreover, the introduction process itself has been hypothesised to act as a selective filter for traits that promote invasiveness. We tested the hypothesis that behaviours thought to promote invasiveness - such as increased foraging activity and aggression - are selected for during invasion by comparing traits among native and introduced populations of the widespread Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We studied Argentine ant populations in the native range in Argentina and in three invaded regions along an introduction pathway: California, Australia and New Zealand. In each region, we set up 32 experimental colonies to measure foraging activity and interspecific aggression in a subset of the study regions. These colonies were subject to experimental manipulation of carbohydrate availability and octopamine, a biogenic amine known to modulate behaviour in insects, to measure variation in behavioural plasticity. We found variation in foraging activity among populations, but this variation was not consistent with selection on behaviour in relation to the invasion process. We found that colonies with limited access to carbohydrates exhibited unchanged exploratory behaviour, but higher exploitation activity and lower aggression. Colonies given octopamine consistently increased foraging behaviour (both exploration and exploitation), as well as aggression when also sugar\u0010deprived. There was no difference in the degree of behavioural response to our experimental treatments along the introduction pathway. We did not find support for selection of behavioural traits associated with invasiveness along the Argentine ant's introduction pathway or clear evidence for an association between the introduction process and variation in behavioural plasticity. These results indicate that mechanisms promote behavioural variation in a similar fashion both in native and introduced ranges. Our results challenge the assumption that introduced populations always perform better in key behavioural traits hypothesised to be associated with invasion success.",

We propose a variance-based emergent property model in which division of labor can spontaneously emerge when (1) individuals in a group vary in their intrinsic sensitivity to stimuli for a given task, & (2) the performance of a task by individuals with higher task sensitivities reduces performance of the task by the other group members.  Under these conditions, the individuals with higher sensitivity become the task specialists.  To determine if division of labor can occur in the absence of direct selection, we created artificial foundress associations (groups of queens during nest establishment) of the ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus, which has no history of cooperative colony founding.  We compared the incidence of task specialization in this species to that in Pogonomyrmex californicus, in which foundress associations commonly occur.  Levels of task specialization for nest excavation were high in both species, arguing that division of labor emerges in groups regardless of evolutionary history.  Consistent with the variance-based model, the role of nest excavation specialist in P. barbatus foundress associations could be predicted by both (1) differences in excavation roles in prior pairs & (2) variation in excavation activity while solitary.  Furthermore, the assumption of the excavator role by one foundress dramatically reduced the performance of that task by the other foundress of the pair.  We also found a strong negative relationship between excavation activity & foundress survival in P. barbatus, suggesting that division of labor in this context may act as a constraint on social evolution.]",

A total of 310 species in 56 genera were recorded from Monts Doudou.  This is the highest species richness of ants yet recorded in Africa.  Species richness was relatively constant along the elevational gradient surveyed (210 species at 110 m & 206 species at 375 m & 640 m).  Comparison of ant species turnover along the gradient, did not show evidence of variation with respect to elevation.  Based on one well-studied group, Dacetonini, most species have previously been recorded from Gabon & have broad distribution ranges across the western Congo Basin.  Leaf litter methods captured the greatest number of species followed by sweeping, beating, & general collecting.  Yellow pan, pitfall traps, & Malaise traps collected the fewest species.  Sweeping is rarely conducted in ant inventories, but these results suggest it should be included in the Afrotropical region.]",

We analyzed data from a 17 year study of the distribution of the non-native Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) and the native winter ant (Prenolepis imparis) in a preserve in northern California (U.S.A.). We conducted logistic regressions and used model selection to determine whether the following variables were associated with changes in the distribution of each species: presence of conspecifics at neighboring sites, distance to development (e.g., roads, buildings, and landscaped areas), proportion of vegetation cover taller than 0.75 m, elevation, distance to water, presence of both species at a site, temperature, and rainfall. Argentine ants colonized unoccupied sites from neighboring sites, but the probability of appearance and persistence decreased as distance to development, vegetation cover, and elevation increased. Winter ants appeared and persisted in sites with relatively high vegetation cover (i.e., highly shaded sites). Presence of the 2 species was negatively associated in sites with high vegetation cover (more winter ants) and sites near development (more Argentine ants). Probability of colonization of Argentine ants decreased where winter ants were most persistent. At sites near development within the preserve, abundant Argentine ant populations may be excluding winter ants. The high abundance of Argentine ants at these sites may be due to immigration from suburban areas outside the preserve, which are high-quality habitat for Argentine ants. In the interior of the preserve, distance from development, low-quality habitat, and interaction with winter ants may in combination exclude Argentine ants. Interactions among the variables we examined were associated with low probabilities of Argentine ant colonization in the preserve.",

Our model was based on observations of ant presence and absence but, unlike other models based on presence-absence data, it incorporated the process of invasion by spread from neighboring areas. Simulations were parameterized from a statistical analysis of a 17-year survey of ant distributions in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in northern California. We simulated the effects of Argentine ant presence at neighboring grid squares, distance to development, presence of the native winter ant Prenolepis imparis, and other habitat and climate variables, and used these models to simulate invasion over many decades. The best predictions of the extent of Argentine ant invasion were based on the distance of each site to developed areas. Adding the effect of neighbors improved the predictions of the time at which sites would be invaded. Winter ants responded mainly to vegetation cover. Our results suggest that Argentine ants may reach their potential distribution in insular urban reserves rapidly, perhaps within 10 years, and that reserve size determines whether the reserve is likely to become fully invaded.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species are a global threat to biodiversity, and understanding their history and biology is a major goal of invasion biology. Population\u0010genetic approaches allow insights into these features, as population structure is shaped by factors such as invasion history (number, origin and age of introductions) and life\u0010history traits (e.g., mating system, dispersal capability). We compared the relative importance of these factors by investigating two closely related ants, Tetramorium immigrans and Tetramorium tsushimae, that differ in their social structure and invasion history in North America. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite alleles to estimate the source and number of introduction events of the two species, and compared genetic structure among native and introduced populations. Genetic diversity of both species was strongly reduced in introduced populations, which also differed genetically from native populations. Genetic differentiation between ranges and the reduction in microsatellite diversity were more severe in the more recently introduced and supercolonial T. tsushimae. However, the loss of mitochondrial haplotype diversity was more pronounced in T. immigrans, which has single\u0010queen colonies and was introduced earlier. Tetramorium immigrans was introduced at least twice from Western Europe to North America and once independently to South America. Its monogyny might have limited genetic diversity per introduction, but new mutations and successive introductions over a long time may have added to the gene pool in the introduced range.

    "abstract": "Studies stimulated by the International Biological Program showed total insect faunal biomass and diversity to be greatest in the spring of the year, which matches increased plant growth and flowering at this time. Ground-inhabiting beetle studies indicated the family Tenebrionidae to be overwhelmingly dominant in biomass, but the family Staphylinidae to be richest in species numbers. Ant studies showed the chaparral community to be rich in ant species; seed gatherers were particularly important. Flower-visiting insects are more abundant and more species-rich in chaparral than in any other type of California vegetation. Bees especially are abundant and diversified and are responsible for most pollination. Postfire succession studies of insects indicate that the abundance of predators and flower visitors sharply increases following fire; parasitic and phytophagous insects (other than flower-visitors) increase more slowly. Insect herbivory appears to affect succession minimally.   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)",

We investigate the hypothesis that protection from predators offered to caterpillars by ants might facilitate host-range evolution.  Specifically, experiments with the butterfly Lycaeides melissa investigated the role of ant association in the use of a novel host, alfalfa, Medicago sativa, which is a sub-optimal host for larval development.  Survival on alfalfa is increased by the presence of ants, thus supporting the hypothesis that interaction with ants might be important for host-range evolution.  Using a demographic model to explore ecological conditions associated with host-range expansion in L. melissa, we conclude that the presence of ants might be an essential component for populations persisting on the novel, sub-optimal host.]",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions by nonnative plant species are a widespread phenomenon. Many studies have shown strong ecological impacts of plant invasions on native plant communities and ecosystem processes. Far fewer studies have examined effects on associated animal communities. From the perspective of a reserve's land management, I addressed the question of whether arthropod assemblages on two nonnative plant species of concern were impoverished compared with those assemblages associated with two predominant native plant species of that reserve. If the nonnative plant species, Conium maculatum L., and Phalaris aquatica L., supported highly depauperate arthropod assemblages compared with the native plant species, Baccharis pilularis De Candolle and Leymus triticoides (Buckley) Pilger, this finding would provide additional support for prioritizing removal of nonnatives and restoration of natives. I assessed invertebrate assemblages at the taxonomic levels of arthropod orders, Coleoptera families, and Formicidae species, using univariate analyses to examine community attributes (richness and abundance) and multivariate techniques to assess arthropod assemblage community composition differences among plant species. Arthropod richness estimates by taxonomic level between native and nonnative vegetation showed varying results. Overall, arthropod richness of the selected nonnative plants, examined at higher taxonomic resolution, was not necessarily less diverse than two of common native plants found on the reserve, although differences were found among plant species. Impacts of certain nonnative plant species on arthropod assemblages may be more difficult to elucidate than those impacts shown on native plants and ecosystem processes.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of ecologists are using molecular gut content assays to qualitatively measure predation. The two most popular gut content assays are immunoassays employing pest-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays employing pest-specific DNA. Here, we present results from the first study to simultaneously use both methods to identify predators of the glassy winged sharpshooter (GWSS), Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). A total of 1,229 arthropod predators, representing 30 taxa, were collected from urban landscapes in central California and assayed first by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a GWSS egg-specific mAb and then by PCR using a GWSS-specific DNA marker that amplifies a 197-base pair fragment of its cytochrome oxidase gene (subunit I). The gut content analyses revealed that GWSS remains were present in 15.5% of the predators examined, with 18% of the spiders and 11% of the insect predators testing positive. Common spider predators included members of the Salticidae, Clubionidae, Anyphaenidae, Miturgidae, and Corinnidae families. Common insect predators included lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), praying mantis (Mantodea: Mantidae), ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), assassin bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), and damsel bugs (Hemiptera: Nabidae). Comparison of the two assays indicated that they were not equally effective at detecting GWSS remains in predator guts. The advantages of combining the attributes of both types of assays to more precisely assess field predation and the pros and cons of each assay for mass-screening predators are discussed.

Both sexes were found throughout the year, but the spider was more abundant during the spring, when females were more numerous.  These spiders took refuge in the nest tumuli of the ants, often entering abandoned turret entrances.  It was not established, however, if the ants abandoned the turrets due to the presence of the spiders.  Corinna vertebrata is a myrmecomorp & a myrmecophage, living in the nests of A. landolti.  In December, 1982, I had the opportunity to visit the site where the initial observations were made.  A. l. fracticornis had been replaced by A. l. balzani (Emery).  Of the 39 colonies examined, only one colony was found to have an associated female of C. vertebrata.  One C. vertebrata was found along the raiding trails of the army ant Labidus praedator (Smith) Paraguay, but was not observed to capture any ants.  Also, Corinna bicalcarata (Simon) has been found to be associated with ants (Gertsch, personal conservation).  This same species has been dug out of Pogonomyrmex nests in the sand dunes of Winterhaven, Imperial Co., California (Roth, personal communication) and collected on the mounds Pogonomyrmex in Las Cruces, New Mexico, by myself.]",

A xenobiotic life cycle, a regular production of intermorphs, and a regressive evolution of the males distinguish the genus in the family. It now includes seven species: two from Eurasia, nitidulus (Nylander) and sibiricus (Forel) comb. nov. & stat. rev. (=orientalis Dlussky), and five from north America, chamberlini (Wheeler) comb. nov., diversipilosus (Smith), hirticornis (Emery), provancheri (Emery) comb. nov. et quebecensis Francoeur sp. nov. Among the last four were traditionally assigned to genera Leptothorax or Symmyrmica. Identification keys are given and illustrated for females and males. The number of species and the geographic distribution of the most primitive forms support a nearctic origin for the genus Formicoxenus which afterwards invaded Eurasia where it further evolved.",

The 1st description of the sexual castes of C. quericicola is provided, together with a guide to distinguish all castes of C. quercicola from similar, sympatric Camponotus species.  We compiled a distribution map based on our own collections and museum specimens.  To test the phylogenetic position of C. quercicola within the North American Camponotus sensu stricto group, we sequenced 385 bp of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I from 9 Camponotus species.  C. quercicola did not form a clade with the North American C. herculeanus species group to which it was previously assigned.

    "abstract": "The biological control program against Tamarix spp. (tamarisk/saltcedar; Tamaricaceae) was initiated in the 1970s to reduce negative impacts of this invasive Old World shrub to riparian biodiversity and ecosystem function in western North America. Field releases of host-specific leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) in the genus Diorhabda were initiated in 2001, with significant establishment and widespread defoliation observed roughly two years after open releases. What followed were a variety of complex interactions among invasive Tamarix, its guild of herbivores including Diorhabda spp., and the physical and biotic environment, which varied across the western U.S. project area. Defoliation yielded sustained lower evapotranspiration and opened canopies, allowing increases in desired vegetation in some areas, while in other areas beetle establishment failed for reasons that included less-suitable host species, mismatches of environmental cues with diapause development of the beetle, and predation by generalist insectivores. In some regions, such as Texas, agent populations were short-lived, resulting in lack of sustained Tamarix suppression. In other areas, beetle populations reached initial epidemic densities but then declined to moderate levels with patchy subsequent defoliation and diminished target mortality. These short-term dramatic impacts to invasive Tamarix, but limited sustained control, suggest potential value in releasing additional host-specific agents, some of which have already been studied and readied for petitioning for release.  This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time and is therefore in the public domain.          *[Ants have been shown to prey on Diorhabda elongata carinulata & disrupt biocontrol efforts.]",

Ants have been found to deter parasitoids of D. eldoradensis, which kill the developing gall-makers.  However, these complex interactions may be influenced by other overlooked factors, such as gall size, gall aggregation, & parasitoid phenology.  Ants that tended control galls were counted & identified to species.  Separately, ants & parasitoids were experimentally excluded.  Sucrose secretion rates were estimated over 8 weeks.  Galls that had ants present were 223% more likely to have gall inducers emerge than galls that had ants excluded in 2018.  However, the presence of ants only increased by 27% in 2019, possibly due to a smaller sample size.  Galls from which parasitoids were excluded had 107% more gall inducers emerge than control galls.  The invasive ant Linepithema humile tended galls had 175% more gall inducers emerge than galls tended by the native Liometopum occidentale ant species, although this result involved relatively few galls.]",

Foraging ant activity peaked during the hotter months of the year. The mean monthly maximum temperature, but not rainfall, positively correlated with indoor infestation frequency. Neither garden size nor the predominant groundcover vegetation correlated with the number of foraging ants at baits within gardens. Although the number of foraging ants outside a building varied over 40-fold, ant density in gardens did not predict the likelihood of infestation within the building. Also, the type of vegetative groundcover employed did not predict infestation frequency. There was, however, a significant negative relationship between the size of the garden outside of a building and the number of infestations. Given the large foraging area of L. humile workers, buildings next to small gardens may be infested simply because they lie within the \"normal\" foraging area of a colony. The best predictor of which rooms were infested within buildings was the presence of a water source. Thus providing water for ant colonies outside and away from buildings may be one method of integrated pest management to reduce the proclivity of ants to infest structures.",

    "abstract": "Parental investment strategies can be fixed or flexible. A fixed strategy predicts making all offspring a single 'optimal' size. Dynamic models predict flexible strategies with more than one optimal size of offspring. Patterns in the distribution of offspring sizes may thus reveal the investment strategy. Static strategies should produce normal distributions. Dynamic strategies should often result in non-normal distributions. Furthermore, variance in morphological traits should be positively correlated with the length of developmental time the traits are exposed to environmental influences. Finally, the type of deviation from normality (i.e., skewed left or right, or platykurtic) should be correlated with the average offspring size. To test the latter prediction, we used simulations to detect significant departures from normality and categorize distribution types. Data from three species of ants strongly support the predicted patterns for dynamic parental investment. Offspring size distributions are often significantly non-normal. Traits fixed earlier in development, such as head width, are less variable than final body weight. The type of distribution observed correlates with mean female dry weight. The overall support for a dynamic parental investment model has implications for life history theory. Predicted conflicts over parental effort, sex investment ratios, and reproductive skew in cooperative breeders follow from assumptions of static parental investment strategies and omnipresent resource limitations. By contrast, with flexible investment strategies such conflicts can be either absent or maladaptive.",

    "abstract": "When populations of native predators are subsidized by numerically dominant introduced species, the structure of food webs can be greatly altered. Surprisingly little is known, however, about the general factors that influence whether or not native predators consume introduced species. To learn more about this issue, we examined how native pit-building ant lions (Myrmeleon) are affected by Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) invasions in coastal southern California. Compared to areas without L. humile, invaded areas contained few native ant species and were deficient in medium-sized and large bodied native ants. Based on these differences, we predicted that Argentine ants would negatively affect ant lion larvae. Contrary to this expectation, observational surveys and laboratory growth rate experiments revealed that Myrmeleon were heavier, had longer mandibles, and grew more quickly when their main ant prey were Argentine ants rather than native ants. Moreover, a field transplant experiment indicated that growth rates and pupal weights were not statistically different for larval ant lions reared in invaded areas compared to those reared in uninvaded areas. Argentine ants were also highly susceptible to capture by larval Myrmeleon. The species-level traits that presumably make Argentine ant workers susceptible to capture by larval ant lions--small size and high activity levels--appear to be the same characteristics that make them unsuitable prey for vertebrate predators, such as horned lizards. These results underscore the difficulties in predicting whether or not numerically dominant introduced species serve as prey for native predators.",

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, is an invasive nuisance, agricultural, and ecological pest from South America. In the United States, its primary distribution is in California and the Southeast. The structural pest control industry responds to property owner complaints when this ants populations become problematic and a persistent nuisance. Actions taken to control Argentine ants in the urban and suburban environment are typically complaint-driven, and often involve the application of insecticide sprays applied to the outdoor environment by professional pest managers. In California, and elsewhere, spray treatments of various residual insecticides by property owners and pest management professionals has resulted in significant runoff and in subsequent surface water contamination. As a result, an immediate need exists to develop alternative methods of ant control targeted at reducing environmental contamination. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential for the development of an alternative method of toxicant delivery focused on the Argentine ant&rsquo;s behavior modifying cuticular chemistry. In short, methanol and hexane washes of Argentine ant pupae applied to paper dummies were handled significantly more by worker ants than the paper dummies that did not contain the solvent extracts. Additionally, paper wicks soaked in a methylene chloride wash from Argentine ant cadavers, air dried, and then treated with fipronil, were removed by worker ants and placed on a midden pile at the same rate (&asymp;86% to 99% removal at 1 h) as untreated and fipronil-treated ant cadavers. The paper wicks that did not contain the methylene chloride extract were ignored by the worker ants. After three days, the mortality of the ants exposed to the fipronil-treated wicks or the ant cadavers were dose-related. In conclusion, our study suggests that there is potential for the use of ant semiochemicals for the delivery of acute toxicants.",

    "abstract": "Time-energy budgets (TEB) of Gambel's Quail (Callipepla gambelii) were compiled during two summers in the Colorado Desert of California. Quail spent 6.77 h/d foraging, 6.2 h/d inactive during daylight hours, and 11.02 h/d inactive at night. Field metabolic rate (FMR) calculated from this activity budget was 81.8 kJ/d. Of this, 47.3 kJ/d was expended during foraging, 12.6 kJ/d in daytime inactivity, and 20.4 kJ/d in nighttime inactivity. Despite the extremely hot thermal environment (maximum ambient temperature ∞45∞C), there was no energy cost above resting levels for thermoregulation. FMR was also measured simultaneously with doubly labeled water (DLW), and averaged 90.8 kJ/d. TEB and DLW values agreed to within 6% when differences in measurement period were taken into account. A laboratory validation study indicated that DLW and balance methods agreed to within 5%. The FMR of C. gambelii was only 40% of that predicted for a bird of its body mass. This low FMR is primarily the result of a low resting metabolic rate (RMR): 51% of the predicted basal rate in 1981, and 70% of predicted in 1982. The basis and significance of this low and variable RMR are unclear. Energy assimilation efficiency, measured in laboratory feeding experiments with a mixed seed and arthropod diet, was 60.3%. An individual quail in the field thus required 150.3 kJ/d in its diet, representing a dry matter intake of 8.1 g/d. A diet of seeds alone provides insufficient water for Gambel's Quail in summer, so they must either incorporate moist food items in their diet or drink free water. It was calculated that over the course of a year, a population of Gambel's Quail consumes seeds with a total energy content ∞15% as great as that in seeds consumed by a population of desert rodents or harvester ants in the same area. Gambel's Quail thus may be important factors in the competition for resources among desert granivores, particularly because they can eat one of their competitors (harvester ants).          *[V. pergandei constituted 5% of the dry mass (20.27 kJ/g energy) from 5 Gambel's quail crops collected in the field.

This variation in social organization is associated with variation at the gene Gp-9, with monogyne colonies harboring only B-like allelic variants and polygyne colonies always containing b-like variants as well. We describe naturally occurring variation at Gp-9 in fire ants based on 185 full-length sequences, 136 of which were obtained from S. invicta collected over much of its native range. While there is little overall differentiation between most of the numerous alleles observed, a surprising amount is found in the coding regions of the gene, with such substitutions usually causing amino acid replacements. This elevated coding-region variation may result from a lack of negative selection acting to constrain amino acid replacements over much of the protein, different mutation rates or biases in coding and non-coding sequences, negative selection acting with greater strength on non-coding than coding regions, and/or positive selection acting on the protein. Formal selection analyses provide evidence that the latter force played an important role in the basal b-like lineages coincident with the emergence of polygyny. While our data set reveals considerable paraphyly and polyphyly of S. invicta sequences with respect to those of other fire ant species, the b-like alleles of the socially polymorphic species are monophyletic. An expanded analysis of colonies containing alleles of this clade confirmed the invariant link between their presence and expression of polygyny. Finally, our discovery of several unique alleles bearing various combinations of b-like and B-like codons allows us to conclude that no single b-like residue is completely predictive of polygyne behavior and, thus, potentially causally involved in its expression. Rather, all three typical b-like residues appear to be necessary.

This represents an important first step into understanding the ties between individual genotypes & colony level expression of social organization.  I have also attempted to show that single nucleotide substitutions at the Gp-9 locus are not sufficiently associated with polygyne behavior, but that several such changes must occur for the expression of the polygyne phenotype.  This raises interesting questions about the validity of the presumed causal role of the b-like alleles at Gp-9 in inducing polygyne behavior in South American fire ants.  Finally, I discuss the state of our current understanding of Gp-9 & its role in regulating social behavior, resulting in a simple, testable model, & suggestions for future avenues of research.]",

    "abstract": "Using natural venom collected from the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, we determined the dose of venom necessary to kill 50% of the workers (LD50) of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile (Mayr), and several other ant species that the fire ant may encounter in California. Of the species tested, the Argentine ant was most susceptible to the venom. On a weight-adjusted basis the red imported fire ant was 330 times more resistant to the venom than the Argentine ant. In addition, the native southern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni McCook, was significantly more susceptible to the venom than S. invicta. Formica perpilosa Wheeler was most resistant to the venom when the LD50 was not adjusted for weight, requiring a dose 684 times higher than that of the Argentine ant. When we tested synthetic venom (solenopsin A, which is the main component of S. xyloni venom) against the Argentine ant, the LD50 value was unchanged. However, both S. invicta and S. xyloni were about 6 times more susceptible to the synthetic compound than to natural venom. Therefore, S. invicta venom is less toxic to fire ants while being just as toxic to Argentine ants as the simpler, more primitive venom of S. xyloni. Fire ant gaster flagging and venom dabbing applies enough venom to the Argentine ant to be lethal and may help explain the superior interference competition shown by the red imported fire ant.",

In a field test, we combined the trail pheromone with a 10% sucrose solution in 50-ml vials. These vials were covered with a plastic membrane that has 1.5-mm-diameter holes punched uniformly across its surface. Ants could drink from the holes after the vials were inverted. For half of the vials, 1 microgram of the pheromone was put onto the plastic membrane before the vials were filled with a 10% sucrose solution. The remaining vials had no pheromone on the plastic membrane. After 4 h we measured the consumption in each vial. Bait consumption with the pheromone was enhanced by 29%.

    "abstract": "The Orange County Vector Control District treats infestations of red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, with two granular baits, Amdro Pro and Distance, at residences with the ant. Some treatments are subcontracted to pestmanagement professionals who received red imported fire ant certification by the Orange County Vector Control District. During this study, we compared four treatment protocols and assessed their efficacy at suppressing red imported fire ants. At the first post-treatment survey at 3 months, homes in three of the protocols received a single treatment of Amdro Pro. Homes in two of the protocols subsequently received either one follow-up treatment with Distance at 3 months or two follow-up treatments with Distance at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Homes in the fourth protocol received a single treatment of a 50:50 mixture of Amdro Pro and Distance. Most reinfestation by red imported fire ants occurred within the first 3 months after the initial treatment, with failure ranging from 29-40%. Although the failure rate was slightly higher for the treatment with the mixture compared to Amdro Pro alone (40 versus 33%, respectively), failure rates did not differ significantly between these treatments. Thereafter and until 9 months later, treatment failures were <10% among residences without red imported fire ants at 3 months. The differences among the protocols were not significant for any of the time periods. At 9 months, there was a small increase in failures compared to 6 months, indicating more red imported fire ants had moved in from surrounding areas or the original colonies were starting to recover. Additional treatments would be necessary to maintain a low level of infestation. We also recorded the identification and frequency of other ant species seen at homes inspected for red imported fire ants.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insecticides are commonly used for ant control around residential homes, but post-treatment runoff may contribute to contamination of surface water in urban watersheds. This study represents the first instance where runoff of insecticides was directly measured after applications around single family residences. During 2007, houses were treated with bifenthrin or fipronil sprays following standard practices. During 2008, pin stream applicators, spray-free zones and restricting sprays to the house foundation were considered as management options.  RESULTS: During 2007, the resulting runoff from the bifenthrin spray in the irrigation water had a mean concentration of 14.9 µg L-1 at 1 week post-treatment and 2.5 µg L-1 at 8 weeks, both high enough to be toxic to sensitive aquatic organisms. In comparison, treatments with bifenthrin granules resulted in no detectable concentrations in the runoff water after 8 weeks. The mean concentration for fipronil used as a perimeter spray was 4.2 µg L-1 at 1 week post-treatment and 0.01 µg L-1 at 8 weeks, with the first value also suggesting a potential for causing acute aquatic toxicity to sensitive organisms. During 2008, insecticide runoff was reduced by using spray-free zones and pin stream perimeter applications.   CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that insecticide runoff from individual home treatments for ants can be measured and used to improve techniques that minimize runoff. The pin stream application and applications limited to the house foundation should be further evaluated for their potential to reduce pesticide runoff from residential homes.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to involve pest management professionals in the design of application techniques and strategies that would be efficacious and also reduce insecticide runoff. Our study involved measuring both the efficacy of treatments for the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), and the concurrent runoff of fipronil and pyrethroids. Two collaborating companies used low-impact protocols for controlling ants while minimizing runoff. Protocol 1 involved bimonthly treatments, while Protocol 2 was monthly. Both protocols involved an initial treatment with a fipronil spray around the foundation. At the garage door-driveway interface, the fipronil application was done as a pin stream for Protocol 1, and as a crack and crevice application in the expansion joint near the garage for Protocol 2. Protocol 1 replaced most pyrethroid sprays with bifenthrin granules placed around bushes and away from the driveway. For the next treatment on day 63, Protocol 1 also included cyfluthrin spray treatments around the house foundation and crack and crevice applications around the edge of the driveway. For the first treatment in Protocol 2, the fipronil spray was supplemented with spot treatments of cyfluthrin. For subsequent Protocol 2 treatments, botanical insecticides were applied. For weeks 1 and 2 posttreatment combined, Protocol 1 had significantly higher reductions in ant numbers compared with Protocol 2. Thereafter there were no significant differences between the protocols. Runoff of bifenthrin from the granules used with Protocol 1 was much lower than in previous trials involving bifenthrin sprays. Day 1 fipronil runoff for Protocol 2 was significantly lower than that for Protocol 1. This difference may be because of the crack and crevice application applied in Protocol 2. Cyfluthrin runoff was minimal for Protocol 2, which involved spot treatments to supplement the fipronil on day 1, or the botanical insecticides for subsequent treatments. Protocol 1 had a large peak of cyfluthrin runoff at day 63 corresponding to their house and driveway treatments.",

    "abstract": "Pest management professionals in California receive more customer complaints about Argentine ants than for any other urban ant pest. Fipronil, applied as a 30 X 30 cm band around the house foundation, has become the preferred treatment used to control these ants. Unfortunately, fipronil is now showing up in urban waterways at levels that are toxic to aquatic invertebrates. Our recent studies are aimed at mitigating insecticide runoff while still controlling the ant infestations. A high priority is preventing fipronil runoff from the driveway to the street, where it can flow into drains and from there to urban waterways. In this paper, two related studies address these issues. Not treating driveways with fipronil reduced by two to three orders of magnitude its runoff when compared with earlier studies. However, not treating the driveway can reduce efficacy of treatments. Granular bifenthrin, indoxacarb, botanicals, and a thiamethoxam ant bait were tested as supplemental treatments. The gel bait showed the best result as a supplement, but only after 8 weeks. We have reduced fipronil runoff while maintaining efficacy of the ant treatments.",

The 2 treated areas and a control were widely separated in the grove. Within each area, trees were randomly selected to receive sucrose water monitors. Consumption of the sucrose water is a measurement of ant foraging activity that we used to compare treatments and the control. For all weekly samples except one, consumption by ants in the imidacloprid-treated area was significantly lower than in the controls. The methoprene treatments gave a more complex outcome: the consumption of the bait was significantly higher than in the controls during wk 5 and 8, but then rapidly descended below the consumption level of the control during wk 11 and 12. A post-experimental examination of the control and methoprene areas showed that queen numbers in the methoprene area were 93% lower than in the control area. A subsequent laboratory experiment comparing the methoprene bait in sucrose to sucrose only showed significant worker mortality after 9, 12, and 16 wk, while at the end of the experiment queen mortality was 24% higher than in the controls (ns). The initial rise in field ant numbers with the methoprene bait would pose a problem for its use by growers unless it would be used early in the season before hot weather would drive the annual increase in ant numbers.",

Moreover, no single class of hydrocarbons was more important than the others in eliciting a response.  Similarly, in the recognition of conspecifics, Linepithema humile did not respond to a mixture of n-alkane cuticular hydrocarbons presented alone, but supplementation of nestmate hydrocarbon profiles with the n-alkanes did elicit high levels of aggression.

    "abstract": "Land\u0010use change from solar energy development may affect desert ecosystems and the soils, plants, and animals therein, yet our understanding of these interactions is nascent. With their ubiquity, criticality as ecosystem constituents, and sensitivity to environmental variation, ants may be useful study organisms for elucidating ecological effects of solar energy development in deserts. Our objectives were to disentangle the response of a desert ant community to solar energy development decisions and test the efficacy of ants as bioindicators at a solar power facility (392\tMW) in the Mojave Desert, USA. We used pitfall traps to collect ants in treatments representing different solar energy development decisions, including variably intense site preparation practices: blading (i.e., bulldozing) and mowing, and establishment of undeveloped patches in solar fields, replicated across three power blocks comprising the facility and in undeveloped control sites surrounding the facility. We determined that ant abundance, species richness, Shannon Diversity Index, and functional richness were lower in bladed treatments than in all other treatments and controls. For most taxonomic and functional ant responses, we detected no difference between nonbladed treatments and controls; these results suggest that less intensive site preparation and increased spatial heterogeneity (i.e., undeveloped patches in solar fields) can reduce the negative effects of solar energy development on desert ants. However, our results indicate that ants may serve as useful bioindicators of the severity of anthropogenic disturbance from solar energy development in deserts, and indicator analysis signifies that solar energy infrastructure may negatively affect some species with high ecological value (e.g., harvester ants). Negative effects of solar energy development on ants can have significant implications for desert ecosystem function and integrity, but conservation\u0010minded solar facility design and construction may lead to avoidance of 'bottom\u0010up' ecological ramifications of increased solar production during the renewable energy transition.

In this study, field and greenhouse experiments were performed that examined how the presence of aphids (Aphis fabae solanella) on Solanum nigrum influenced the foraging behavior of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) and, in turn, modified the extent to which ants deter larval lacewings (Chrysoperla rufilabris), which are known aphid predators. 2. A field experiment demonstrated that the level of foliar foraging by ants increased linearly with aphid abundance, whereas no relationship existed between the level of ground foraging by ants and aphid abundance. 3. In the greenhouse, as in the field, foliar foraging by ants greatly increased when aphids were present. Higher levels of foliar foraging led to a twofold increase in the likelihood that ants contacted aphid predators. As a result of these increased encounters with ants, lacewing larvae were twice as likely to be removed from plants with aphids compared with plants without aphids. Once contact was made, however, the behavior of ants towards lacewing larvae appeared similar between the two experimental groups. 4.  Argentine ants drive away or prey upon a diversity of arthropod predators and parasitoids, but they also exhibit aggression towards certain herbivores. Future work should attempt to quantify how the ecological effects that result from interactions between honeydew-producing insects and invasive ants, such as L. humile, differ from those that result from interactions between honeydew-producing insects and native ants.",

    "abstract": "*[Because carbohydrates serve as a principal metabolic fuel, carbohydrate scarcity may impinge upon behaviors affecting competitive dominance, e.g. aggression, activity, to a greater extent than deficiencies of protein or other nutrients used preferentially for growth.  We tested this prediction with a diet manipulation study involving laboratory colonies of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, a widespread & aggressive invasive species.  The availability of both sucrose & insect prey influenced brood production & worker survival after 3 months.  However, colonies became less aggressive & less active only when deprived of sucrose, but not prey.  Also, scarcity of sucrose, but not prey, was associated with reduced fat mass in individual workers.  These data provide the first experimental support that carbohydrate scarcity compromises aggression & activity in ants.  In principle, they illustrate how access to carbohydrate-rich resources (e.g. plant exudates, hemipteran honeydew) might influence behavioral investments that contribute to competitive performance.  Such investments might be especially important for invasive ants, given their aggressiveness & tendency to interact with honeydew-producing Hemiptera.]",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary ecologists often seek to explain life history variation at geographical scales. Progress in this regard has been slower in social insects than in unitary organisms, due in part to limited information about species distributions and the complexity of studying colony-level traits. Temnothorax ants have proven useful for investigating associations between ecology and life history traits in ants, because they have small colonies (<200 workers) with substantial variation in traits like queen number within and across populations. Yet most of these studies have focused on <10 Temnothorax species from northern latitudes, although the genus contains >400 species that range from temperate to tropical biomes. Here, we generate the first global map of Temnothorax diversity and demonstrate that previous ecological hypotheses for colony life history variation in the genus are based on data and studies confined to a small part of the overall genus-level distribution. For example, studies of northern-latitude species have suggested that overwintering success is a prominent selective force favoring polygyny but little is known about polygyny in Temnothorax species from other regions. We report the highest observed queen numbers known in the genus in the subtropical species T. tuscaloosae and confirm that all queens in these polygynous colonies are mated and actively laying eggs. Behavioral laboratory experiments further indicate that this species has a fluid nest structure and lacks intraspecific aggression at the whole-forest scale. These results extend the biogeographical extent of life history studies for this genus and point to evolutionary discoveries awaiting comparative research of the global Temnothorax fauna.

    "abstract": "1. Vine mealybug Planococcus ficus is an invasive pest of vineyards in many areas of the world. In California, USA, it infests all plant subunits and has a spatial refuge from natural enemies under the bark and on roots. A temporal refuge is created when ants tending the mealybug reduce the efficacy of natural enemies. 2. Biological control of vine mealybug is only partially successful and varies among California grape-growing regions. To improve control and help determine appropriate natural enemies for importation, the effects of weather on mealybug regulation by two parasitoids, Anagyrus pseudococci and Leptomastidea abnormis, and a coccinellid predator, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, were examined across the ecological regions of California. 3. Weather-driven, physiologically based age-mass structured demographic models of the mealybug and its natural enemies were parameterized using laboratory data and field observations. Temperature was used to define the thermal limits and development rates of each species, and resource supply/demand ratios were used to scale daily per capita growth, fecundity and survivorship rates from maximal values at optimal conditions. 4. The population dynamics of the mealybug and its natural enemies were simulated at 108 locations in California over a 10-year period using observed weather. The simulation data were mapped using a geographical information system (GIS) and analysed using linear multiple regression and marginal analysis. 5. The models predictions indicated that: (i) the parasitoid A. pseudococci has a larger impact on vine mealybug than either L. abnormis or C. montrouzieri; (ii) mealybug densities will be lowest in the hot desert regions of southern California and highest in the cooler areas of northern California; (iii) mealybug density increases with season length and the size of the combined spatial-temporal refuge; (iv) biological control of mealybug could be achieved by reducing the size of the spatial-temporal refuge. 6. Synthesis and applications. Models, no matter how detailed, will always be incomplete; despite this, the complexity of tri-trophic systems can be modelled and the effects of biotic factors and of weather separated. The predictions of our model coincided well with field observations on vine mealybug, and clearly showed why the biological control will require additional species of natural enemies and/or why the size of the spatial and temporal refuges must be reduced.",

    "abstract": "Globally, many invasive alien species have caused extensive ecological and economic damage from either accidental or intentional introduction. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, has created billions of dollars in costs annually, spreading as an invasive species across the southern United States. In 1998, the red imported fire ant spread into California creating a highly probable future introduction via shipped products to Hawaii. This paper presents the estimation of potential economic impacts of the red imported fire ant (RIFA) to the state of Hawaii. Evaluation of impacts focuses on the economic sectors of (1)households, (2) agriculture (cattle and crop production), (3) infrastructure (cemeteries, churches, cities, electrical, telephone, and cable services, highways, hospitals and schools), (4) recreation, tourism and business (hotels/resort areas, golf courses, commercial businesses and tourists), and (5) government expenditures (with minimal intervention). The full annual economic costs of the red imported fire ant to Hawaii are estimated (in US$ 2006) to be $211 million/year, comprised of $77 million in damages and expenditures and $134 million in foregone outdoor opportunities to households and tourists. The present value of the projected costs of RIFA over a 20-year period after introduction total $2.5 billion. RIFA invasions across the globe indicate that economic cost-effective action in Hawaii entails implementation of prevention, early detection and rapid response treatment programs for RIFA.

To assess the relationships between cooperation and environment, we examined variation in colony reproductive success for a harvester ant species that nests either solitarily or with multiple, unrelated queens, a social strategy known as primary polygyny. We measured the reproductive investment of colonies of solitary versus social nesting types at two sites, one with primarily single-queen colonies, and the other with a majority of polygynous nests. Our results were consistent with the hypothesis that cooperative nesting by unrelated ant queens is likely a selection response to difficult environments, rather than a strategy to maximize reproduction under favorable conditions. Fewer colonies at the primarily polygynous site reproduced than at the site with primarily single queen nests, and those that did had lower reproductive investment, as measured by number and total mass of reproductives. Assessment of ecological conditions also support the harsh environment hypothesis. Colony density in the multi-queen population was higher, and nearest neighbor distances were lower for non-reproducing than reproducing colonies. To more directly test the hypothesis that colony reproduction was ecologically constrained, we experimentally supplemented food resources for a subset of colonies at the primary polygyny site. Supplemented colonies increased reproductive investment levels to equal that of colonies at the single-queen population, further indicating that environmental pressures are severe where primary polygyny is dominant, and may drive the evolution of non-kin cooperation in this context.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation between kin and cooperation between non-kin often appear functionally similar, but the evolutionary mechanisms that drive the emergence of these two forms of cooperation can be dramatically different. The mechanisms responsible for non-kin cooperation, in particular, are not well established in an empirical context. To truly understand the emergence of non-kin cooperation, the fitness outcomes of cooperation should be compared with the alternate strategy of solitary living in the same environment. Ant populations that contain a mix of queens who found nests alone (monogyny), and cooperative unrelated ant queens who found nests together and remain together through colony development (primary polygyny), provide a useful natural context to make such a comparison. To estimate the reproductive costs for primary polygyny relative to solitary nest founding, we measured alate (reproductive) production for colonies in a mixed population of polygynous and monogynous California harvester ant colonies over a 2-year period. Colony-level reproductive output was not substantially higher in polygynous colonies compared to those with single queens, and consequent per-queen reproductive gain was significantly lower. Given that polygynous queens in this population are unrelated, nest sharing thus generates a significant annual and potentially lifetime cost for cooperative queens. Comparative measures of colony dynamics, however, suggest that polygynous colonies have a larger or more active workforce than monogynous colonies. Additionally, polygynous colonies may be more conservative than monogynous colonies in resource allocation towards reproduction. These results collectively suggest that primary polygyny generates annual reproductive fitness costs. However, polygynous colonies likely also shift life history strategies in ways that emphasize long-term survival and colony growth over immediate reproduction. Over time, this shift may mitigate the annual fitness costs of cooperation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: When things get difficult, it pays to work together. In some ant species, unrelated queens form long-term cooperative associations that share resources and a workforce within a single nest. The fitness consequences and evolutionary drivers of non-kin cooperation in this and other systems are unclear. We compared the reproductive investment and colony dynamics of single-queen and multi-queen California harvester ant colonies in a shared environment to directly compare the fitness of cooperative and non-cooperative queens. Our data suggest that cooperation not only lowers annual per-queen reproduction, but also produces a more robust colony that may recoup annual fitness losses by extending colony longevity.",

    "abstract": "Ants often visit flowers, but have only seldom been documented to provide effective pollination services. Floral visitation by ants can also compromise plant reproduction in situations where ants interfere with more effective pollinators. Introduced ants may be especially likely to reduce plant reproductive success through floral visitation, but existing experimental studies have found little support for this hypothesis. Here, we combine experimental and observational approaches to examine the importance of floral visitation by the nonnative Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) on plant species native to Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. First, we determine how L. humile affects floral visitor diversity, bee visitation rates, and levels of pollen limitation for the common, focal plant species island morning glory (Calystegia macrostegia ssp. macrostegia). Second, we assess the broader ecological consequences of floral visitation by L. humile by comparing floral visitation networks between invaded and uninvaded sites. The Argentine ant and native ants both visited island morning glory flowers, but L. humile was much more likely to behave aggressively towards other floral visitors and to be the sole floral occupant. The presence of L. humile in morning glory flowers reduced floral visitor diversity, decreased rates of bee visitation, and increased levels of pollen limitation. Network comparisons between invaded and uninvaded sites revealed differences in both network structure and species\u0010level attributes. In invaded sites, floral visitors were observed on fewer plant species, ants had a higher per\u0010plant interaction strength relative to that of other visitors, and interaction strengths between bees and plants were weaker. These results illustrate that introduced ants can negatively affect plant reproduction and potentially disrupt pollination services at an ecosystem scale.",

    "abstract": "Invasions give rise to a wide range of ecological effects. Many invasions proceed without noticeable impacts on the resident biota, whereas others shift species composition and even alter ecosystem function. Ant invasions generate a broad spectrum of ecological effects, but controversy surrounds the extent of these impacts, especially with regard to how other arthropods are affected. This uncertainty in part results from the widespread use of low\u0010resolution taxonomic data, which can mask the presence of other introduced species and make it difficult to isolate the effects of ant invasions on native species. Here, we use high\u0010resolution taxonomic data to examine the effects of Argentine ant invasions on arthropods on Santa Cruz Island, California. We sampled arthropods in eight pairs of invaded and uninvaded plots and then collaborated with taxonomic experts to identify taxa in four focal groups: spiders, bark lice, beetles, and ants. Spiders, bark lice, and beetles made up ~40% of the 9868 non\u0010ant arthropod individuals sampled; the majority of focal group arthropods were putatively native taxa. Although our results indicate strong negative effects of the Argentine ant on native ants, as is well documented, invaded and uninvaded plots did not differ with respect to the richness, abundance, or species composition of spiders, bark lice, and beetles. One common, introduced species of bark louse was more common in uninvaded plots than in invaded plots, and including this species into our analyses changed the relationship between bark louse richness vs. L. humile abundance from no relationship to a significant negative relationship. This case illustrates how failure to differentiate native and introduced taxa can lead to erroneous conclusions about the effects of ant invasions. Our results caution against unqualified assertions about the effects of ant invasions on non\u0010ant arthropods, and more generally demonstrate that accurate assessments of invasion impacts depend on adequate information about species identity.",

    "abstract": "1. Although plant invasions often reduce insect abundance and diversity, non\u0010native plants that support phytophagous insects can subsidise higher trophic levels via elevated herbivore abundance. 2. Here ant-aphid interactions on non\u0010native fennel on Santa Cruz Island, California are examined. Fennel hosts abundant, honeydew\u0010producing fennel aphids. The patchiness of fennel and the relative lack of honeydew\u0010producing insects on other plants at our study sites suggest that assimilation of fennel\u0010derived honeydew would increase the abundance and decrease the trophic position of the omnivorous, aphid\u0010tending Argentine ant. 3. To assess the strength of the ant-aphid interaction, a comparison of ant abundance on and adjacent to fennel prior to and 3 weeks after experimental aphid removal was performed. Compared with control plants with aphids, ants declined in abundance on and around fennel plants following aphid removal. At the habitat scale, pitfall traps in fennel\u0010dominated habitats captured more ants than in fennel\u0010free scrub habitats. 4. To determine if assimilation of aphid\u0010produced honeydew reduces the ant's trophic position, variation in ¥15N values among ants, plants and other arthropods was analysed. Unexpectedly, ¥15N values for ants in fennel\u0010dominated habitats were higher than those of arthropod predators from the same sites and also higher than those of ants from fennel\u0010free habitats. 5. Our results illustrate how introduced plants that support phytophagous insects appear to transfer energy to higher trophic levels via elevated herbivore abundance. Although assimilation of fennel\u0010derived honeydew did not appear to reduce consumer trophic position, spatial variation in alternative food resources might obscure contributions from honeydew.",

For pupae but not larvae, this difference was removed by using tanglefoot to repel nonflying predators.  However, the major nonflying predator of pupae, the ant Formica lasioides, was no more abundant in non-outbreak areas than in the outbreak area. We found inverse density-dependence in the rate of attack by F. lasioides on experimental pupae, suggesting this generalist predator is satiated within the outbreak area, but preys more heavily on the moth where the moth is sparse.

In small propagules of 10-1,000 workers, brood production increased with worker number but not queen number.   In contrast, percapita measures of colony growth decreased with worker number over these colony sizes.   In larger propagules of 1,000-11,000 workers, brood production also increased with increasing worker number, but per capita brood production appeared independent of colony size.   Our results suggest that queens need workers to establish successfully but that propagules with as few as 10 workers can grow quickly.]",

    "abstract": "In the ant genus Cardiocondyla, wingless, ergatoid males occur instead of or in addition to winged males. Winged males behave peacefully similar to the males of other ant species, but ergatoid males attack and kill rival ergatoid males with their strong mandibles and attempt to monopolize mating with all young queens that emerge in their maternal nest. Both ergatoid and winged males are capable of a surprisingly high number of inseminations (more than 40). Sperm supply appears to be depleted in old winged males but ergatoid males are still capable of successfully copulating with queens only one or two days before their death. Histological studies have shown that spermatogenesis continues throughout the whole life of ergatoid males but stops in winged males between three and eight days after eclosion. Ergatoid males transfer on average more sperm into the queen's spermatheca than winged males.  (abstract provided by book author)",

It was investigated how the proportion of polygynous colonies varies along an elevation gradient from 60 to 2700\tm in the Nearctic ant Temnothorax rugatulus (Emery).  2. Across all populations, the proportion of polygynous colonies was positively correlated with altitude. The correlation was considerably stronger when only populations in the narrow area of the Chiricahua Mts, Arizona, were compared.  3. The dominance of polygynous colonies at high altitudes may be associated with selection against solitary colony founding by young queens. In areas with short summers and long winters, hibernation mortality of solitarily founding queens may select for alternative reproductive tactics, such as polygyny and colony founding by budding.  4. Colony founding tactics need to be taken into account to more fully understand altitudinal and latitudinal patterns of ant faunas.",

Colony organization and movement behavior of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) was studied over 3 years in field populations in California and in captive colonies in the laboratory. This invasive species is highly polydomous and unicolonial; colonies consist of expansive and fluid networks of nests and trails. The spatial and temporal organization of colonies may contribute to ecological dominance. 2. Argentine ant nests and inter-nest trails shift in size, abundance, and location, so that colony networks are spatially contracted in the winter and expanded spring to autumn. Colonies occupy permanent sites; ants migrated to and from the same winter nest locations year after year, and occupied 30% of the same nests repeatedly during seasonal migrations. 3. Nests were moved on average 2-3 m. Forty-two per cent were occupied less than 1 month, 4% the entire study, and the other 54% lasted 3.9 +- 2.3 months (mean +- SD). 4. Nests were located within 2-4 m of woody plants, in warm sites in the winter and cool sites in the summer. Both humidity and food availability influenced nest-site choice in laboratory colonies. However, when faced with a trade-off between factors, the ants chose humid nest boxes over nest boxes near food, and ants moved nests only in response to changes in humidity and not distance to food. 5. The results indicate that L. humile colonies are seasonally polydomous, and that nest movements are driven by changes in microclimate. Colony organization maintains high local density and increases food supply, which may improve the competitive ability of L. humile colonies and reduce opportunities for species coexistence.",

    "abstract": "Unicolonial ant colonies occupy many nests and individuals rarely show aggression across large geographic distances. These traits make it difficult to detect colony structure. Here we identify colony structure at scales of hundreds of square-meters, within an invasive population of unicolonial Argentine ants. In experiments using labeled food, and in a 3-year census of nests and trails, we found that food was shared and nests were linked by trails at distances up to 50 meters. Food was not distributed to all nearby Argentine ant nests, showing that ants tend to share resources within a spatially bounded group of nests. The spatial extent of food sharing increased from winter to summer. Across different habitats and nest densities, nests were consistently aggregated at spatial scales of 3- 4 meters in radius. This suggests that new nests bud from old nests at short distances regardless of local conditions. We suggest that a 'colony' of Argentine ants could be defined as a group of nests among which ants travel and share food. In our study population, colonies occupy up to 650 m2 and contain as many as 5 million ants. In combination with previous work showing that there is genetic differentiation among nests at similar spatial scales, the results suggest that Argentine ant populations do not function ecologically as single, large supercolonies, but instead as mosaics of smaller, distinct colonies consisting of groups of interacting nests.",

    "abstract": "Climate change may exacerbate invasions by making conditions more favorable to introduced species relative to native species. Here we used data obtained during a long-term biannual survey of the distribution of ant species in a 481-ha preserve in northern California to assess the influence of interannual variation in rainfall on the spread of invasive Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, and the displacement of native ant species. Since the survey began in 1993, Argentine ants have expanded their range into 74 new hectares. Many invaded hectares were later abandoned, so the range of Argentine ants increased in some years and decreased in others. Rainfall predicted both range expansion and interannual changes in the distribution of Argentine ants: high rainfall, particularly in summer months, promoted their spread in the summer. This suggests that an increase in rainfall will promote a wider distribution of Argentine ants and increase their spread into new areas in California. Surprisingly, the distribution of two native ant species also increased following high rainfall, but only in areas of the preserve that were invaded by L. humile. Rainfall did not have a negative impact on total native ant species richness in invaded areas. Instead, native ant species richness in invaded areas increased significantly over the 13 years of observation. This suggests that the impact of Argentine ants on naÔve ant communities may be most severe early in the invasion process.",

    "abstract": "A key requirement for social cooperation is the mitigation and/or social regulation of aggression towards other group members. Populations of the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus show the alternate social phenotypes of queens founding nests alone (haplometrosis) or in groups of unrelated yet cooperative individuals (pleometrosis). Pleometrotic queens display an associated reduction in aggression. To understand the proximate drivers behind this variation, we placed foundresses of the two populations into social environments with queens from the same or the alternate population, and measured their behaviour and head gene expression profiles. A proportion of queens from both populations behaved aggressively, but haplometrotic queens were significantly more likely to perform aggressive acts, and conflict escalated more frequently in pairs of haplometrotic queens. Whole\u0010head RNA sequencing revealed variation in gene expression patterns, with the two populations showing moderate differentiation in overall transcriptional profile, suggesting that genetic differences underlie the two founding strategies. The largest detected difference, however, was associated with aggression, regardless of queen founding type. Several modules of coregulated genes, involved in metabolism, immune system and neuronal function, were found to be upregulated in highly aggressive queens. Conversely, nonaggressive queens exhibited a striking pattern of upregulation in chemosensory genes. Our results highlight that the social phenotypes of cooperative vs. solitary nest founding tap into a set of gene regulatory networks that seem to govern aggression level. We also present a number of highly connected hub genes associated with aggression, providing opportunity to further study the genetic underpinnings of social conflict and tolerance.",

The desert seed-harvester ant, Messor pergandei, shows regional variation in the incidence of pleometrosis. I investigated whether there are ecological differences between the two regions that may explain the observed behavioral divergence. Pleometrosis was significantly associated with reduced precipitation, lower vegetation biomass, and lower adult colony density. These differences are consistent with the hypothesis that additional worker production in group colonies increases foraging success rather than competitive ability. The data also suggest an additional hypothesis, desiccation resistance, that should be explored. Annual variability within regions was high and far exceeded the magnitude of the differences seen between regions. Future laboratory and field experiments should take such variability into account.",

    "abstract": "The desert seed-harvester ant Messor pergandei shows sharp regional differences in social structure: in central Arizona, queens initially form group nests but become aggressive following worker emergence and reduce to a single queen (secondary monogyny). In much of the rest of the species range, however, co-founding queens do not display aggression and retain multiple queens throughout the colony lifecycle (primary polygyny). One hypothesis to explain why queen behavior differs between regions is that relatedness among co-foundresses and, therefore, the potential for kin-selected cooperation, varies geographically. To test whether primary polygyny is associated with greater kin association, we used highly polymorphic microsatellites to estimate within-group relatedness for co-foundress associations in the field at two secondarily monogynous sites and five primarily polygynous sites. To determine whether queens can potentially use nestmate identity as a proxy for genetic relatedness, we compared these values to similarly sized samples of worker nestmates from adult colonies at the same sites. We found that foundresses do not preferentially form groups with relatives regardless of the ultimate fate of foundress groups. Mean relatedness values for co-foundresses did not differ significantly from zero irrespective of social structure. In contrast, adult colony worker nestmates were significantly positively related at all sites. These results indicate that kin-selected benefits are not likely to be responsible for the absence of fatal competition in the polygynous region; instead, the cause of geographic variation in queen cooperation must lie in ecological factors that alter the costs and benefits of retaining additional queens into colony maturity.",

Across the range of the desert seed-harvester ant, Messor pergandei, daughter queens use three different social strategies during colony founding that are expected to alter the optimal level of parental investment. To test whether social strategy variation is associated with shifts in body mass, we surveyed queen live mass over 3 years at 25 sites that spanned the range of behavioral strategies and founding group sizes. To test whether reduction in parental investment into individual offspring negatively impacts their productivity, queens were individually isolated and allowed to produce a single worker cohort under common garden conditions. Queen live mass was highly variable, from 24 mg on average at the site with the lightest queens to 1.5 times that size, 37 mg, at the site with the heaviest queens. As predicted by parent-offspring conflict over investment, solitary colony founding sites contained the heaviest queens, followed by secondary monogyny. Polygynous queens were lightest, with a strong negative relationship between group size and live mass. Reductions in body mass had a negative effect on queen productivity across all queen social types; however, queens from sites where queen-queen aggression is typical were significantly more efficient at brood rearing, resulting in lower mass loss during founding per unit offspring biomass.

In parts of the Sonoran & Mojave deserts, however, summer rain is largely absent & most precipitation occurs during the winter & early spring.  We observed a mating flight of P. rugosus at a western Mojave Desert location in late winter, 4 to 6 months earlier than reported for other areas.  In this portion of their range, P. rugosus must either produce alates for summer flights & then over-winter them for late-winter to early-spring flights, when summer precipitation is insufficient, or else they have fully converged on the mating-flight patterns of other desert species dependent upon winter & early spring rains.]",

    "abstract": "To determine the extent and geographical distribution of alternative social systems in the desert ant Messor pergandei, we conducted a large-scale study within the species' range in the United States. We found that that queen social behaviours are extraordinarily diverse, resulting in three distinct colony social systems distributed in different geographical regions. Experiments show that these differences arise from variation in queen behaviours at two distinct times in the colony life cycle, and are likely to result from underlying genetic differences between regions. Results from our population genetics analyses and the biogeography of the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts suggest that the different queen social behaviours may have evolved in previously isolated populations, with their current distributions explained in part by subsequent range expansions rather than local adaptation in situ. However, regions with alternative social forms currently meet in contact zones where gene flow and natural selection on alternative social systems should occur. The degree of geographical variation in social behaviours exhibited by M. pergandei results in an opportunity to study the role that gene flow, local adaptation, genetic drift and past history can play in the evolution of behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The fate of queen foundress associations in ants varies across taxa: in some, lethal fighting results in survival of a single queen, while in others, queens coexist long term. One hypothesis for this difference is that selection favors fighting when group sizes are small and tolerance when groups are large. In an experiment with the ant Messor pergandei, we formed small, medium, and large groups with newly mated queens from field populations that have different mean group sizes and differ in whether multiple queens occur in older established colonies. We found that whether queens are eliminated by fighting depends upon region of origin and not group size: regardless of co-foundress number, queens from sites with single-queen adult field colonies displayed agonistic behaviors and their colonies reduced to a single queen, while queens from sites with multiple-queen colonies did not fight and co-foundresses coexisted long term. Worker aggression towards and elimination of queens were also correlated with region of origin. Where fighting occurred, queens were as likely to be killed by workers as by other queens. An aggressive display was the most common form of agonistic interaction among queens, while fighting was relatively rare. We hypothesize that queen displays evolved in response to worker attacks because they increase the probability that workers will eliminate competitor queens. Our results suggest that the evolutionary interests of workers, as well as queens, could be important in determining the evolution and maintenance of queen elimination in foundress associations.",

Additionally, castor bean petioles and inflorescences have extra floral nectary (EFN) glands that secrete sugars that also attract ants, which in return, defend against herbivores. We propose that in order to attract ants, castor bean would have to balance allocation of energy toward plant defense and seed dispersal per the Principle of Allocation. Specifically, we hypothesized that in castor bean, an increase in elaiosome size would correspond to result in a decrease in EFN gland size. We examined proportion of elaiosome:seed (by weight) investment relative to the EFN gland size on a given castor bean plant. We found that elaiosome weight was not correlated with EFN gland area (p = 0.1542), and report a one to five fold range in elaiosome investment across 34 plants. We present a range of environmental factors contributing to the observed variation in elaiosome investment.",

Ants forage intensively during morning & evening sessions in areas surrounding nests.  Activity is at its most intense in early summer, coinciding with peak seed release for most annual plant species.   Ants show strong preferences for seeds of non-dominant species, notably Microseris douglasii (DC.) Sch.-Bip., but preferences alter over the season in response to seed availability.  Seeds of the dominant annual species, Lasthenia californica DC ex Lindley are not foraged until later in the summer, when seeds of other species are less abundant.  Seedling densities & species compositions on ant nests differ markedly from surrounding areas, with species relative abundances being similar to those found on gopher mounds.  An exclosure experiment in areas adjacent to nests indicated that ants significantly reduced the densities of species with preferred seeds.  Ants may therefore significantly affect plant distribution & abundance within the serpentine grassland.]",

In the early summer, foragers consumed more of the same types of foods during the day & at night.  Even though workers are polymorphic, they all consumed about 0.25 mg of a 25% sucrose solution, providing a mechanism of determining foraging activity by measuring sugar water removal from monitoring stations.  Baits containing 25% sucrose would be effective if suitable toxicants can be identified.  Liometopum luctuosum is restricted to the coniferous forests in the mountains in the southern range of its distribution, suggesting that it may be less xeric adapted than L. occidentale.  When exposed the various temperatures & relative humidities, L. luctuosum workers survived significantly longer than L. occidentale.  Furthermore, L. luctuosum lost significantly more water over 24 h than did L. occidentale at 25.6-degrees-C & 33.0-degrees-C.  The cuticular permeability of L. luctuosum was 17.8 & 19.1, while cuticular permeability of L. occidentale was 17.0 & 19.8 at 25.3-degrees-C & 33-degrees-C.  The similarity of the cuticular permeabilities & the comparison of the effect of saturation deficit on survival indicated that water loss alone through the cuticle was probably not the major factor affecting survival.  A segment of the mitochondrial (mtDNA) COI gene was used to determine that L. occidentale nest contain either one queen or multiple maternally related queens.  Observations of the behaviors displayed by workers from colonies separated in an urban landscape showed, that there is a slight but significant correlation between geographic distance & their level of aggression.]",

Antigens similar to 3 of the 4 known S. invicta venom proteins (I, II, III, and IV) were isolated from S. richteri.  The  n-terminal amino acid sequences for the antigens III were identical, but those for the antigens II demonstrated only 9 of 20 residues to be identical. Two monoclonal antibodies raised against S. invicta II did not react to S. richteri.  No protein IV could be detected in S. richteri by molecular weight, charge, or immunologically with either polyclonal mouse antibodies or 5 monoclonal antibodies.  Both venoms were compared with a panel of 60 sera from S. invicta-allergic individuals & mean bindings were similar with an r = 0.94 for linear regression.  RAST inhibition was performed with 17 individual sera representing a variety of S. invicta allergen specificities.  Four sera were tested from patients resident in the S. richteri endemic area & 5 sera from patients who experienced reactions to S. xyloni stings.  All sera reacted comparably to both imported fire ant venoms.  The 2 venoms appear to be allergenically similar, although antigen IV is absent from S. richteri & the antigens II have significant sequence variation.  S. invicta venom appears to be sufficient for diagnostic purposes.]",

    "abstract": "Argentine ants, Linepithema humile (Mayr), form mutualisms with hemipteran pests in crop systems. In vineyards, they feed on honeydew produced by mealybugs and soft scales, which they tend and protect from natural enemies. Few options for controlling Argentine ants are available; one of the more effective approaches is to use liquid baits containing a low dose of an insecticide. Knowledge of ant foraging patterns is required to estimate how many bait stations to deploy per unit area. To measure how far ants move liquid bait in vineyards, we placed bait stations containing sugar water and a protein marker in plots for 6 d, and then collected ants along transects extending away from bait stations. Ants moved an average of 16.08 m and 12.21 m from bait stations in the first and second years of the study, respectively. Marked ants were found up to 63 m from bait stations; however, proportions of marked ants decreased exponentially as distance from the bait station increased. Results indicate that Argentine ants generally forage at distances <70 m in California vineyards, thus suggesting that insecticide bait stations must be deployed at intervals of <70 m to control ants. We found no effect of insecticide on distances that ants moved the liquid bait, but this may have been because bait station densities were too low to affect the high numbers of Argentine ants that were present at the study sites.

    "abstract": "Colony size is a fundamental attribute of insect societies that appears to play an important role in their organization of work. In the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus, division of labor increases with colony size during colony ontogeny and among unmanipulated colonies of the same age. However, the mechanism(s) integrating individual task specialization and colony size is unknown. To test whether the scaling of division of labor is an emergent epiphenomenon, as predicted by self-organizational models of task performance, we manipulated colony size in P. californicus and quantified short-term behavioral responses of individuals and colonies. Variation in colony size failed to elicit a change in division of labor, suggesting that colony-size effects on task specialization are mediated by slower developmental processes and/or correlates of colony size that were missing from our experiment. In contrast, the proportional allocation of workers to tasks shifted with colony size, suggesting that task needs or priorities depend, in part, on colony size alone. Finally, although task allocation was flexible, colony members differed consistently in task performance and spatial tendency across colony size treatments. Sources of interindividual behavioral variability include worker age and genotype (matriline).",

We sought to determine the relative contributions of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates to diversity and abundance in these wetlands, the extent to which terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate assemblages differ with wetland type, and to what degree the aquatic assemblages vary as a function of slow sheet flow. We compared assemblages in fens and wet meadows, with and without flow, at 80 backcountry sites dispersed across the 6200 km2 landscape of Yosemite, Sequoia,and Kings Canyon National Parks in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California,U.S.A., using standard aquatic and terrestrial sweep netting. Cicadellid leafhoppers, aphids, and thomisid crab spiders were the most abundant terrestrial taxa. Cicadellids,Lepidoptera, anthomyiid, muscid, chloropid, and ephydrid flies, and thomisids were more abundant in fens than in wet meadows. Only mirid leaf bugs were significantly more abundant in wet meadows than fens. Sphaeriid clams and chironomid midges dominated aquatic assemblages both with and without flow. Chloroperlid stoneflies, mites, clams, and flatworms were all more abundant in flow, and Hemiptera and mosquitos were significantly more abundant in quiescent water. Mosquitos were more abundant in wet meadows, but there were few other population differences as a functionof wetland type. Terrestrial diversity was 1.1 to 2.0 times that of aquatic diversity,depending on metric and habitat. Fens had greater terrestrial abundance, richness,evenness, and diversity than wet meadows; there were fewer differences as a function of wetland type for aquatic fauna. Presence or absence of slow sheet flow had more effect on these aquatic assemblages than did wetland type. Cluster analyses, ordination, and multi-response permutation procedures were generally consistent with the univariate results. Vegetation-based wetland classifications should be extrapolated to faunal assemblages with caution, particularly for aquatic invertebrates.

A priori predictors of rate of invasion included stream flow (= a measure of abiotic suitability), disturbance, & native ant richness.  In addition, baits were used to estimate the abundance of Argentine ants & native ants at the 20 sites.  A multiple regression model accounted for nearly half of the variation in mean rate of invasion, but stream flow was the only significant factor in this analysis.  Argentine ants spread, on average, 16-m year-1 at sites with permanent stream flow & retreated, on average, -6-m year-1 at sites with intermittent stream flow.  Rate of invasion was independent of both disturbance & native ant richness.  Argentine ants recruited to more baits in higher numbers in invaded areas than did native ants in uninvaded areas.

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is a widespread invasive species that competitively displaces native ants throughout its introduced range. Although this pattern of displacement is well known, its underlying mechanisms remain little studied. To gain a more detailed understanding of this widespread competitive displacement, I compared the exploitative and interference abilities of the Argentine ant with those of seven species of native ants it displaces in riparian woodlands in northern California. I performed four different manipulative field experiments; each measured different aspects of the competitive ability of the eight species of ants in this study. The main goals of this study were to identify the mechanisms responsible for the Argentine ant\u0019s strong competitive ability, to determine if native ants are subject to species\u0010specific trade\u0010offs in exploitative and interference ability typically present among coexisting ants, and if so, to assess whether Argentine ants are subject to this trade\u0010off as well. Argentine ants located and recruited to baits as quickly or more quickly than did native ants\u0014both in areas where Argentine ants and native ants occurred together (i.e., at the edge of invasion fronts) and where they occurred separately (i.e., away from invasion fronts). Along the edge of invasion fronts, Argentine ants also controlled a greater proportion of baits than did native ants. In one\u0010on\u0010one interactions, individual Argentine ant workers experienced mixed success in overcoming individual workers of the seven native ant species. When fighting against native ants, Argentine ants used both physical aggression and chemical defensive compounds, although the latter mechanism was more often successful in deterring opponents. Chemical defensive compounds produced by Argentine ants were repellent but appeared no more so than those of native ants. Although Argentine ant workers were not able to overcome native ant workers consistently, Argentine ant colonies succeeded in displacing most native ant colonies from baits. The discrepancy between worker\u0010level and colony\u0010level interference ability suggests that numerical advantages are key to the Argentine ant\u0019s proficiency at interference competition. Like ants in other communities, the native ants in this study were subject to a competitive trade\u0010off in which interference ability and exploitative ability were negatively correlated. In contrast, Argentine ants were proficient at both exploitative and interference competition relative to the native ants they displaced and are thus removed from this trade\u0010off. These findings imply that Argentine ants secure a majority of available food resources where this species comes into contact with native ants. Argentine ants may be able to break the competitive trade\u0010off constraining native ants because of their unique colony structure and because they have escaped their natural enemies. The observation that Argentine ants are uncoupled from the competitive trade\u0010off constraining native ants may provide a general explanation for patterns of dominance within ant communities and for the success of other introduced species.",

Reductions in the diversity & abundance of native ants resulting from ant invasions give rise to a variety of direct and indirect effects on non-ant taxa.  Invasive ants compete with and prey upon a diversity of other organisms, including some vertebrates, and may enter into or disrupt mutualistic interactions with numerous plants and other insects.

The loss of native ants following invasion by Argentine ants homogenizes these faunas; i.e. natural habitats invaded by L. humile have lower beta diversity compared to uninvaded areas.  Argentine ant abundance in the seasonally dry mediterranean environments of this region correlates strongly & positively with soil moisture.  For this reason, the displacement of native ants across natural & artificial moisture gradients often resembles an edge effect, the magnitude of which is inversely proportional to the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of L. humile.  The direct effects of Argentine ant invasions in natural environments are therefore amplified by inputs of urban run-off & agricultural run-off.  Indirect ecological effects of these invasions arise from the loss of large-bodied ants, arid-adapted ants, & unique behavioral repertoires of particular native ant species.  These aspects of functional homogenization affect invaded communities require further study.  At least in arid regions, the close association between L. humile & soil moisture suggests, that control strategies might be aimed at reducing urban run-off in order to maintain functionally diverse communities of native ants.]",

    "abstract": "Hypotheses concerning community-level vulnerability to invasion often emphasize biotic interactions but fail to consider fine-scale variation in the physical environment. In this study, the interplay between interspecific competition and abiotic factors is examined with respect to whether scrub habitats in southern California become invaded by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Argentine ants penetrate further into and attain higher abundances in mesic scrub fragments than they do in xeric scrub fragments. Probably as a result, native ant richness is lower in small (<30 ha), mesic fragments than in either small, xeric fragments or in small plots in unfragmented areas. Compared to six species of native ants, Argentine ants ranked lowest in their ability to tolerate high temperatures in the laboratory with 100% of field-collected workers dying after 60 min of exposure to temperatures 46∞C. Field data corroborate these results; mean temperatures at which colonies of Argentine ants attained maximum abundance at baits (34.0∞C) and abandoned baits (41.6∞C) were both lower than for the native ant Dorymyrmex insanus. Laboratory studies further revealed that low levels of soil moisture depress mean worker survival in experimental colonies of Argentine ants. In a factorial laboratory experiment that varied both physical conditions and interspecific competition, Argentine ants exhibited greater worker activity and survival under warm, moist conditions than under hot, dry conditions, whereas the presence of a competitor, Forelius mccooki, had no significant effect. Experimental colonies of F. mccooki, in contrast, were more active under hot, dry conditions than under warm, moist conditions and exhibited reduced activity in the presence of L. humile irrespective of physical conditions. Taken together, these experimental data demonstrate how the abiotic environment impinges on both colony-level activity and colony growth in the Argentine ant and provide a general explanation for the patterns observed at the community level. A key consequence of the condition-specific nature of the competitive asymmetry between Argentine ants and native ants is that community-level vulnerability to invasion appears to depend primarily on the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of L. humile.",

There were differences between particle size of which the most mass was removed and of which there were more particles removed by ants. California Argentine ants, southern fire ants, and Alabama Argentine ants removed more 840 to 1,000-micrometer particle mass of the anchovy diet but had more visits to dishes containing 420 to 590 micrometer particles. California harvester ants and Allegheny mound ants, Formica spp., removed more >2,000 micrometer particle mass but visited dishes containing 1,000 to 2,000 micrometer particles more often. Red imported fire ants also removed more >2,000 micrometer particle mass but visited dishes with 590 to 840-micrometer particles most often. Pharaoh ants, Monomorium pharaonis (L.), removed and visited 420 to 590-micrometer particles more than any other size.

The majority of particles of commercial ant bait, including Amdro, Ascend, Award, Bushwhacker, Max Force with fipronil, and old and new formulations of Max Force with hydramethylnon, were 1,000 to 2,000 micrometer, but the majority of Niban particles were <420 micrometer.

    "abstract": "The functions and compositions of symbiotic bacterial communities often correlate with host ecology. Yet cause-effect relationships and the order of symbiont vs. host change remain unclear in the face of ancient symbioses and conserved host ecology. Several groups of ants exemplify this challenge, as their low\u0010nitrogen diets and specialized symbioses appear conserved and ancient. To address whether nitrogen\u0010provisioning symbionts might be important in the early stages of ant trophic shifts, we studied bacteria from the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile - an invasive species that has transitioned towards greater consumption of sugar\u0010rich, nitrogen\u0010poor foods in parts of its introduced range. Bacteria were present at low densities in most L. humile workers, and among those yielding quality 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data, we found just three symbionts to be common and dominant. Two, a Lactobacillus and an Acetobacteraceae species, were shared between native and introduced populations. The other, a Rickettsia, was found only in two introduced supercolonies. Across an eight\u0010year period of trophic reduction in one introduced population, we found no change in symbionts, arguing against a relationship between natural dietary change and microbiome composition. Overall, our findings thus argue against major changes in symbiotic bacteria in association with the invasion and trophic shift of L. humile. In addition, genome content from close relatives of the identified symbionts suggests that just one can synthesize most essential amino acids; this bacterium was only modestly abundant in introduced populations, providing little support for a major role of nitrogen\u0010provisioning symbioses in Argentine ant\u0019s dietary shift.",

    "abstract": "Background: Centromeres are essential for accurate chromosome segregation, yet sequence conservation is low even among closely related species. Centromere drive predicts rapid turnover because some centromeric sequences may compete better than others during female meiosis. In addition to sequence composition, longer centromeres may have a transmission advantage.  Results: We report the first observations of extremely long centromeres, covering on average 34 % of the chromosomes, in the red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta. By comparison, cytological examination of Solenopsis geminata revealed typical small centromeric constrictions. Bioinformatics and molecular analyses identified CenSol, the major centromeric satellite DNA repeat. We found that CenSol sequences are very similar between the two species but the CenSol copy number in S. invicta is much greater than that in S. geminata. In addition, centromere expansion in S. invicta is not correlated with the duplication of CenH3. Comparative analyses revealed that several closely related fire ant species also possess long centromeres.  Conclusions: Our results are consistent with a model of simple runaway centromere expansion due to centromere drive. We suggest expanded centromeres may be more prevalent in hymenopteran insects, which use haplodiploid sex determination, than previously considered.

    "abstract": "Collective behaviours are influenced by the behavioural composition of the group. For example, a collective behaviour may emerge from the average behaviour of the group\u0019s constituents, or be driven by a few key individuals that catalyse the behaviour of others in the group. When ant colonies collectively relocate to a new nest site, there is an inherent trade-off between the speed and accuracy of their decision of where to move due to the time it takes to gather information. Thus, variation among workers in exploratory behaviour, which allows gathering information about potential new nest sites, may impact the ability of a colony to move quickly into a suitable new nest. The invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, expands its range locally through the dispersal and establishment of propagules: groups of ants and queens. We examine whether the success of these groups in rapidly finding a suitable nest site is affected by their behavioural composition. We compared nest choice speed and accuracy among groups of all-exploratory, all-nonexploratory and half-exploratory-half-nonexploratory individuals. We show that exploratory individuals improve both the speed and accuracy of collective nest choice, and that exploratory individuals have additive, not synergistic, effects on nest site selection. By integrating an examination of behaviour into the study of invasive species we shed light on the mechanisms that impact the progression of invasion.",

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), has spread worldwide, often decimating native ant populations and other arthropod species in invaded areas. It is not known what abiotic and biotic conditions limit its distribution. We investigated the distribution of the Argentine ant in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in northern California, a nature preserve that has been partially invaded by these ants. Canonical correlation analysis showed that the Argentine ant is most likely to occur near the edges of the preserve, which are next to disturbed areas and in low-elevation areas. Native ant species are associated with higher-elevation areas farther from the preserve edge. Distance to surface water and insolation were less important in predicting Argentine ant distribution. This suggests that dispersal from disturbed areas strongly determines the spread of the invasion. We examined how the daily activity patterns of Argentine ants and several native and species depend on soil temperature, air temperature, and relative humidity. There was considerable overlap in activity times, and there were no values of any of the abiotic factors measured in which native ant species were more likely to be active than Argentine ants.   Because the Argentine ant is usually active at the same times as any native species, most native species in invaded areas are likely to encounter the invaders frequently. Diet overlap was high with most native ant species except for seed-eating species. Overlap in activity times may intensify both exploitative and interference competition between the Argentine and native ant species.",

    "abstract": "The ecology and dispersal dynamics of unicolonial ant invaders are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the genetic structure of a well\u0010documented, invading population of Argentine ants in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in northern California to examine the dispersal distances of reproductives, the direction and mode of population expansion, and changes in the genetic differentiation among nests over time. Using microsatellite data, we measure both traditional FST statistics and multi\u0010locus genotype assignment distances to determine the patterns of genetic structure at three spatial scales: population\u0010wide gene flow, population substructure, and mixing between neighboring nests. At the population level, there was little viscosity across the Jasper Ridge population, suggesting recent rapid expansion and/or considerable long\u0010distance gene flow, presumably mediated by winged males. The pattern of genetic structure across distance indicates that the scale of queen dispersal was limited to less than 100 m. At the level of population substructure, hierarchical F statistics measures were low across subpopulations, locations within subpopulations, and nests. However, multi\u0010locus genotype assignment tests revealed significant structure between subpopulations and between locations. Genetic distances between nests were lower within locations than between locations, indicating that nests are most closely related to neighboring nests and that the expansion of subpopulations is primarily due to the local budding of new nests from existing nests at the invasion front. At the level of nest connectivity, the genetic differentiation among neighboring nests was associated with the time since invasion. As the invasion proceeds, nearby nests tend to be less closely related, indicating that extensive local mixing does not occur among more established nests. Our results show that the genetic structure of nests was not homogenous across unicolonial populations. Instead, the patterns of genetic structure reflect the limitations of and barriers to the dispersal of Argentine ant reproductives, the demographic history of the Jasper Ridge invasion, and changes in the genetic and ecological environment during the course of the invasion.",

Each of the five mutually antagonistic supercolonies was fixed for one of the 5 haplotypes, & multiple supercolonies were found within a small area.  The large number of haplotypes found in Japan likely reflects the strong propagule pressure of L. humile resulting from the fact that the country is one of the top five importers of trade commodities world-wide.  The short invasion history of L. humile in Japan could explain the maintenance of genetic diversity of each independent introduction.  In addition, our sampling mostly occurred at major international shipping ports that are likely to be primary sites of introduction.  The several recently established L. humile populations within a small area in Japan provide an opportunity to identify the sources of introduction & the local patterns of spread.]",

The gall wasp Disholcaspis eldoradensis induces plant galls that secrete a sweet honeydew from their top surfaces while the wasp larvae are active. These galls are actively tended by Argentine ants, which collect the honeydew and drive off parasitoids attempting to attack the gall wasp. 3. When ants were excluded, the total rate of parasitism by seven species of parasitoids increased by 36%, and the rate of gall-wasp emergence decreased by 54%. 4. The total percentage parasitism was affected by gall density when ants were excluded but not when ants were unmanipulated, suggesting a change in parasitoid functional responses due to ant tending. 5. In addition, excluding ants significantly altered the proportions of different parasitoid species that emerged from galls; one parasitoid species increased from 1% to 34%, and another decreased from 46% to 19%. 6. The invasive Argentine ants studied are capable of maintaining the mutualism with the gall wasps that evolved in the presence of different ant species and also act as a selective filter for the local community of generalist parasitoids trying to attack this gall species.",

    "abstract": "The effect of an irrigated buckwheat cover crop on populations of beneficial insects and grape pests, vine growth, grape yield, and berry quality was investigated over 1year in a commercial organic vineyard in southern California, USA. Buckwheat was grown in the spring and summer with additional irrigation that supplemented prevailing vine watering regimens. Treatments replicated four, three and six times respectively were: (1) buckwheat cover crop with supplemental irrigation between vine rows; (2) supplemental irrigation with no buckwheat cover crop; and (3) control plots with no buckwheat cover crop or supplemental irrigation. Flowering buckwheat was extremely attractive to beneficial insects at the beginning of the trial, resulting in 27 times more insects captured from shake sampling, compared with grape foliage in control plots. Results from sticky trap and visual count data indicated that buckwheat may enhance the abundance of generalist predators at certain times. However, densities of pestiferous leafhoppers on grape leaves in August was significantly higher (129\u0013240% greater) in irrigated buckwheat and irrigated plots lacking buckwheat when compared with control plots. This increase in leafhopper density may be attributed to these pests preferring well-irrigated, vigorously growing vines. Mean cane weight was 222% and 170% greater for vines in irrigated buckwheat and irrigated plots lacking buckwheat, respectively, compared with controls indicating that vine vigor increased with supplemental irrigation. An irrigated buckwheat cover crop increased berry size, on average, by 0.67mm for berries harvested on the side of the row that contained buckwheat, and reduced sugar content of berries by 3.2∞ Brix, compared with non-irrigated controls. Additionally, the buckwheat cover crop was associated with reduced berry quality because of insect feeding damage. Under drought conditions and water shortages, supplemental irrigation to support cover crops may result in water use penalties. Irrigated cover cropping during summer months may not be a viable pest management option for grape growers in southern California.          *[No specific ants mentioned.  Ants listed as a pest.  Ants were not collected on sticky traps & ants averaged 5.91 ants per shake sample.  There was no treatment effect on ant counts for samples collected 19 June 2008 or 30 July 2008.

    "abstract": "*[We used a comparative & manipulative approach to test 3 related hypotheses about the determinants of heat tolerance or critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in urban ants: specifically, that (a) body size, (b) hydration status, & (c) chosen microenvironments influence CTmax.  We tested a 4th hypothesis that native species are particularly physiologically vulnerable in urban environments.  We manipulated water access & determined CTmax for 11 species common to cities in California's Central Valley that exhibit nearly 300\u0010fold variation in body size.  There was a moderate phylogenetic signal influencing CTmax, & inter (but not intra) specific variation in body size influenced CTmax, where larger species had higher CTmax.  The sensitivity of ants' CTmax to water availability exhibited species\u0010specific thresholds, where short\u0010term water limitation (8 hr) reduced CTmax & body water content in some species, while longer\u0010term water limitation (32 hr) was required to reduce these traits in other species.  However, CTmax was not related to the temperatures chosen by ants during activity.  Further, we found support for our 4th hypothesis because CTmax & estimates of thermal safety margin in native species were more sensitive to water availability relative to non\u0010native species.]",

This paper describes all 3 castes of P. hoelldobleri as well as the alate queen of P. mohavensis, which is very similar to that of P. hoelldobleri.  A molecular phylogeny that consisted of 3,703 bp from one mitochondrial & 5 nuclear gene fragments supported the monophyly of P. hoelldobleri, P. magnacanthus, & P. mohavensis.  Pogonomyrmex magnacanthus can be separated from other P. californicus group species based on: 1) its unusually large eyes, 2) a high ocular index, & 3) a malar ratio that is typically more-than 1.0.

Documented 170 native ant species in 33 genera, plus 6 non-native species, in Baja California. The Chao-2 estimator of species richness, at 206.0 species, is about 20% higher than the observed species richness.  About 30% of the species and 20% of the genera are restricted within Baja California to the relatively mesic California Floristic Province of northwestern Baja California.  Nearly all of these species also occur in California.  Forty-seven species (27.6%) are peninsula endemics.  Using our entire data set, the peninsular effect appears to be strong, with about twice as many species in the northern state of Baja California than are recorded from the southern state of Baja California Sur; the ratio of genera is 33 to 24.  However, this effect becomes weak at the species level & absent at the genus level when minimizing habitat effects by omitting species restricted to the California Floristic Province.  At a finer scale, across latitudinal blocks of about 1.9-degrees, the number of species declines towards central portions of the peninsula & then increases in the Cape Region.  Nine ant species display strongly disjunct distributions, & these occur in 2 general patterns, peninsula disjuncts& peninsula-mainland disjuncts.  Habitat diversity, especially that related to topographic relief, appears to be the most important factor affecting the gradient of ant species richness in Baja California.]",

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), and the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, are natural agonists in their country of origin. Since the first report of L. humile in California in 1907 its range expanded statewide, displacing native ant species wherever it spread. Since the discovery of established populations of S. invicta in southern California in 1998, it has been restricted to discrete areas of southern California. However, as these discrete populations expand, they are encountering large populations of L. humile, which are effective competitors for available resources and are particularly aggressive in their encounters with other ant species such as S. invicta. Most Dolichoderine ants such as L. humile do not prefer to forage on baits made with defatted corn grit and soybean oil typically used in red imported fire ant control programs. Applications of these baits in areas where distributions of these species overlap might selectively affect populations of S. invicta and give L. humile a competitive advantage.  Three laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the competitive outcomes between S. invicta pitted against L. humile: 1) agonistic behavior of workers in small arenas, 2) colony interactions with different population ratios, and 3) the effects of pyriproxyfen on the competitiveness of S. invicta against L. humile.  Populations of S. invicta consisting of major workers killed more L. humile than did minors or a mixture of majors and minors. When paired against L. humile colonies consisting of 1,100 workers, colonies consisting of 38 S. invicta workers were easily defeated by L. humile. Colonies consisting of 450 S. invicta workers plugged their nest entrances, but they were ultimately defeated by L. humile after 13 d. The S. invicta colonies consisting of 1,100 workers took control of the bridge connecting the colonies, invaded the L. humile colony, killed the Argentine ant queens, and removed their brood. Pyriproxyfen-treated fire ant workers took significantly longer to chase the Argentine ants from a connecting bridge than did untreated fire ants. Thus, fire ant baits may have long-term effects on intercolonial aggression between S. invicta and L. humile, especially when Argentine ant populations are high in the summer.",

    "abstract": "The parasitoid complex of brown soft scale, Coccus hesperidum L., a multivoltine soft scale, was determined in southern California citrus over the period February 2004-March 2006. The survey was conducted by placing brown soft scale-infested yucca leaves in the canopy of citrus trees and subsequently rearing individually isolated parasitized scales in the laboratory. A total of 14 species parasitized brown soft scale in the field, the most abundant ones belonging to the genus Metaphycus Mercet (75%). The most abundant parasitoid species was Metaphycus angustifrons Compere (38% parasitism), and this is a new record of establishment for this species in California. Coccophagus species accounted for only 11% parasitism. There were important spatio-temporal differences across the parasitoid complex survey locations. We also found that the five most abundant encyrtid parasitoid species showed preferences for scales of different sizes. Our results have implications for biological control of citricola scale, Coccus pseudomagnoliarum (Kuwana), an important pest of citrus in the San Joaquin Valley of central California. Notably, this species is nearly absent in southern California. Brown soft scale is considered to be an alternate host for parasitoids of citricola scale, a univoltine soft scale, at times when the latter species is unavailable for parasitism.          *[In most cases, brownsoft scale is economic only when dense aggregations form as a result of it being tended by ants.  This relationship between ants & brown soft scale is mutualistic, in that the ants obtain honeydew from the scale while in return, they protect the scale from its natural enemies (predators and parasitoids).  In the absence of ants, brown soft scale is normally under natural control & only achieves pest status when its natural enemies are disrupted.  We excluded ants because citricola scale is not tended by ants, especially the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile(Mayr) contrary to brown soft scale, & thus our survey results would be more realistic.]",

We found that precipitation and standing water were positively correlated with locations and years of high abundance of caterpillars of the ranchman's tiger moth, Platyprepia virginalis. We analyzed 30 years of survey data and found that the number of large rainfall events was a better predictor of caterpillar abundance than total annual accumulation. We considered three ecological mechanisms that could drive this relationship and conducted observations and manipulative experiments to evaluate these mechanisms. (1) Rainfall facilitates more plant growth, although we found no evidence that increased food quality or quantity was causing the positive association between precipitation and caterpillar abundance. (2) Large rainfall events cause predatory ground\u0010nesting ants to be less abundant and we found that the number of ants that recruited to local sites was negatively associated with survival and abundance of caterpillars. (3) We found that litter from wet sites provided a refuge from ant predation; litter from wet sites was not beneficial to caterpillars in the absence of ants. Both abiotic factors (precipitation) and biotic factors (predatory ants) affected the temporal and spatial abundance of caterpillars directly and interactively. Climate models predict that rainfall will become more variable, suggesting that populations of this caterpillar may also become more variable in the future.",

    "abstract": "1. Climate and, therefore, abiotic conditions, are changing rapidly, and many ecological interactions depend on them. In this study, how abiotic conditions mediate a predator-prey interaction were examined.  2. Caterpillars of Platyprepia virginalis (Boisduval) (Arctiidae) were found previously to be more abundant in wet habitats and thick litter cover compared with drier habitats and little or no litter. We hypothesised that wet litter provided caterpillars with refuges from an important ant predator, Formica lasioides. It was further hypothesised that caterpillars would be able to move at lower temperatures than ants, thus providing them with a thermal refuge.  3. In the lab, caterpillars were more likely to escape ant predation and survive on wet litter and at lower temperatures. At all temperatures, ant recruitment was lower in wet litter than dry litter although ants were more active on litter than bare soil. Thus, wet litter may serve as a habitat refuge for caterpillars from ants.  4. Caterpillars were able to maintain activity at temperatures 8-14\t∞C lower than F. lasioides. Thus colder temperatures may serve as a thermal refuge for caterpillars from ants.  5. It was hypothesised that caterpillars can escape ant predation when precipitation causes wet litter and at temperatures that they experience commonly in the field. This mismatch between caterpillars and their predators in ability to tolerate wet litter and low temperatures may affect their field distribution and abundance. Expected future warmer and drier conditions may not provide these refuges.",

    "abstract": "The tritrophic model featuring plants consumed by herbivores consumed by parasitoids or predators has become the primary paradigm used to describe herbivore dynamics. However, interactions involving herbivores can be habitat- specific and plants often provide habitat, as well as food. Structural complexity of the habitat may favor predators or may allow herbivore prey to escape detection and capture. This study considered the spatial and temporal dynamics of an arctiid caterpillar, Platyprepia virginalis. The tritrophic model that includes only a tachinid parasitoid that attacks P. virginalis and the caterpillars' primary host-plant, Lupinus arboreus, has failed to provide much insight into this system. Instead, we found that ants killed and removed many small caterpillars. Protecting caterpillars from ants increased their survival three-fold and five-fold in assays conducted during two years. Caterpillars were more likely to survive in short-term assays at sites that naturally had a deeper cover of dead and living plant material. Experiments with baits showed that ant recruitment declined as litter depth increased on average. These survey results indicated that ant predation was an important source of mortality for young caterpillars and that the presence of thick litter reduced this mortality. These results were corroborated in an experiment that manipulated litter depth and ant access to caterpillars. Previous findings that other defoliating caterpillars increased litter depth and benefitted P. virginalis are also consistent with this hypothesis. Litter acts as an important non-trophic resource, allowing caterpillars to avoid predation by ants such that wet sites with deep litter act as source populations for caterpillars. Our results show strong effects of both trophic and non-trophic interactions since plants indirectly provided limiting habitat and this heterogeneous habitat strongly affected risk of predation and ultimately caterpillar abundance and distribution.",

Ant colony abundance changed from \u001249% to +61%. Consistent with Thermal Performance Theory, colony abundance increased with temperature increases < 1∞C, then decreased as a site's mean monthly temperature change increased up to +2.4∞C. Consistent with Species Energy Theory, (1) ant abundance tracked changes in a measure of energy availability (net aboveground productivity, g C∑m{≤∑yr{π) and (2) increases in colony abundance drove increases in local plot\u0010 and transect\u0010level species richness but not that of Chao 2, an estimate of the size of the species pool. Even after accounting for these drivers, local species richness was still higher ~20 yr after the original surveys, likely due to the increased activity of ant workers. These results suggest community changes are predictable using theory from geographical ecology, and that warming can first enhance but may ultimately decrease the abundance of this important insect taxon.",

    "abstract": "Ecological communities and their component populations vary geographically in abundance. Energy theory posits that abundance (the number of individuals area-1) should increase with the ratio of available energy (as net primary productivity, NPP) to individual energy use (i.e. metabolic rate). Most tests of energy theory evaluate the assumption that population abundance decreases as body mass-0.75 (a proxy of metabolic rate). Using 664 ant populations from 49 communities we examine how both NPP and body mass - individually and as a ratio - predict abundance (colonies m-2) at these different levels of taxonomic aggregation. Energy theory best predicts ant abundance when populations are aggregated into communities. At the population level, abundance formed a unimodal scatter plot vs all three drivers - colony mass, NPP, and NPP mass-0.75 - suggesting that the majority of populations exist below energetic limits set by the ecosystem. At the community level, however, abundance scaled as predicted for mass-0.75 and NPP1.0, (b = -0.75 and 1.0, respectively) and was a positive decelerating function of their ratio (i.e. [NPP mass-0.75]0.61, r2= 0.68). Since geographic trends in colony mass and abundance are largely reciprocal - deserts tend to support few large colonies, and tropical rainforests support many small colonies - the geography of ant biomass (g m-2) is remarkably invariant.",

    "abstract": "Residents in the southeastern United States would hardly describe life with the aggressive imported fire ant as peaceful coexistence. The continued spread of these insects has produced agricultural problems, changes in the ecosystem, and increasing numbers of subjects with sting sequelae, including hypersensitivity reactions, secondary infections, and rare neurologic sequelae. Evolutionary changes have facilitated their expansion northward into Virginia and westward into California, and increasing urbanization will likely permit further expansion. Recent reports of building invasion with sting attacks inside occupied dwellings, including health care facilities, heighten public health concerns. This article reviews the medically important entomology, clinical aspects of stings, and the current approaches to chemical control of fire ants. We also propose directions for future research and treatment.  (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)",

Sampling of the ant community was done using pitfall traps placed along transects that crossed 3 vegetation types found at the study site: (1) riparian woodland dominated by coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), & willow (Salix spp.), (2) Hard chaparral dominated by scrub oak (Q. dumosa) & silk-tassel bush (Garrya sp.), & (3) Coastal scrub dominated by black sage (Salvia mellifera), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), & Yucca (Yucca whipplei).  Linepithema humile has become well established throughout the lower reaches of the study site except in the chaparral vegetation.  Ten species of native ants were found in the study area, but there was little to no correlation or cooccurrence between L. humile & native ant species.  Total species diversity in areas where L. humile occurred was significantly less, than in areas where L. humile was absent.]",

    "abstract": "Hummingbirds utilize visual cues to locate flowers, but little is known about the role olfaction plays in nectar foraging despite observations that hummingbirds avoid resources occupied by certain insects. We investigated the behavioral responses of both wild and captive hummingbirds to olfactory cues of hymenopteran floral visitors, including native wood ants (Formica francoeuri), invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), and European honeybees (Apis mellifera). We demonstrate for the first time that hummingbirds use olfaction to make foraging decisions when presented with insect-derived chemical cues under field and aviary conditions. Both wild and captive hummingbirds avoided foraging on feeders with defensive chemicals of F. francoeuri and aggregation pheromones of L. humile, but showed no response to honeybee cuticular hydrocarbons. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of olfaction in shaping hummingbird foraging decisions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Recent reviews reveal that avian olfaction is not just limited to vultures and a few taxa. We demonstrate that a very charismatic group, hummingbirds, avoid defensive and aggregatory chemical cues from insects present at nectar resources. Olfactory cues can provide critical information about the presence and potential threat of insect floral visitors. This study raises new questions about the underrated importance of olfaction in avian foraging and specifically, hummingbird foraging.",

    "abstract": "This is the first compilation of our research and data from the literature on the duration and thermal reaction norms for development in ants. Altogether, 97 regression lines characterizing the linear dependence of ant brood (egg, larval, prepupal and pupal) development on temperature were obtained for 33 species from 15 genera and three subfamilies. Significant positive correlations between the durations of different immature stages were revealed. We found differences between thermal reaction norms for development for various immature stages, some taxonomic groups, and southern and northern groups of species. All immature stages appeared to be shorter on average at 25 degrees-C in northern ants compared to southern species; this difference is insignificant only for eggs. Highly significant negative correlations were revealed between the temperature threshold for development (TTD) and the sum of degree-days (SDD) for all immature stages. The latitudinal trends in intraspecific variation of thermal constants appeared to be opposite to those we observed at the interspecific level. At the latter, the coefficient of thermal sensitivity of development (i.e. the coefficient of linear regression of development rate on temperature) and TTD tends to decrease and SDD to increase from the south to the north. In contrast, at the intraspecific level, development became more temperature-sensitive in northern populations, i.e. characterized by higher slopes of regression lines of development rate on temperature, and higher TTDs. The species of the genus Formica are characterized by the shortest and the most temperature-sensitive immature development among all the ant species studied.",

    "abstract": "The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, is a significant economic pest of citrus because it vectors a bacterium that causes the lethal citrus disease huanglongbing. From 2015-2016, digital video recorders were used to identify natural enemy species attacking sentinel immature D. citri colonies deployed monthly at three urban sites in southern California. Natural enemy activity during both daylight and nighttime hours was recorded. To examine the impact of ant-hemipteran mutualisms on biological control efficacy, we compared natural enemy interactions with D. citri colonies that were either fully exposed or protected from walking arthropods with a sticky barrier. Spiders (Aranae), syrphid larvae (Syrphidae), predatory mites (Phytoseiidae), green lacewing larvae (Chrysopidae), thrips (Thripidae), and the introduced parasitoid, Tamarixia radiata, were the dominant natural enemy groups visiting immature D. citri colonies over the course of the study. A significant proportion of syrphid and green lacewing larvae, and T. radiata visits to the sentinel colonies resulted in D. citri attacks. Spiders rarely attacked immature D. citri. Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, were the most common arthropod visiting D. citri colonies across all study sites and ants were active day and night. When ant access to D. citri colonies was restricted, natural enemy abundance and attack rates increased, particularly those by syrphids and T. radiata. This study highlights the importance of natural enemies and ant-psyllid interactions in the biological control of D. citri in urban citrus ecosystems. Therefore, conservation of natural enemies and ant control should be considered for the sustainable management of this pest-disease complex.",

    "abstract": "Bamboo with its hollow internodes is utilized as habitat by many generalist arboreal ants. Interestingly, a few species of ants have become obligate bamboo specialists, among them an as yet undescribed Tetraponera sp. near attenuata F. Smith (T. sp. PSW-80 in the collection of P. S. Ward, University of California at Davis). This ant inhabits the stem internodes of at least 3 spp. of large bamboo, including Gigantochloa scortechinii Gamble (up to 25m tall, 10 cm diameter), the most common host plant at our main investigation site, the Ulu Gombak Field Studies Center near Kuala Lumpur. The large monogynous colonies may occupy dozens of internodes in different culms. Only internodes with small access holes are inhabited that can be blocked by one to a few workers to ward off potential intruders. During heavy rainstorms, runoff-water may flow into the internodes through the entrance holes. T. sp. responds with an effective countermeasure: The workers ingest the liquid and regurgitate it to the outside until no standing water remains. T. sp. apparently derives much of its food requirements from the honeydew of its symbiontic pseudococcids, Kermicus wroughtoni Newstead, which are kept inside the internodes. The close symbiosis of T. sp. with Kermicus becomes particularly apparent during the mating flight: The young queens carry Kermicus crawlers along in their mandibles for colony foundation. Unlike many other Pseudomyrmecinae, T. sp. does not exhibit predatory behavior but instead scavenges decaying plant matter, feces, and dead arthropods. There are also extended periods with no outside foraging. In contrast to other pseudomyrmecine plant specialists that reach comparable colony sizes, T. sp. is unaggressive and does not defend its host. Several species of spiders and the specialized staphylinid beetle Orphnebius politus are important predators of T. sp.",

When extracts of the mandibular glands of this ant and dendrolasin (a chemical known to occur in the mandibular glands of another ant) were topically applied to the aphids the proportions of apterae also increased. The results suggest that the apterizing effect associated with ant-attendance may in part be mediated by a transfer of a juvenile hormone-related chemical from the ants to the aphids.",

    "abstract": "Many tropical insect species remain formally undescribed, and the validity of some rarely collected and poorly studied taxa is uncertain. Overbeckia Viehmeyer, 1916 is a monotypic ant genus and a rare member of the arboreal ant communities of tropical South East Asia and Australasia. Overbeckia subclavata Viehmeyer, 1916 was collected and described from Singapore more than a century ago and there have been few other records of these ants since. Here we compare the existing Overbeckia records with recent collections in Australia, New Guinea and Indonesia. We revise the taxonomic diagnosis of the genus Overbeckia in comparison with other genera of the diverse tribe Camponotini, redescribe O. subclavata and describe two new species, Overbeckia papuana sp. nov., and Overbeckia jambiensis, sp. nov. We also summarise all available ecological and distributional information of the genus, indicating that Overbeckia occurs in a variety of lowland vegetation types, from rainforests to secondary growth and plantations but is extremely rare. Using external morphological characters, internal proventricular structures and a molecular phylogeny of 78 Camponotini species based on five protein-coding loci, we demonstrate that Overbeckia is a monophyletic lineage. Molecular-clock calibrated trees using 21 fossil records indicate that the divergence between Overbeckia and its sister clade comprising the genera Echinopla Smith, 1857 and Calomyrmex Emery, 1895 occurred c. 21Ma (95% highest posterior density 14-28), and that the divergence between the three Overbeckia species likely occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene. In addition, we transfer one Camponotus Mayr, 1861 species to Colobopsis in the light of molecular evidence: Colobopsis triangulata (Klimes & McArthur, 2014) comb. nov. Our analysis represents the most comprehensive phylogeny of the tribe Camponotini in terms of coverage of extant divergent lineages, including Overbeckia , and suggests relatively robust phylogenetic relationships among genera that are consistent with published phylogenomic trees. Overall, our study reveals cryptic species diversity in Overbeckia and provides strong evidence that this is a valid and polytypic ant genus.",

Technical Abstract: Keeping pace with the dynamic and evolving landscape of invasive ants in California presents a formidable challenge to the pest management industry. Pest management professionals (PMPs) are on the frontlines when it comes to battling these exotic ant pests, and are often the first ones to intercept these accidental introductions. Developing effective control strategies for various pest ants is an important goal; however, the use of insecticides should not be the only means. Given the general public's increasing environmental awareness, new and emerging regulatory issues with pesticide runoff into urban waterways, and the structural pest control industry\"s adoption of \"greener\" Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, there is a growing demand for less-toxic, more target-specific, and environmentally-friendly pest control techniques. Successful IPM of urban pest ants requires close collaboration with the pest management professional (PMP) and homeowner to implement non-chemical control strategies. This book provides in-depth descriptions of IPM strategies for ants in general which include 1) habitat modification; 2) physical/mechanical barriers to exclude ants; 3) biological methods such as natural enemies and biocontrol agents; and, 4) chemical methods including repellents, contact insecticides, and baits. More specific guidelines for over 15 major or emerging pest ant species in California are discussed. Because control strategies are often tailored to the unique biology of each pest ant species, identifying characteristics and biology of these ants are provided. The book is to serve as a useful reference to both PMPs and homeowners in order to foster their collaborative effort in finding more environmentally friendly solutions to urban ant problems.

    "abstract": "The Red Imported Fire Ant (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta (Buren), is an insect pest of particular importance in California due to its potential impact on public health, agriculture, and wildlife. In 1997, RIFAs hitchhiked to the Central Valley on honeybee hives brought in from Texas for pollination of an almond orchard (Dowell et al. 1997). There has been local spread from these locations to surrounding irrigated areas. In 1998 the ants were detected in several other locations including an area covering at least 50 square miles of Orange County.As a consequence, all of Orange County, parts of Riverside County between Palms Springs and Indio, and one square mile of the Moreno Valley, were quarantined. RIFA has both beneficial and detrimental effects on our environment. Their large mounded nests, which can be 35 cm (1.1 feet) high, damage mowing and harvesting equipment. When people or animals disturb their nest, the highly aggressive ants swarm out, attack and sting the unwary intruder. In some cases people hypersensitive to their venom have died. The spread of RIFA throughout California will result in the establishment of a major nuisance pest. Annual losses are estimated to be between $389 million at the low level and $994 million at the high. Regulatory agencies and academic institutions should collaborate closely to address the imported fire ant problem in a coordinated effort through research, education and regulatory programs before fire ants become permanently entrenched in California. This chapter discusses all of the aspects related to the invasion of the imported fire ant in California.

    "abstract": "One of the main aspects associated with the diversity in animal colour is the variation in melanization levels. In ectotherms, melanism can be advantageous in aiding thermoregulation through heat absorption. Darker bodies may also serve as a shield from harmful UV-B radiation. Melanism may also confer protection against parasites and predators through improving immunity responses and camouflage in regions with high precipitation, with complex and shaded vegetations and greater diversity of pathogens and parasites. We studied melanism evolution in the globally distributed ant genus Pheidole under the pressures of temperature, UV-B radiation and precipitation, while considering the effects of body size and nest habit, traits that are commonly overlooked. More importantly, we account for worker caste polymorphism, which is marked by distinct roles and behaviours. We revealed for the first time distinct evolutionary trajectories for each worker subcaste. As expected, major workers from species inhabiting locations with lower temperatures and higher precipitation tend to be more melanised. Curiously, we show a slight trend where minor workers of larger species also tend to have darker bodies when inhabiting regions with higher precipitation. Lastly, we did not find evidence for the effects of UV-B radiation and nest habit in the lightness variation of workers. Our paper explores the evolution of ant melanization considering a marked ant worker polymorphism and a wide range of ecological factors. We discuss our findings under the light of the Thermal Melanism Hypothesis, the Photoprotection Hypothesis and the Gloger\u0019s Rule.",

    "abstract": "*[Restoring large, complex landscapes can be challenging, especially given that some threats to native diversity and ecological function cannot be wholly eliminated. Santa Catalina Island, California, provides a valuable case study because its challenges include a variety of ecosystem threats, legal restrictions, and cultural attachments, as well as a vocal resident human population that often does not agree with conservation actions. Catalina Island has been highly modified by numerous invasive species, fragmentation and erosion from roads, altered hydrology from dams, and increased fire frequency. In this paper, I build on a previously published review of resources and threats and discuss potential management actions for those threats. Although the island\u0019s large size, rugged topography, and pervasive human influence limit management options, several feasible actions could have an important restorative effect. In particular, 'bottom-up' invader management may be a relatively noncontroversial way to produce multiple positive outcomes. Reducing fragmentation, restoring natural hydrologic regimes, and augmenting native plant cover could disadvantage invasive plant and animal species while promoting the native flora and fauna.]",

Carpenter ants did not infest kitchens & bathrooms as frequently as did the other common species.  Argentine ants were more difficult to control than any other species along the California coast & in densely populated areas based on the percentage of retreatments or call-backs for each species.  Argentine & pharaoh ants are extending their range within California with the Argentine ant being reported as far north as Humboldt County.

    "abstract": "We predict the future range of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta Buren within the United States based on climate and its current extreme distributions. To reach that goal, a dynamic model of colony growth with two time steps per day was formulated that operates by colony area, S, and alate production, a. Colony growth rate depended on daily maximum and minimum soil temperatures.  Temperature records at 4,537 meteorological stations within the current (near 1.5 million km2) and potential range of S. invicta were obtained from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center. At each station, a colony was allowed to grow and lifetime female alate production was calculated. Estimated alate production was then examined at current extremes of the fire ant distribution at selected locations in Arkansas, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Estimates from these locations were used to define four zones of colony proliferation success: certain, possible, undemonstrated, and improbable. An annual precipitation limit (510 mm) was selected to indicate regions where arid conditions may prohibit growth in areas without supplemental water sources. Results of the model predict that S. invicta will likely move 80-150 km north in Oklahoma and Arkansas. It will also likely continue expanding into portions of Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware in the east and New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon, Nevada, and maybe even Washington and Utah in the west.",

We sequenced Gp-9 and found that it encodes a pheromone-binding protein, a crucial molecular component in chemical recognition of conspecifics. This suggests that differences in worker Gp-9 genotypes between social forms may cause differences in workers' abilities to recognize queens and regulate their numbers. Analyses of sequence evolution indicate that regulation of social organization by Gp-9 is conserved in South American fire ant species exhibiting social polymorphism and suggest that positive selection has driven the divergence between the alleles associated with alternate social organizations.

We generated new Gp-9 sequences from 15 Solenopsis species and combined these with previously published sequences to conduct a comprehensive, phylogenetically based study of the molecular evolution of this important gene.  Our results confirm a link between the presence of b-like alleles and the expression of polygyny in all South American fire ant species known to possess colonies of both social forms.

    "abstract": "Ants commonly engage in facultative mutualisms with honeydew-excreting homopterans such as mealybugs and other scale insects. Attendant ants obtain a high-energy carbohydrate of predictable availability, while the homopteran trophobiont gains protection from natural enemies and potential benefits of sanitation (honeydew removal), maintenance of host-plant quality, and transport. In a California, USA, arboretum, we observed large numbers of dead and dying Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) that had become entrapped on viscid flower buds and flowers of South African species of Erica as they attempted to tend a South African mealybug (Delottococcus confusus). Mealybugs on viscid ericas were found on clusters of small buds before they had become sticky (and later in other areas that minimized exposure to stickiness). As buds developed, they became viscid, enclosing mealybugs within sticky flower parts and precluding further attendance by ants. Ants, however, were able to tend mealybugs without disruption on nonsticky ericas. Counts (n = 118) of haphazardly chosen stems of sticky ericas showed that significantly more dead ants were present on mealybug-infested stems. We suggest that evolutionary histories help explain the disparate outcomes for ants and mealybugs on sticky ericas. The Argentine ant lacks an evolutionary history with sticky ericas, whereas the native South African mealybug presumably shares an evolutionary relationship with species of Erica in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We propose that the mealybug's behavior and waxy coating are adaptations for circumventing plant stickiness. Our observations might represent the first documentation of plant stickiness disrupting an ant-homopteran association.",

Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed a significant difference in the abundance and diversity of arthropods collected at treatment and control sites at 1 and 12 h postspray. Arthropods, primarily insects, from the treatment area included representatives from 12 orders and ee34 families, as compared to 7 orders and 12 families in the control area. Chironomidae (midges) and Formicidae (ants) were the most commonly represented families, accounting for 61%% of the arthropods collected from the treatment area; no large-bodied insects (>8 mm) were recovered. Mortality of sentinel mosquitoes in the treatment and control areas averaged 96%% and <1%%, respectively, at 24 h postexposure.

    "abstract": "*[The Imported Fire Ant (IFA) has become a major economic pest to vital sectors of the United States economy.  In order to estimate the economic impact of this pest on infested states within the United States & Puerto Rico, & potential damage fire ants would cause to Hawaii (if the island became infested), a study was conducted to estimate the annual economic impact of fire ants.  This report is based upon the 2000 Texas Economic Impact Study.  However, several adjustments were made to represent other states & their differences in numbers of sector entities, climatic conditions, fire ant infestation intensity, etc.  Economic impact can be defined as a positive or negative (benefit or cost) change in the economy due to an activity or industry.  It was found that the annual economic impact would be $5,651,859,165 in the United States & Puerto Rico using data collected in 1999.  If this estimate is updated to 2006 based upon the U.S. Labor of Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) & Producer Price Index (PPI), the estimate would be $6,323,404,458.  The detailed estimates by states & sectors are given in the Appendix.  These results can be used to assess damages & estimate the potential costs & benefits of any implemented control & management programs.  The two states with the greatest economic impact were Florida & Texas with annual damages of $1.3 billion ($1.6 billion) & $1.2 billion ($1.4 billion)  respectively.  The types of damages which were the greatest were residential households with over $3.5 billion (almost $5 billion),  electric & communication around $600 million (almost $800 million), & agriculture just under $500 million (over $500 million).

Monogyne queens are reported to possess only the GP-9B alleles, whereas polygyne queens possess both GP-9B & GP-9b.  Thus, both social forms are reported to express GP-9B, with GP-9b being a marker expressed in polygynes, but it is absent in monogynes.  Here, we report 2 types of polygyne colonies, one that does not express GP-9b (monogyne-like) & the other expressing both proteins, GP-9B & GP-9b.  Given their expression pattern, GP-9s are hemolymph proteins, which are more likely to be involved in the transport of lipids & small ligands within the homocoel.

A decline in the average density of navel orangeworm to less than 0.5% in late summer as measured by percentage of attacked almonds was observed in five orchards where insecticides were not applied during the growing season. K-value analyses indicated a significant regulation of the navel orangeworm population by Goniozus legneri Gordh during the first generation on almonds after hull split. A slight increase in navel orangeworm abundance was observed in one orchard in 1986, after insecticide applications. Significant (but low) correlations existed between higher yields of edible almonds and lower navel orangeworm densities. No significant correlations were found between total rejected almonds and numbers of the peach twig borer, Anarsia lineatella Zeller, or ant damage. An integrated pest management program may be possible for soft-shelled almonds by retaining sufficient holdover almonds during winter for host-parasitoid reproduction during the spring, and by targeting other arthropod pests (e.g., peach twig borer and phytophagous mites) with controls that are nondisruptive to navel orangeworm parasitoids.",

In this study, we compared the generic composition of intact and invaded ant communities from 12 published studies and found that invasive ant species alter the phylogenetic structure of native ant communities. Intact ant communities were phylogenetically evenly dispersed, suggesting that competition structures communities. However, in the presence of an invasive ant species, these same communities were phylogenetically clustered. Phylogenetic clustering in invaded communities suggests that invasive species may act as strong environmental filters and prune the phylogenetic tree of native species in a nonrandom manner, such that only a few closely related taxa can persist in the face of a biological invasion. Taxa that were displaced by invasive ant species were evenly dispersed in the phylogeny, suggesting that diversity losses from invasive ant species are not clustered in particular lineages. Collectively, these results suggest that there is strong phylogenetic structuring in intact native ant communities, but the spread of invasive species disassembles those communities above and beyond the effect of simple reductions in diversity.",

To favor one path over another requires ants to perceive, communicate and act upon important differences in length and risk between paths. Here, we present replicate Linepithema humile colonies with four equal-length paths to a sugar source. The paths vary in probabilities of encountering a risk cue that range from 0 to 100%. The risk cues were either live workers of an aggressive competitor (Liometopum occidentale: LO) or only formic acid (FA), a defensive chemical common in many formicine species. Both the probabilities of encounter and type of cue affected path preferences. Although across both cues the zero-risk path was most used, the use was not exclusive and patterns of response to the cues differed significantly. More ants were on all the paths when the cue was LO rather than FA, leading to a higher success rate at finding food. Worker numbers on paths with LO did decline over time as consistent with recognizing neighbors to be \u0018dear enemies\u0019 that are a reduced threat to the colony. Similarly, changes in path usage suggested that the FA cue also became viewed as less threatening over time when competitors were never simultaneously present. The results are consistent with L. humile exhibiting the behavioral plasticity and communicative ability needed to categorize and predict risk to efficiently collect food while defending against other ant species.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are a threat to global biodiversity and provide unique opportunities to study ecological processes. Population bottlenecks are a common feature of biological invasions and the severity of these bottlenecks is likely to be compounded as an invasive species spreads from initial invasion sites to additional locations. Despite extensive work on the genetic consequences of bottlenecks, we know little about how they influence microbial communities of the invaders themselves. Due to serial bottlenecks, invasive species may lose microbial symbionts including pathogenic taxa (the enemy release hypothesis) and/or may accumulate natural enemies with increasing time after invasion (the pathogen accumulation and invasive decline hypothesis). We tested these alternate hypotheses by surveying bacterial communities of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). We found evidence for serial symbiont bottlenecks: the bacterial community richness declined over the invasion pathway from Argentina to New Zealand. The abundance of some genera, such as Lactobacillus, also significantly declined over the invasion pathway. Argentine ants from populations in the United States shared the most genera with ants from their native range in Argentina, while New Zealand shared the least (120 vs. 57, respectively). Nine genera were present in all sites around the globe possibly indicating a core group of obligate microbes. In accordance with the pathogen accumulation and invasive decline hypothesis, Argentine ants acquired genera unique to each specific invaded country. The United States had the most unique genera, though even within New Zealand these ants acquired symbionts. In addition to our biogeographic sampling, we administered antibiotics to Argentine ants to determine if changes in the micro-symbiont community could influence behavior and survival in interspecific interactions. Treatment with the antibiotics spectinomycin and kanamycin only slightly increased Argentine ant interspecific aggression, but this increase significantly decreased survival in interspecific interactions. The survival of the native ant species also decreased when the symbiotic microbial community within Argentine ants was modified by antibiotics. Our work offers support for both the enemy release hypothesis and that invasive species accumulate novel microbial taxa within their invaded range. These changes appear likely to influence invader behavior and survival.",

Introduced species commonly participate in mutualisms, but how this phenomenon affects patterns of interactions among native mutualists remains incompletely understood. Here we examine how networks of interactions among aphid\u0010tending ants, ant\u0010tended aphids, and aphid\u0010attacking parasitoid wasps differ between 12 spatially paired riparian study sites with and without the introduced Argentine ant Linepithema humile in southern California. To resolve challenges in species identification, we used DNA barcoding to identify aphids and screen for parasitoid wasps (developing inside their aphid hosts) from 170 aphid aggregations sampled on arroyo willow Salix lasiolepis. Compared to uninvaded sites, invaded sites supported significantly fewer species of aphid\u0010tending ants and ant\u0010tended aphids. At invaded sites, for example, we found only two species of ant\u0010tended aphids, which were exclusively tended by L. humile, whereas at uninvaded sites we found 20 unique ant-aphid interactions involving eight species of ant\u0010tended aphids and nine species of aphid\u0010tending ants. Ant-aphid linkage density was thus significantly lower at invaded sites compared to uninvaded sites. We detected aphid parasitoids in 14% (28/198) of all aphid aggregations. Although the level of parasitism did not differ between invaded and uninvaded sites, more species of wasps were detected within uninvaded sites compared to invaded sites. These results provide a striking example of how the assimilation of introduced species into multi\u0010species mutualisms can reduce interaction diversity with potential consequences for species persistence.",

    "abstract": "For plant species that depend on animal\u0010mediated pollination, reproduction hinges on adequate access to pollinators. Even in the presence of intact pollinator assemblages, negative interactions among floral visitors can compromise pollination services. Ants, for example, visit flowers and can discourage visitation by other insects, but usually do not perform pollination themselves. Effects on plant reproduction that result from this type of interaction may be compounded by factors that increase the likelihood or extent of floral visitation by ants. Interactions between ants and honeydew\u0010producing insects alter the activity and local abundance of ants on plants, but the degree to which these interactions increase floral visitation by ants and in turn disrupt pollination services remains incompletely understood. We manipulated the abundance of cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) over three years to test how the interaction between honeydew\u0010producing aphids and the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) affects floral visitation by ants, floral visitation by bees, and seed production. Increasing aphid abundance increased ant abundance on cotton plants, and floral visitation by ants was positively related to ant abundance on leaves. The duration of visits by honey bees, the most common floral visitor aside from ants, declined with both increasing aphid abundance and increasing ant floral visitation. Two measures of seed production declined with increasing aphid abundance and reductions in the duration of bee visits. Aphid herbivory alone, however, did not affect seed production, which was independent of aphid abundance on plants that were manually cross\u0010pollinated under greenhouse conditions. Our results illustrate that interactions between ants and honeydew\u0010producing insects can enhance levels of floral visitation by ants and in turn disrupt pollination services enough to have measurable effects on plant reproduction.",

We compared the effects of floral visitation by the Argentine ant with those of the most prevalent native ant species (Crematogaster californica).  Compared to C. californica, the Argentine ant was present in higher numbers in flowers.  Cactus bees (Diadasia spp.), the key pollinators in this system, spent less time in flowers when cacti were occupied by the Argentine ant compared to when cacti were occupied by C. californica.  Presumably as a consequence of decreased duration of floral visits by Diadasia, cacti occupied by L. humile set fewer seeds per fruit & produced fewer seeds overall compared to cacti occupied by C. californica.  These data illustrate the importance of mutualist identity in cases where plants balance multiple mutualisms.  Moreover, as habitats become increasingly infiltrated by introduced species, the loss of native mutualists & their replacement by non-native species may alter the shape of trade-offs between plant defense & reproduction.]",

We need to approach future studies paying more attention to phylogenetic origins of the traits that we study.

Argentine ants contaminated with hydrocarbons extracted from S. longipalpa also released nestmate aggression behavior similar to that released by the whole prey item, confirming the involvement of hydrocarbons. In contrast to S. longipalpa, little or no nestmate aggression was induced by other ant prey from diverse taxa. A comparison of prey hydrocarbon profiles revealed that all hydrocarbons of S. longipalpa were very long chain components with 33 or more carbons, while other prey had either less, or none, of the very long chain hydrocarbons of 33 carbons or greater. We identified the hydrocarbons of S. longipalpa and some new groups of long chain hydrocarbons of L. humile. The majorities of S. longipalpa hydrocarbons were 35 and 37 carbons in length with one to three methyl branches, and closely resembled two previously unidentified groups of compounds from L. humile of similar chain length.

We focus on skeletomusculature, but additionally describe the metapleural & metasomal exocrine glands, & the morphology of the circulatory, digestive, reproductive, & nervous systems.  We describe the muscles of the dorsal vessel & the ducts of the venom & Dufour's gland, & characterize the visceral anal musculature.  Through comparison with other major ant lineages, apoid wasps, & other hymenopteran outgroups, we provide a first approximation of the complete abdominal skeletomuscular groundplan in Formicidae, with a nomenclatural schema generally applicable to the hexapod abdomen.  All skeletal muscles were identifiable with their homologs, while we observe potential apomorphies in the pregenital skeleton & the sting musculature.  Specifically, we propose the eighth coxocoxal muscle as an ant synapomorphy; we consider possible transformation series contributing to the distribution of states of the sternal apodemes in ants, Hymenoptera, & Hexapoda; & we address the possibly synapomorphic loss of the seventh sternal-eighth gonapophyseal muscles in the vespiform Aculeata.  We homologize the ovipositor muscles across Hymenoptera, & summarize demonstrated & hypothetical muscle functions across the abdomen.  We also give a new interpretation of the proximal processes of gonapophyses VIII & the ventromedial processes of gonocoxites IX, & make nomenclatural suggestions in the context of evolutionary anatomy & ontology.]          *[Amblyopone australis from Australia.

However, no accurate, direct, in situ validation of these extrapolations has been made on undisturbed animals. We present the first such validation here, on harvester ants (Messor pergandei). After measuring their energy parameters in the laboratory using a running tube, we measured the metabolic rate (MR) of a natural, undisturbed ant trail foraging through a respirometer chamber in the field. From temperature, ant numbers, ant masses, and foraging speeds (obtained through video analysis), we predicted trail MRs from separately obtained laboratory data and compared them to measured field trail MRs. No significant difference was found between actual field values and values predicted from equations produced from data acquired in the laboratory. Our results therefore serve to validate two unusual findings in ants, which would otherwise be troubling to extrapolate to field conditions: that their extrapolated MR at zero running speed does not differ from standard (resting) metabolic rate, and that their costs of transport are far lower than predicted on the basis of current allometric equations.",

Many arthropods are not so obliging and emit CO2 continuously, making cuticular and respiratory water losses difficult or impossible to partition.  We report here that by switching ambient air from 21 to 100% O2, marked spiracular constriction takes place, causing a transient but substantial - up to 90% - reduction in CO2 output.  A reduction in water loss rate occurs at the same time.  Using this approach, we investigated respiratory water loss in Drosophila melanogaster and in two ant species, Forelius mccooki and Pogonomyrmex californicus.  Our results,  respiratory water loss estimates of 23%, 7.6% and 5.6% of total water loss rates, respectively, are reasonable in light of literature estimates, and suggest that the 'hyperoxic switch' may allow straightforward estimation of respiratory water loss rates in arthropods lacking discontinuous gas exchange.

    "abstract": "This project sought to characterize plant defense investment in the castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), an exotic myrmecophyte in southern California, with respect to life history strategies. Experimental evidence suggests that exotic myrmecophytes can form mutually beneficial associations with exotic ants regardless of the differences in shared evolutionary histories. Castor bean plant investment in defense was evaluated by measuring the area on extra-floral nectary (EFN) glands. Life history strategies may change with respect to plant size and was therefore evaluated in terms of basal stem diameter (<50mm). We hypothesized that smaller and younger castor bean plants would have bigger EFN glands than larger and older plants. We found that EFN gland size was not correlated to castor bean class size. This suggests that in southern California, biotic plant defense is not optimized in castor bean plants. As an r-selected species, the castor bean plant compromises investment in plant defense favoring investment in growth and early reproduction.          *[In southern California, the castor bean plant attracts Argentine ants (Linepithema humile Mayr), an ant species native to South America.]",

    "abstract": "The ant genus Syscia  Roger, 1861 is part of the cryptic ant fauna inhabiting leaf litter and rotten wood in the Asian and American tropics. It is a distinct clade within the Dorylinae, the subfamily from which army ants arose. Prior to this work, the genus comprised seven species, each known from a single or very few collections. Extensive collecting in Middle America revealed an unexpected and challenging diversity of morphological forms. Locally distinct forms could be identified at many sites, but assignment of specimens to species spanning multiple sites was problematic. To improve species delimitation, Ultra-Conserved Element (UCE) phylogenomic data were sequenced for all forms, both within and among sites, and a phylogeny was inferred. Informed by phylogeny, species delimitation was based on monophyly, absence of within-clade sympatry, and a subjective degree of morphological uniformity. UCE phylogenomic results for 130 specimens were complemented by analysis of mitochondrial COI (DNA barcode) data for an expanded taxon set. The resulting taxonomy augments the number of known species in the New World from 3 to 57. We describe and name 31 new species, and 23 species are assigned morphospecies codes pending improved specimen coverage. Queens may be fully alate or brachypterous, and there is a wide variety of intercaste female forms. Identification based on morphology alone is very difficult due to continuous character variation and high similarity of phylogenetically distant species.

    "abstract": "*[This chapter is a review of data on structure, diversity, & adaptive properties of seasonal cycles in ants.  Most tropical ants demonstrate homodynamic development.  They do not show any developmental delays & all-year round the ontogenetic stages from egg to pupa exist in their nests.  Most temperate & all boreal climate ants are true heterodynamic.  They manifest a real winter diapause (prospective dormancy) in their annual cycle.  Thus, a variety of forms of dormancy, which were found in ants, extend from elementary quiescence to deep diapause.  Heterodynamic ants use 2 main seasonal strategies with respect to brood rearing: strategy of concentrated brood rearing (Formica type) & strategy of prolonged brood rearing (Aphaenogaster type, Myrmica type).  The larval stages at which diapause can occur are extremely variable among ants.  The evolution of seasonal life cycles & possible ways of origin of diapause in ants are discussed.  The subtropical (quasi-heterodynamic) and tropical (preadaptational) evolutionary paths to true heterodynamic development are considered.  It is concluded that similar seasonal adaptations could arise in the evolution of ants independently many times & usually are not tightly bound to the taxonomic position of species.]          *[Camponotus noveboracenis misspelled Camponotus noveboraceus; Prenolepis imparis inconsistently misspelled Prenolepis impairs; Tetramorium simillimum misspelled Tetramorium semillimum.]",

    "abstract": "Seed mucilage, a coating on seeds or fruit that becomes slimy and sticky when wet, has evolved convergently many times across plants. One common consequence of having seed mucilage is that sand and dirt particles stick to wet seeds and remain tightly bound to the seed surface after the mucilage dries. Here, we test the hypothesis that a mucilage\u0010bound sand coating protects the seed from seed predators; either as a physical barrier or by reducing apparency of the seed (i.e., camouflage). We experimentally manipulated the sand coating on seeds of 53 plant species of 13 families and assayed the defensive benefit of the sand coating in feeding 'depots' near harvester ant nests in California's Central Valley. Consistent with a defensive function, sand coating reduced ant predation on seeds in 48 of the 53 species examined. To test whether this striking benefit was due to reduced apparency, we conducted an addition experiment using flax seeds in which we factorially manipulated the color of both the background substrate and the sand coating, creating visually apparent and unapparent seeds. Our results did not support the reduced apparency hypothesis; seeds coated in background\u0010matched sand were removed at the same rate as seeds coated in unmatched sand. The defensive benefit of a sand coating was not well\u0010predicted by seed mass, entrapped sand mass, or sand mass scaled by seed mass. Together, our results demonstrate that seed mucilage is a phylogenetically widespread and effective seed defensive trait and point to the physical barrier, not reduced apparency, as a mechanism.",

    "abstract": "1. Ant-plant mutualisms have been the focus of considerable empirical research, but few studies have investigated how introduced ants affect these interactions. Using 2 years of survey data, this study examines how the introduced Argentine ant [Linepithema humile (Mayr)] differs from native ants with respect to its ability to protect the extrafloral nectary-bearing coast barrel cactus (Ferocactus viridescens) in Southern California.  2. Eighteen native ant species visited cacti in uninvaded areas, but cacti in invaded areas were primarily visited by the Argentine ant. The main herbivore of the coast barrel cactus present at the study sites is a leaf-footed bug (Narnia wilsoni).  3. Herbivore presence (the fraction of surveys in which leaf-footed bugs were present on individual cacti) was negatively related to ant presence (the fraction of surveys in which ants were present on individual cacti). Compared with cacti in uninvaded areas, those in invaded areas were less likely to have herbivores and when they did had them less often.  4. Seed mass was negatively related to herbivore presence, and this relationship did not differ for cacti in invaded areas versus those in uninvaded areas.  5. Although the Argentine ant might provide superior protection from herbivores, invasion-induced reductions in ant mutualist diversity could potentially compromise plant reproduction. The cumulative number of ant species on individual cacti over time was lower in invaded areas and was associated with a shortened seasonal duration of ant protection and reduced seed mass. These results support the hypothesis that multiple partners may enhance mutualism benefits.",

Ants were more likely to be observed on native, evergreen trees, suggesting that native evergreen species may help maintain ant diversity. Species showed clear patterns of temporal partitioning of foraging activity. Ant species varied in their use of native evergreen Quercus agrifolia trees across season and day/night axes. Of the 3 ant species most frequently observed, Camponotus semitestaceus was most active during spring and summer nights, Formica moki was most active during spring and summer days, and Prenolepis imparis was most active during both day and night during fall and winter.

    "abstract": "In this study we test whether Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) progressively reduce their response to a salient stimulus (alarm pheromone) with increased exposure over time. First, we used a two-chamber olfactometer to demonstrate three focal behaviors of Argentine ants that indicate an alarmed state in response to conspecific alarm pheromone and pure synthetic iridomyrmecin (a dominant component of L. humile alarm pheromone). We then measured how these behaviors changed after repeated exposure to conspecific alarm pheromone from live ants. In addition, we investigate whether there is a difference in the ants' behavioral response after 'short' (3 min) versus 'long' (6 min) intervals between treatments. Our results show that Argentine ants do exhibit reduced responses to their own alarm pheromone, temporarily ceasing their response to it after four or five exposures, and this pattern holds whether exposure is repeated after 'short' or 'long' intervals. We suggest alarm pheromones may be perceived as false alarms unless threatening stimuli warrant a continued state of alarm. These results should be kept in mind while developing pheromone-based integrated pest management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, scientists have headstarted threatened and endangered reptiles to augment depleted populations. Not all efforts have been successful. For the threatened Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), one challenge to recovery is poor recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, and this is being addressed through headstart programs. We evaluated 8 cohorts of juvenile desert tortoises from 1 to 8 yrs old in a headstart program at Edwards Air Force Base, California, for health, behavior, and growth. We also examined capacities of the headstart pens. Of 148 juveniles evaluated for health, 99.3% were below a prime condition index; 14.9% were lethargic and unresponsive; 59.5% had protruding spinal columns and associated concave scutes; 29.1% had evidence of ant bites; and 14.2% had moderate to severe injuries to limbs or shell. Lifetime growth rates for juveniles 1-8 yrs of age were approximately two times less than growth rates reported for wild populations. Tortoises in older cohorts had higher growth rates, and models indicated that high density in pens and burrow sharing negatively affected growth rates. Densities of tortoises in pens (205-2042/ha) were 350-3500 times higher than the average density recorded in the wild (<\t1/ha) for tortoises of similar sizes. The predominant forage species available to juveniles were alien annual grasses, which are nutritionally inadequate for growth. We conclude that the headstart pens were of inadequate size, likely contained too few shelters, and lacked the necessary biomass of preferred forbs to sustain the existing population. Additional factors to consider for future reptilian headstart pens include vegetative cover, food sources, soil seed banks, and soil composition.

Western widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus) predation on Pogonomyrmex rugosus ant nests is slight, less than 0.2% of the nest population per day. Yet, the ants respond by halting foraging temporarily and may even close the nest entrance with pebbles. If spiders are removed from such nests, the ants become active within 24 h and within five days foraging activity reaches higher levels than at any previous time of the year. Ants have at least four responses to spiders predation: 1) Moving the nest entrance; 2)posting of 'guards'; 3) attacking the spiders; 4) halting foraging. Pogonomyrmex rugosus practices the fourth response, although it results in losses of food intake into the nest. This is apparently the only option available. If the ants continue to forage, the spider density may increase, resulting in heavy mortality of the ants.",

Foragers and ants in the upper nest levels have highest mortality rates and low levels of fat content.

All three demonstrate similar seasonal patterns, with high foraging activity and high respiratory costs in mid-summer and little or no activity during winter. Respiration, predominantely metabolism of the workers, was estimated to account for 84-92% of the energy assimilated by the nests. The remaining 8-16% of the energy was invested in the production of new individuals. However, total production was not correlated with food input. It is suggested that worker care of the brood may be the most important determinant of brood production, and thus food may not be a direct limiting resource in harvester ants. A higher percentage of production is invested in workers than in reproductives in all three species. The species usually partition similar proportions of energy between the production of males and females, but since females are larger, more males are produced. Although the species are in different habitats and have very different numbers of workers per nest, the numbers of sexuals produced per nest are similar. The sex-ratio appear to be ecologically determined. Nests that were provided with additional food invested more energy in the production of males. Control nests, nests which had the food removed and older nests invested equally in the production of the two sexes.",

Evidence from nest excavations & observation of worker behavior indicate a decrease in seed stores in spring, which are replenished in summer & fall.  These results are in accordance with predictions from calculations of daily energy input & energy expenditure for an entire ant colony per year.  Three hypotheses are rejected by the data: 1) The seeds are not utilized during the winter when foraging is impossible. 2) The ants do not use the seeds in order to have a ready source of raw material for rapid production of new individuals.  3) Seed stores are not \"insurance\" in an unpredictable environment.   The data support a fourth hypothesis: Seed stores may be protection against predation, especially by spiders.  When predation becomes moderate, the ants are able to simply stop foraging & even close the nest with pebbles & wait until the spiders move to more active ant nests.]",

It is usually assumed that paradoxical acclimation reduces energy expenditures during unfavorable seasons.  There is no evidence that this occurs in the harvester ants. The ants are able to be active only during a portion of the year, a time in which they raise new workers and reproductives. Laboratory acclimation and field acclimatization studies suggest that ants of all three species increase their metabolism during this time.  The increase in above ground activity in summer may result in greater efficiency in the nest in producing new workers and reproductive females and males. Inverse acclimation in these ants does not decrease energy expenditures during unfavorable seasons. In most investigations of ants, the nest is implicitly asumed to be a homogeneous mixture of individuals. One unexpected result of a comparison of nest level is that nests are stratified in terms of important physiological parameters. Stratification within the nest implies there is little vertical mixing and as a result individuals from different levels were analyzed separately.",

Here, we present evidence of a potentially more important means of dispersal over longer distances (>1 m). We first confirmed that crawlers of four species of Diaspididae [Abgrallaspis aguacatae Evans, Watson & Miller; Hemiberlesia lataniae (Signoret); Aspidiotus nerii BouchÈ; and Diaspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock)] have four hairs on the end of each of their legs and that each of these hairs ends in a suction cup-like structure, reminiscent of the attachment structures possessed by phoretic mites. In a controlled environment, using crawlers of A. nerii, we then showed that the crawlers use these structures to attach themselves to three different insect species [Musca domestica L., Cryptolaemus montrozieri Mulsant and Linepithema humile (Mayr)] and can effectively be moved phoretically by these insects. Crawlers can remain attached to flying insects for considerable periods of time, suggesting that this may be an important means of dispersal for armored scale insects. The importance of phoresy for diaspidid dispersal in the field remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "When ants encounter a previously unexplored area, a variety of search patterns are possible. Previous studies have found that subsequent individuals tend to follow those that have gone before. This suggests that ants leave signature marks as they walk, independent of having encountered food, and that others recognize these and follow. This experiment tested if Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) also exhibit this pattern of behavior. Series of workers individually navigated through a grid consisting of two consecutive right-versus-left decisions. The resulting pattern does not significantly differ from random choice, as workers are neither more nor less likely to choose the path taken by a previous ant. The time between decisions also does not predict the path chosen. Either L. humile does not mark as they walk or workers do not use such marks in guiding their exploratory behavior. Under natural conditions, this suggests that L. humile is more expansive in initially distributing its workers across novel ground and less likely to have them clump together than species that do follow each other. This has implications for how the relative effectiveness in finding versus exploiting and defending food sites might vary across species.",

The focus of this study was to use molecular phylogenetic analysis of 781 base pairs of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) & 251 base pairs of an anonymous nuclear gene (ANG) to address questions about the evolutionary relationships of North American Lasius species & subgenera.  These relationships were used to better understand the biological & evolutionary complexities associated with these species given their North American distributions.  The resulting hypotheses generated in this study from the analyses of these genes produced unexpected patterns of phylogenetic placement of Lasius species & subgenera.

Laboratory studies primarily involved the use of the radioisotope p32 to label various foods, which could be subsequently traced as they were distributed by the ants of a colony.  The exchange of foods by regurgitation took place very readily among workers within the colony.  The distribution of food depended upon several factors: the type of food, the degree of hunger of the colony, & the temperature.  In the laboratory, a normal worker weighing 443 mg would carry an average of 193 mg of liquid food into a nest & directly pass it to 4 to 12 other workers.  These acceptor workers in turn passed it on to still other workers, until in 48 hours it would have reached as many as 156 other workers, or the brood & queens.  When sugars were introduced into the nest, they were retained & utilized primarily by the workers.  Very little was fed directly to the queens or larvae.  With proteins, much more of the food reached the larvae, but considerable amount were also fed directly to the queens & relatively smaller amounts utilized by the workers.  A third category of foods, glandular secretions of the ant's pharyngeal glands, accounted for only a small portion of the food within the colony, but the function of this specialized food may be of major importance to the colony.  The glandular secretions, which were produced by the workers, were either fed directly to the recipients or possibly swallowed, mixed with other foods in the crop, & regurgitated.  The primary recipients of the glandular secretions were the queens & small larvae, with lesser amounts reaching the larger larvae, & comparatively small amounts reaching the other workers.]",

Foraging was primarily restricted to the tree near which each nest was located.  Honeydew & nectar comprised more than 99% of the material carried into the nest by workers.

When the daily temperature extreme was between 15degrees and 30degreesC, activity continued at a high rate both day & night.  When the temperature exceeded 30degreesC, a drop in activity was noted.

The seasonal low in the life cycle occurs from January to February, when workers constitute above 90% of the biomass of the colony with the remaining 10% composed of either queens or overwintering worker brood (which completes its development by mid-March).  The new seasonal life cycle begins in late February to early March with the production of a large number of eggs.  This 1st group of eggs gives rise primarily to sexual forms, which subsequently mature during May.  Mating occurs within the nest shortly after the females have emerged from pupae.  After mating, the females shed their wings, join in the polygynous colony, & immediately begin to lay fertile eggs.  The number of queens in the nest remains fairly constant until January or February of the following year when about 75% of the queens are eliminated by workers in a form of colony regulation.  Worker production starts about mid-March with the laying of eggs that will give rise to the 1st worker brood of the season.  Worker numbers increase throughout the year with worker brood forming 50% or more of the colony biomass through the summer months of July, August, & September.  Production of worker brood drops very sharply in October when the worker population itself is at a seasonal high.  With no replacements from brood, the worker population decreases steadily over the winter months, reaching its lowest level the following March or April.]",

All 3 ant species reduced percentage parasitism by C. bifasciata and both percentage parasitism and host mutilation by A. melinus. Southern fire ant was the least disruptive and native gray ant the most disruptive. Southern fire ant removed 12% of scale from the lemons, presumably to feed on them, while the other ant species did not exhibit significant removal of scale compared to the controls. Percentage parasitism of California red scale exhibited by C. bifasciata was more than 2-fold the level exhibited by A. melinus. Percentage mutilation of California red scale, including probing and host feeding, was nearly 5-fold higher for A. melinus than C. bifasciata. Because A. melinus required a longer total host examination + oviposition period in the absence of ants than C. bifasciata and because oviposition occurs as the last act in a sequence of behaviors, disruption by the ants had a more significant negative effect on oviposition by A. melinus.",

    "note": "Part of FORMIS 09; from-DPW, verified-DPW.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ants of the genus Lasius are ecologically important and an important system for evolutionary research. Progress in evolutionary research has been hindered by the lack of a well-founded phylogeny of the subgenera, with three previous attempts disagreeing. Here we employed two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 16S ribosomal RNA), comprising 1,265 bp, together with 64 morphological characters, to recover the phylogeny of Lasius by Bayesian and Maximum Parsimony inference after exploration of potential causes of phylogenetic distortion. We use the resulting framework to infer evolutionary pathways for social parasitism and fungiculture.   RESULTS: We recovered two well supported major lineages. One includes Acanthomyops, Austrolasius, Chthonolasius, and Lasius pallitarsis, which we confirm to represent a seventh subgenus, the other clade contains Dendrolasius, and Lasius sensu stricto. The subgenus Cautolasius, displaying neither social parasitism nor fungiculture, probably belongs to the second clade, but its phylogenetic position is not resolved at the cutoff values of node support we apply. Possible causes for previous problems with reconstructing the Lasius phylogeny include use of other reconstruction techniques, possibly more prone to instabilities in some instances, and the inclusion of phylogenetically distorting characters.    CONCLUSION: By establishing an updated phylogenetic framework, our study provides the basis for a later formal taxonomic revision of subgenera and for studying the evolution of various ecologically and sociobiologically relevant traits of Lasius, although there is need for future studies to include nuclear genes and additional samples from the Nearctic. Both social parasitism and fungiculture evolved twice in Lasius, once in each major lineage, which opens up new opportunities for comparative analyses. The repeated evolution of social parasitism has been established for other groups of ants, though not for temporary social parasitism as found in Lasius. For fungiculture, the independent emergence twice in a monophyletic group marks a novel scenario in ants. We present alternative hypotheses for the evolution of both traits, with one of each involving loss of the trait. Though less likely for both traits than later evolution without reversal, we consider reversal as sufficiently plausible to merit independent testing.",

    "abstract": "*[In the first chapter, I review the literature on chemical & visual cues that one natural enemy of the ant, the phorid fly, uses to successfully parasitized its host ants.  I outline the 5 common steps in which phorid flies use cues: (a) host habitat location, (b) host location, (c) host acceptance, (d) host discrimination, & (e) host regulation.  I examine the wide variety of strategies & cues used by a multiple species of phorid flies in 3 separate genera (Apocephalus, Pseudacteon, Neodohrniphora).  In the second chapter, I investigate the role of Azteca ant cuticular hydrocarbon cues as a short-range cue for a suite of Pseudacteon spp. phorid fly parasitoids commonly found within coffee agroecosystems.  I describe the hierarchy of cues Pseudacteon spp. phorid flies use to successfully identify Azteca host ants.  I use behavioral observations in the field to show phorid flies are attracted to 2 cryptic Azteca taxa, but will only attack Azteca sericeasur.  To test whether the phorid flies are able to distinguish between the 2 Azteca taxa using their cuticular hydrocarbons, I document & compare the cuticular hydrocarbons of 2 cryptic Azteca taxa using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.  Using cuticular hydrocarbon transfer experiments with live ants from both Azteca taxa, I identify the cuticular hydrocarbons of Azteca sericeasur as a short-range host location cue used by Pseudacteon lasciniosus (Diptera: Phoridae) to locate the ants.  In the third chapter, I describe 2 new species of Myrmedonota (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) that are also natural enemies of Azteca sericeasur ants.  I record this beetle genus in Mexico for the first time, and describe M. xipe and M. shimmerale.  This chapter also documents that both Myrmedonota species will aggregate towards agitated ants, to prey on Azteca sericeasur, & these species will form mating swarms, either with no apparent landmark or in the vicinity of ants.  The fourth chapter examines the role of the beetle, Myrmedonota xipe, in Azteca ant-phorid fly interactions.  I use pheromone bioassays to show that M. xipe is attracted to a component of A. sericeasur alarm pheromone.  In field experiments, I determine that the beetles are able to locate parasitized ants as prey items, but not healthy ants.  In choice tests in the lab, I show that beetles will preferentially attack parasitized ants over healthy ants.  Analysis of the choice tests also indicates that the aggression in parasitized ants is so reduced that beetles are essentially able to eat these ants alive without interruption.  These results suggest that, although beetles are predators of the ants, by preying primarily on ants harboring phorid fly eggs, the beetles may also provide indirect positive effects for the ant colonies as a whole.  In the final chapter, I examine the variation in cuticular hydrocarbon blends of 3 species of arboreal twig nesting ants, Pseudomyrmex simplex, Pseudomyrmex ejectus, & Pseudomyrmex sp. (referred to as PSW-53) commonly found within the coffee agroecosystems of Southern Mexico.  In this study, I examined whether variation in the ecology & social structure of these species is reflected in the variation in their cuticular hydrocarbon profiles.  I tested the hypothesis that the more abundant species with higher nest densities exhibit lower cuticular hydrocarbon variation.  The results showed that worker ants (of abundant P. ejectus & P. simplex from the study site) exhibit significantly lower variation in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles than workers of the rare species P. PSW-53.]",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of broad-scale wildfire on ground foraging ants within southern California. In October and November of 2003, two wildfires burned large portions of the wildlands within San Diego County. Between January 2005 and September 2006, we surveyed 63 plots across four sites to measure the effect of the fires on the ant assemblages present in four vegetation types: 1) coastal sage scrub, 2) chaparral, 3) grassland, and 4) woodland riparian. Thirty-six of the 63 plots were sampled before the fires between March 2001 and June 2003. Mixed model regression analyses, accounting for the burn history of each plot and our pre- and postfire sampling efforts, revealed that fire had a negative effect on ant species diversity. Multivariate analyses showed that ant community structure varied significantly among the four vegetation types, and only the ant assemblage associated with coastal sage scrub exhibited a significant difference between burned and unburned samples. The most notable change detected at the individual species level involved Messor andrei (Mayr), which increased from <1% of prefire coastal sage scrub ant samples to 32.1% in burned plots postfire. We theorize that M. andrei responded to the increase of bare ground and postfire seed production, leading to an increase in the detection rate for this species. Collectively, our results suggest that wildfires can have short-term impacts on the diversity and community structure of ground foraging ants in coastal sage scrub. We discuss these findings in relation to management implications and directions for future research.

A multi-season liquid baiting program was evaluated for control of L. humile & ant-associated hemipteran pests in 6 commercial citrus orchards in southern California.  Ant activity in treated trees fell by 96% within 3 months of treatment & was, on average, 95% lower in treated plots than untreated plots across the 18-month study period.  Ant control resulted in the near elimination of hemipteran pest populations on trees in treated plots.  Pre- & post-treatment estimates indicated that hemipteran pest infestation of twigs, flush, & fruit decreased by 97, 84, & 99% one year after treatment, respectively.  Cumulative infestation frequency was 10 times lower & cumulative colony size was 5 times lower on treated trees than control trees across the final year of study.  Examining individual hemipteran pest species, the mean infestation rate by Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) was 75% lower, Coccus hesperidum L. (Hemiptera: Coccidae) 95% lower, Planococcus citri Risso (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) 98%-100% lower, and Aonidiella aurantii Maskell (Hemiptera: Diaspidae) 70-80% lower in treated trees relative to untreated trees.  A surge in generalist predator activity and parasitism following ant bait deployment appear to be the driving forces behind the marked decrease in pest infestation observed in treated trees.

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), poses a significant economic threat to citrus production in southern California. Broad-spectrum insecticide sprays provide poor ant control and present a hazard to human and environmental health. Liquid sucrose bait infused with a low concentration of insecticide is an effective alternative treatment but current approaches require considerable economic investment in plastic dispensers and continual maintenance. To produce a baiting product for control of L. humile suitable for large-scale application, a biodegradable, broadcastable alginate hydrogel for delivery of aqueous low-dose thiamethoxam sucrose bait was developed and evaluated in replicated field trials in commercial citrus groves. Ant activity was significantly reduced in hydrogel-treated trees. Peak L. humile suppression was achieved 48 h following the final hydrogel disbursement, with an estimated 91% reduction in activity from baseline estimates and a 17-fold lower activity in treated trees in comparison with untreated trees. Significant residual activity of the hydrogel treatments was recorded, with a nearly 70% reduction from pre-treatment levels persisting at least 3 weeks after the last application. We conclude that alginate hydrogels can provide excellent control of L. humile while deploying 99.99% less insecticide into orchards than commercial barrier spray treatments.",

The contribution of each factor to the overall variability of six community characters was evaluated by the ANOVA procedure. The mediod revealed absence of convergence in three-continent and pairwise-continent analyses in almost every community attribute that was measured. Significant convergence was detected only in die foraging score for the North America-South America comparison. This implies mat the foraging mode used by ants for searching seeds is more similar within similar environments in the two continents than between different environments in the same continent. Significant historical effects were much more prevalent than convergence both in three-continent and pairwise-continent comparisons. Abundance at baits, body size, and foraging distance were more variable within similar environments in different continents than between different environments in the same continent. The overall absence of convergence documented in this study suggests that constraints related to the evolutionary history of each species assemblage have inhibited convergent evolution in response to local selective pressures.",

    "abstract": "A major problem in evolutionary biology is explaining the success of mutualism. Solving this problem requires understanding the level of fidelity between interacting partners. Recent studies have proposed that fungus-growing ants and their fungal cultivars are the products of  'diffuse' coevolution, in which single ant and fungal species are not exclusive to one another. Here we show for ants and associated fungi in the Cyphomyrmex wheeleri species group that each ant species has been exclusively associated with a single fungal cultivar 'species' for millions of years, even though alternative cultivars are readily available, and that rare shifts to new cultivars are associated with ant speciation. Such long-term partner fidelity may have facilitated 'tight' ant-fungus coevolution, and shifts to new fungal cultivars may have had a role in the origin of new ant species.

    "abstract": "Although the ecological success of introduced species hinges on biotic interactions and physical conditions, few experimental studies\u0014especially on animals\u0014have simultaneously investigated the relative importance of both types of factors. The lack of such research may stem from the common assumption that native and introduced species exhibit similar environmental tolerances. Here we combine experimental and spatial modeling approaches (1) to determine the relative importance of biotic and abiotic controls of Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) invasion success, (2) to examine how the importance of these factors changes with spatial scale in southern California (USA), and (3) to assess how Argentine ants differ from native ants in their environmental tolerances. A factorial field experiment that combined native ant removal with irrigation revealed that Argentine ants failed to invade any dry plots (even those lacking native ants) but readily invaded all moist plots. Native ants slowed the spread of Argentine ants into irrigated plots but did not prevent invasion. In areas without Argentine ants, native ant species showed variable responses to irrigation. At the landscape scale, Argentine ant occurrence was positively correlated with minimum winter temperature (but not precipitation), whereas native ant diversity increased with precipitation and was negatively correlated with minimum winter temperature. These results are of interest for several reasons. First, they demonstrate that fine\u0010scale differences in the physical environment can eclipse biotic resistance from native competitors in determining community susceptibility to invasion. Second, our results illustrate surprising complexities with respect to how the abiotic factors limiting invasion can change with spatial scale, and third, how native and invasive species can differ in their responses to the physical environment. Idiosyncratic and scale\u0010dependent processes complicate attempts to forecast where introduced species will occur and how their range limits may shift as a result of climate change.",

Because drip irrigation stimulated plant growth, in an additional experiment, we manipulated both soil moisture & plant cover to assess the direct vs indirect effects of added water on the abundance of L. humile.  Local abundance of Argentine ants increased in irrigated plots, but was 38% higher in irrigated plots with plants compared to irrigated plots, where plant growth was suppressed.  The results of this experiment argue for a direct role of soil moisture in influencing Argentine ant abundance, but suggest that the indirect effects of added water may also be important.  Our study illustrates that fine-scale variation in the physical environment can control whether communities can become invaded by non-native species.  It also suggests that an understanding of community susceptibility to invasion will be improved by a better appreciation of interactions between the biotic & abiotic environment.]",

    "abstract": "Predicting changes in the abundance and distribution of introduced species over time is difficult, but clues regarding the underlying causes of these changes may come from long-term surveys. Resurveys conducted over large spatial scales, for example, can be used to discriminate between site-specific causes of decline and those that act at the population level. Here we used regional resurvey data to address changes in Argentine ant site occupancy in urban, agricultural, and natural environments in coastal southern California. We resurveyed 145 locations originally sampled 12-14 years ago and observed a slight decrease in Argentine ant site occupation, from 85 to 79% across all sites. At the majority of sites where apparent absences were recorded, however, the Argentine ant had merely retreated outside of the proscribed sampling area (a 25-m radius circle) and was still present within 80 m, on average, of the original sampling point. This finding thus suggests that the apparent absences observed most likely reflect contractions of the area occupied by polydomous supercolonies, possibly in response to local-scale changes in environmental conditions, as opposed to processes acting at larger spatial scales. We also conducted back-to-back annual resurveys (in 2018 and 2019) of all urban sampling points (n\t=\t95) to quantify annual turnover in site occupancy. These resurveys revealed 2.4% site turnover with 97% (92/95) sites being classified as either presences (n\t=\t85) or absences (n\t=\t7) in both years. Our results support the findings of resurveys conducted in northern California, where Argentine ant distributions have slowly expanded over decadal time scales. Historical resurveys can provide insights into why populations of introduced species change over time and should incorporate an appreciation of how invader traits affect detectability.",

    "abstract": "Aim: Species distribution models (SDMs) or, more specifically, ecological niche models (ENMs) are a useful and rapidly proliferating tool in ecology and global change biology. ENMs attempt to capture associations between a species and its environment and are often used to draw biological inferences, to predict potential occurrences in unoccupied regions and to forecast future distributions under environmental change. The accuracy of ENMs, however, hinges critically on the quality of occurrence data. ENMs often use haphazardly collected data rather than data collected across the full spectrum of existing environmental conditions. Moreover, it remains unclear how processes affecting ENM predictions operate at different spatial scales. The scale (i.e. grain size) of analysis may be dictated more by the sampling regime than by biologically meaningful processes. The aim of our study is to jointly quantify how issues relating to region and scale affect ENM predictions using an economically important and ecologically damaging invasive species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile).  Location: California, USA.  Methods We analysed the relationship between sampling sufficiency, regional differences in environmental parameter space and cell size of analysis and resampling environmental layers using two independently collected sets of presence/absence data. Differences in variable importance were determined using model averaging and logistic regression. Model accuracy was measured with area under the curve (AUC) and Cohen's kappa.  Results: We first demonstrate that insufficient sampling of environmental parameter space can cause large errors in predicted distributions and biological interpretation. Models performed best when they were parametrized with data that sufficiently sampled environmental parameter space. Second, we show that altering the spatial grain of analysis changes the relative importance of different environmental variables. These changes apparently result from how environmental constraints and the sampling distributions of environmental variables change with spatial grain.  Conclusions: These findings have clear relevance for biological inference. Taken together, our results illustrate potentially general limitations for ENMs, especially when such models are used to predict species occurrences in novel environments. We offer basic methodological and conceptual guidelines for appropriate sampling and scale matching.

    "abstract": "Studies of food webs often employ stable isotopic approaches to infer trophic position and interaction strength without consideration of spatio-temporal variation in resource assimilation by constituent species. Using results from laboratory diet manipulations and monthly sampling of field populations, we illustrate how nitrogen isotopes may be used to quantify spatio-temporal variation in resource assimilation in ants. First, we determined nitrogen enrichment using a controlled laboratory experiment with the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). After 12 weeks, worker delta15N values from colonies fed an animal-based diet had delta15N values that were 5.51% greater compared to colonies fed a plant-based diet. The shift in delta15N values in response to the experimental diet occurred within 10 weeks. We next reared Argentine ant colonies with or without access to honeydew-producing aphids and found that after 8 weeks workers from colonies without access to aphids had delta15N values that were 6.31% larger compared to colonies with access to honeydew. Second, we sampled field populations over a 1-year period to quantify spatio-temporal variability in isotopic ratios of L. humile and those of a common native ant (Solenopsis xyloni). Samples from free-living colonies revealed that fluctuations in delta15N were 1.6-2.4-0/100 for L. humile and 1.8-2.9-0/100 for S. xyloni. Variation was also detected among L. humile castes: time averaged means of delta15N varied from 1.2 to 2.5 depending on the site, with delta15N values for queens - workers more than brood. The estimated trophic positions of L. humile and S. xyloni were similar within a site; however, trophic position for each species differed significantly at larger spatial scales. While stable isotopes are clearly useful for examining the trophic ecology of arthropod communities, our results suggest that caution is warranted when making ecological interpretations when stable isotope collections come from single time periods or life stages.",

    "abstract": "The ecological effects of species introductions can change in magnitude over time, but an understanding of how and why they do so remains incompletely understood. Clarifying this issue requires consideration of how temporal variation in invader traits affects invasion impacts (e.g., through differential effects on the diversity and composition of native species assemblages). We examine the temporal dynamics of Argentine ant invasions in northern California by resurveying 202 sites first sampled 30-40 yr ago. To test how invasion impacts change over time, we estimated native ant richness and species composition at 20 riparian woodland sites that span a 30\u0010yr invasion chronosequence. We then use these data to test how variation in two invader traits (aggression and relative abundance) is related to time since invasion and invasion impact. Native ant assemblages along the chronosequence exhibited reduced native ant richness and altered species composition (compared to uninvaded control sites), but the magnitude of these impacts was independent of time since invasion. These results are corroborated by additional temporal comparisons of native ant assemblages at riparian sites sampled 20-30 yr ago. Our findings together illustrate that the impacts of invasions can persist undiminished over at least a 30\u0010yr time frame and remain evident at regional scales. Although neither invader trait varied with time since invasion, native ant richness declined as the relative abundance of the Argentine ant increased. This latter result supports the hypothesis that factors reducing invader abundance at particular sites can decrease invasion impacts, but also that such changes may be due to site\u0010specific factors (e.g., abiotic conditions) that affect invader abundance rather than time since invasion per se. Future studies should attempt to differentiate factors that are intrinsic to the process of invasion (e.g., changes in invader populations) from long\u0010term environmental changes (e.g., climate change) that represent extrinsic influences on the dynamics of invasion.",

Peri-urban areas in particular are at high risk of reductions in ant biodiversity due to development. To document and evaluate ant species diversity and richness in a rapidly developing area, nine sites were sampled within areas of coastal sage scrub (CSS) encircling the urban periphery of Ensenada, Baja California. Forty species and 17 genera of ants were collected, only one of which was non-native. Although the sampled area represents less than 1% of the peninsula and 3% of the State of Baja California, approximately one-third of the total species recorded for the peninsula and state were collected. Environmental variables (compass orientation, slope, and vegetation cover) were not significant determinants of species richness. Sandy soils were associated with the highest species abundance, richness, and functional diversity of feeding guilds.

However, not all interactions are the same. The type of interaction (e.g. affiliative or agonistic) and the state of the individual one interacts with may impact the information provided. Here we asked whether the decisions of ants to forage are determined by individual or social information and whether the type of social interaction experienced impacts these decisions. We found that foragers of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, relied predominantly on local interactions of particular types when deciding whether or not to continue foraging. Specifically, the time a forager spent in the nest was affected by the proportion of trophallactic interactions it experienced but not by other types of interactions. Furthermore, latency to leave the nest was only affected by the proportion of trophallactic interactions with hungry ants and not by other interactions or by personal information. Finally, global colony hunger level did not affect a forager's decision to continue foraging. Thus, the type of interaction and the state of the individual one interacts with impact decision making. Therefore, when examining the emergence of collective outcomes from local interactions, it is important to consider the nature of these interactions and not only their rate or quantity.",

    "abstract": "Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), disrupts biological control services in California citrus orchards, leading to economically damaging densities of honeydew\u0010producing hemipteran pests. With the elimination of chlorpyrifos, the sole registered insecticide for L.\thumile control in California citrus, the development of effective alternatives is necessary. One alternative is aqueous sugar baits laced with minute concentrations (0.0001%) of insecticide. Field trials were conducted to assess the efficacy of spinosad and thiamethoxam\u0010infused alginate hydrogel beads (HGBs) for L.\thumile control. Thiamethoxam\u0010infused HGBs have previously shown high efficacy against L.\thumile in citrus. Spinosad is approved for organic use, while thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid, along with other neonicotinoid insecticides, might soon face deregistration in California, underscoring the need for alternative insecticide chemistries for ant control. Therefore, this study aimed to optimize spinosad\u0010loaded HGBs by identifying efficacious concentrations, application rates, and deployment frequency, and to compare with thiamethoxam\u0010infused HGBs, the standard reference treatment. Results showed that spinosad\u0010infused HGBs significantly reduced high\u0010density L.\thumile populations in citrus orchards. Notably, the highest spinosad concentration tested (0.01%) demonstrated comparable control to both 0.0001% and 0.01% thiamethoxam concentrations. A tri\u0010weekly application schedule for spinosad\u0010infused HGBs provided best control. Trees treated with 125 or 250\tg of hydrogels infused with 0.01% spinosad at weeks 0, 3, and 6 displayed significantly reduced ant activities compared to plots treated solely during weeks 0 and 6, as well as control plots lacking HGB applications. Spinosad\u0010infused HGBs may offer an effective alternative to thiamethoxam\u0010infused HGBs for control of L.\thumile in California citrus orchards.",

Densities of D. citri eggs, nymphs, and adults, and Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a mutualist which defends psyllid nymphs from natural enemies, citrus flush growth patterns, and parasitism rates of T. radiata, were monitored every four weeks on grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange, and tangerine trees at 28 urban sites across three climate types (coastal, intermediate, and desert). Significant spatial and temporal effects on D. citri abundance and parasitism rates were observed over this four-year period. Highest D. citri densities and parasitism rates were found in the intermediate and coastal regions during peaks of flushing cycles of citrus plants over March-June and September-November each year. Over the course of this study, population densities of D. citri declined by over 75%. Parasitism by T. radiata was identified as a significant mortality factor often exceeding 60% during periods of peak parasitoid activity. Analyses indicated that parasitism resulted in delayed density-dependent mortality and subsequent reductions in D. citri densities lagged by ~ 1 yr. Trends in D. citri densities and parasitism rates over time were similar on grapefruit, lemons, limes, oranges, and tangerines. Presence of L. humile in citrus resulted in a 3-fold increase in D. citri densities and control of this pest ant is needed to maximize biological control of D. citri.",

However, invasive ants that exploit floral nectar in these landscapes can compete with bees for resources, with implications for pollinator resource acquisition, plant fitness, and, ultimately, ecosystem function. While interference competition has been described between bees and nectivorous, non-pollinator antagonists, the behaviors and sensory mechanisms involved remain largely unresolved. Here, we studied the mechanisms by which invasive Argentine ants influence bee nectar foraging behavior. In a series of laboratory assays, we assessed the foraging behavior of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) in response to live Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) or to a subset of ant chemical cues. Bees were clearly deterred by live ants at a nectar source: they consumed less, fed less frequently, and fed for a shorter duration when live ants were present. Bees were also deterred by a combination of olfactory and gustatory ant chemical cues, consistent with both innate and learned avoidance behavior. NaÔve and ant-experienced bees were deterred through chemosensation of ants, feeding less from nectar infused with ant chemicals as compared to nectar lacking ants or their associated cues. Some ant-experienced bees showed a unique behavior, displaying aggression toward ants as well as in response to ant chemicals. The marked effects of this invasive ant on bee foraging behavior\u0014through physical interaction and chemical cues\u0014highlights Argentine ants as a serious pest whose control should be considered when developing pollinator conservation and management strategies.",

    "abstract": "In the United States multispecies habitat conservation plans were meant to be the solution to conflicts between economic development and protection of biological diversity. Although now widely applied, questions exist concerning the scientific credibility of the conservation planning process and effectiveness of the plans. We used ants to assess performance of one of the first regional conservation plans developed in the United States, the Orange County Central-Coastal Natural Community Conservation Plan (NCCP), in meeting its broader conservation objectives of biodiversity and ecosystem-level protection. We collected pitfall data on ants for over 3 years on 172 sites established across a network of conservation lands in coastal southern California. Although recovered native ant diversity for the study area was high, site-occupancy models indicated the invasive and ecologically disruptive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) was present at 29% of sites, and sites located within 200 m of urban and agricultural areas were more likely to have been invaded. Within invaded sites, native ants were largely displaced, and their median species richness declined by more than 60% compared with uninvaded sites. At the time of planning, 24% of the 15,133-ha reserve system established by Orange County NCCP fell within 200 m of an urban or agricultural edge. With complete build out of lands surrounding the reserve, the proportion of the reserve system vulnerable to invasion will grow to 44%. Our data indicate that simply protecting designated areas from development is not enough. If habitat conservation plans are to fulfill their conservation promise of ecosystem-level protection, a more-integrated and systematic approach to the process of habitat conservation planning is needed.

    "abstract": "As invasive species are key threats to ecosystem structure and function, it is essential to understand the factors underlying their success. Enigmatically, mutualistic organisms are often successful in colonizing novel environments even though they commonly persist only through intricate relationships with other species. Mutualistic ants, for example, protect aphids from natural enemies while collecting carbohydrate-rich honeydew. To facilitate this interaction, ants have evolved aggressive responses to aphid alarm pheromone emissions. As invasive and native mutualists have not evolved together, however, it is unclear if this form of cross-species communication exists between these two parties thereby facilitating these novel interactions.  We address this hypothesis by assessing whether the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, responds to native poplar aphid, Chaitophorus populicola, alarm signals. Here, we show that interspecific signaling does exist in this newly established mutualistic interaction. Argentine ant workers exhibit increased aggression and double the number of visits to an aphid colony after an aphid alarm signal is emitted. We suggest that pre-adaptations may facilitate the emergence of mutualistic associations between many invasive and native species.",

In defensive mutualistic associations, reduced risk of predation should permit defended organisms to produce phenotypes with higher offspring production than non-mutualistic, unprotected conspecifics which require costly defensive traits. 2. Here, we show that cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii, which produce any combination of dwarf apterae (low intrinsic rate of increase), light green apterae (medium intrinsic rate of increase), dark green apterae (high intrinsic rate of increase) and alatae (winged dispersal morphs), alter offspring phenotypes when tended by predatory ants. 3. Aphids tended by the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, have similar numbers of dwarf, dark green and alate offspring, but greater numbers of light green offspring, compared to untended colonies. 4. Because light green morphs have a higher intrinsic rate of increase than dwarf morphs but a decreased risk of parasitism compared to dark green morphs, increased production of the light green phenotype may optimize offspring production in order to maximize clone fitness. 5. Since many organisms have high levels of plasticity and mutualistic interactions are ubiquitous, mutualist-induced polyphenisms may be pervasive.",

The tri-trophic interactions hypothesis predicts that dietary specialist herbivores (as compared to generalists) should escape predators & be competitively dominant due to faster growth rates, & that such differences should be greater on low quality (as compared to high quality) host plants.  To provide a preliminary test of these predictions, we conducted an empirical study comparing the effects of plant (Baccharis salicifolia) quality & predators between a specialist (Uroleucon macolai) & a generalist (Aphis gossypii) aphid herbivore.  Consistent with predictions, these 3 factors interactively determine herbivore performance in ways not addressed by existing hypotheses.  Compared to the specialist, the generalist was less fecund, competitively inferior, & more sensitive to low plant quality.  Correspondingly, predator effects were contingent upon plant quality only for the generalist.  Contrary to predictions, predator effects were weaker for the generalist & on low-quality plants, likely due to density-dependent benefits provided to the generalist by mutualist ants.  Ants, Linepithema humile, which are otherwise predatory, did not prey upon A. gossypii, but instead tended them (collected aphid honeydew in both open & closed cages).  Because the tri-trophic interactions hypothesis predicts the superior performance of specialists, mutualist ants may be critical to A. gossypii persistence under competition from U. macolai.]",

We sampled Argentine ants (Linepithema humile Mayr) within the saltwater and freshwater marshes of Ballona Wetlands in Los Angeles, CA.

Five months after planting, polycultures (versus monocultures) had increased abundances of aphids (3-fold), ants (3.2-fold), & parasitoids (1.7-fold) owing to non-additive effects of genetic diversity.  The effect on aphids was direct, as plant genetic diversity did not mediate ant-aphid, parasitoid-aphid or ant-parasitoid interactions.  This increase in aphid abundance occurred even though plant growth (& thus aphid resources) was not higher in polycultures.  The increase in ants & parasitoids was an indirect effect, due entirely to higher aphid abundance.

    "abstract": "In the Australian arid zone, the species richness of ants is greater and that of mammalian grainvores is less than in North American deserts. This study aimed to determine if the structure of harvester ant communities differs from that seen in North American deserts, focussing on differences related to the paucity of rodents. We tested three hypotheses: (1) because there are fewer rodents, Australian harvester ants should be more abundant and diverse in local habitats than in North American deserts of similar productivity; (2) because the absence of rodents would allow ants to use larger seeds that are preferred by rodents in North America, Australian ant communities should include a larger size range and contain larger workers; and (3) that apart from differences resulting from a paucity of rodents, Australian and North American communities would be convergent in characteristics of community structure resulting from competition. We sampled 19 communities across a climatic gradient in the Australian arid zone and compared the results with data previously obtained for 10 North American communities. Australian harvester ants exhibited similar alpha (within-habitat) diversity but higher beta (between-habitat) diversity between communities. Australian and North American communities were similar in species richness, species diversity, numbers of common species, and abundance of ants, although Australian communities tended to be richer and more diverse at sites with lower precipitation. North American communities increased in species richness, diversity, numbers of common species, and proportions of column-foraging species with increasing precipitation. In contrast, Australian communities did not change regularly across a gradient in precipitation. Thus, the first hypothesis was rejected. The second hypothesis was also rejected because Australian harvester ants were smaller, covered a smaller size range, and tended to be more tightly distributed along the size gradient. Dietary data indicated a lack of correspondence between resource use and availability, suggesting that Australian communities may not generally be in equilibrium with their resource environment. However, neither of the first two hypotheses could be tested unequivocally because it remains possible that evolutionary interaction between seeds and ants in the absence of rodents has allowed seeds to adopt defenses minimizing consumption by ants, or that other granivores (particularly birds) compensate in part for the paucity of rodents. Tests of the third hypothesis were ambiguous. Some results suggest basic similarities between the effects of competition on the communities, such as the similar maximum values for abundance, richness, and species diversity. However, several attributes of Australian communities differed from those in North America: foraging occurred over a wider range of soil temperatures; temporal displacement of foraging among coexisting species was prominent; and individually foraging species occurred with equal frequency across climatic gradients. We discuss various biotic and abiotic features that may explain differences in community structure between continents. We conclude that the paucity of rodents, a potentially competing group of granivores, has not led to predictable changes in harvester ant communities of arid Australia.          *[Uses previously published data from Davidson 1977, recalculates it to get indices.

    "abstract": "We present a phylogeographic study of at least six reproductively isolated lineages of new world harvester ants within the Pogonomyrmex barbatus and P. rugosus species group. The genetic and geographic relationships within this clade are complex: Four of the identified lineages show genetic caste determination (GCD) and are divided into two pairs. Each pair has evolved under a mutualistic system that necessitates sympatry. These paired lineages are dependent upon one another because their GCD requires interlineage matings for the production of F1 hybrid workers, and intralineage matings are required to produce queens. This GCD system maintains genetic isolation among these interdependent lineages, while simultaneously requiring co-expansion and emigration as their distributions have changed over time. It has also been demonstrated that three of these four GCD lineages have undergone historical hybridization, but the narrower sampling range of previous studies has left questions on the hybrid parentage, breadth, and age of these groups. Thus, reconstructing the phylogenetic and geographic history of this group allows us to evaluate past insights and hypotheses and to plan future inquiries in a more complete historical biogeographic context. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences sampled across most of the morphospecies' ranges in the U.S.A. and Mexico, we conducted a detailed phylogeographic study. Remarkably, our results indicate that one of the GCD lineage pairs has experienced a dramatic range expansion, despite the genetic load and fitness costs of the GCD system. Our analyses also reveal a complex pattern of vicariance and dispersal in Pogonomyrmex harvester ants that is largely concordant with models of late Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene range shifts among various arid-adapted taxa in North America.

    "abstract": "The obligate mutualism between leafcutter ants and their Attamyces fungi originated 8 to 12 million years ago in the tropics, but extends today also into temperate regions in South and North America. The northernmost leafcutter ant Atta texana sustains fungiculture during winter temperatures that would harm the cold-sensitive Attamyces cultivars of tropical leafcutter ants. Cold-tolerance of Attamyces cultivars increases with winter harshness along a south-to-north temperature gradient across the range of A. texana, indicating selection for cold-tolerant Attamyces variants along the temperature cline. Ecological niche modeling corroborates winter temperature as a key range-limiting factor impeding northward expansion of A. texana. The northernmost A. texana populations are able to sustain fungiculture throughout winter because of their cold-adapted fungi and because of seasonal, vertical garden relocation (maintaining gardens deep in the ground in winter to protect them from extreme cold, then moving gardens to warmer, shallow depths in spring). Although the origin of leafcutter fungiculture was an evolutionary breakthrough that revolutionized the food niche of tropical fungus-growing ants, the original adaptations of this host-microbe symbiosis to tropical temperatures and the dependence on cold-sensitive fungal symbionts eventually constrained expansion into temperate habitats. Evolution of cold-tolerant fungi within the symbiosis relaxed constraints on winter fungiculture at the northern frontier of the leafcutter ant distribution, thereby expanding the ecological niche of an obligate host-microbe symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Tropical leaf-cutter ants cultivate the fungus Attamyces bromatificus in a many-to-one, diffuse coevolutionary relationship where ant and fungal partners re-associate frequently over time. To evaluate whether ant-Attamyces coevolution is more specific (tighter) in peripheral populations, we characterized the host-specificities of Attamyces genotypes at their northern, subtropical range limits (southern USA, Mexico and Cuba). Population-genetic patterns of northern Attamyces reveal features that have so far not been observed in the diffusely coevolving, tropical ant-Attamyces associations. These unique features include (i) cases of one-to-one ant-Attamyces specialization that tighten coevolution at the northern frontier; (ii) distributions of genetically identical Attamyces clones over large areas (up to 81 000 km2, approx. the area of Ireland, Austria or Panama); (iii) admixture rates between Attamyces lineages that appear lower in northern than in tropical populations; and (iv) long-distance gene flow of Attamyces across a dispersal barrier for leaf-cutter ants (ocean between mainland North America and Cuba). The latter suggests that Attamyces fungi may occasionally disperse independently of the ants, contrary to the traditional assumption that Attamyces fungi depend entirely on leaf-cutter queens for dispersal. Peripheral populations in Argentina or at mid-elevation sites in the Andes may reveal additional regional variants in ant-Attamyces coevolution. Studies of such populations are most likely to inform models of coextinctions of obligate mutualistic partners that are doubly stressed by habitat marginality and by environmental change.",

    "abstract": "California red scale is suppressed to very low densities by the parasitoid Aphytis melinus. The system also appears stable. We report on an experimental test of the hypothesis that stability is caused by a refuge for scale. In a grapefruit grove in southern California in 1984-1985, the bark in the interior part of the tree provided a partial refuge from parasitism. Scale were approximately 100 times denser there than in the exterior of trees. In a field experiment, we removed Argentine ants from some blocks of trees to test whether (1) ants caused the refuge by interfering with Aphytis and (2) the expected reduction in scale density in the refuge would lead to an unstable interaction in the exterior. We also tested for density dependent parasitism, host mutilation, and predation by analyzing data from samples and from scale placed in the field. The temporal variability of the scale was at the low end of the range recorded in field populations. The experiment provided some evidence in support of the refuge hypothesis. The population in the refuge fluctuated much less than that in the exterior. Ant exclusion led to increased parasitism and lower scale density in the interior, and to increased fluctuations in abundance in the refuge and exterior. However, these changes were relatively small and perhaps temporary, suggesting that ants are not the main cause of the refuge and that we did not reduce the refuge density enough to determine whether the system would go unstable in the absence of the refuge population. Parasitism, host mutilation, and predation rates on scale showed no temporal density dependence, either direct or delayed, though detection of such patterns is difficult. Possible alternative. stabilizing mechanisms include size-dependent interactions between red scale and Aphytis.",

Unchecked spread of the Argentine ant on other islands in this archipelago, however, poses a grave threat to native ants, which include a number of endemic taxa.]",

Mortality in the dropped fruit was attributed to predation by two native ant species, the fire ant Solenopsis aurea Wheeler, and the California harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex californicus (Buckley), in concert with extreme summer ground temperatures. Dates that fell in the full sunlight rapidly increased in temperature, which resulted in larvae either exiting the fruit (exposing them to ants) or dying in the fruit.

    "abstract": "Argentine ants, Linepithema humile (Mayr), have a positive effect on populations of mealybugs (Pseudococcus spp.) in California vineyards. Previous studies have shown reductions in both ant activity and mealybug numbers after liquid ant baits were deployed in vineyards at densities of 85-620 bait stations/ha. However, bait station densities may need to be <85 bait stations/ha before bait-based strategies for ant control are economically comparable to spray-based insecticide treatments--a condition that, if met, will encourage the commercial adoption of liquid baits for ant control. This research assessed the effectiveness of baits deployed at lower densities. Two field experiments were conducted in commercial vineyards. In experiment 1, baits were deployed at 54-225 bait stations/ha in 2005 and 2006. In experiment 2, baits were deployed at 34-205 bait stations/ha in 2006 only. In both experiments, ant activity and the density of mealybugs in grape fruit clusters at harvest time declined with increasing bait station density. In 2005 only, European fruit lecanium scale [Parthenolecanium corni (BouchÈ)] were also present in fruit clusters, and scale densities were negatively related to bait station density. The results indicate that the amount of ant and mealybug control achieved by an incremental increase in the number of bait stations per hectare is constant across a broad range of bait station densities. The results are discussed in the context of commercializing liquid ant baits to provide a more sustainable Argentine ant control strategy.",

Both species tend hemipteran scales for food, & previous research suggests that these species' coexistence may depend on seasonal partitioning: winter ants are active primarily in the colder winter months, while Argentine ants are active primarily in the warmer months in northern California.  We investigated the physiological basis of seasonal partitioning in Argentine & winter ants by measuring critical thermal limits, & comparing how ant walking speed varies with temperature.  While both species had similar CTmax values, we found differences between the 2 species' critical thermal minima that may allow winter ants to remain functional at ecologically relevant temperatures between 0 & 2.5 degreesC.  We also found that winter ants' walking speeds are significantly less temperature-dependent, than those of Argentine ants.  Winter ants walk faster than Argentine ants at low temperatures, which may allow the winter ants to remain active & forage at lower winter temperatures.]",

    "abstract": "In this bulletin the life-history of the Argentine Ant is given at length.  Details are given of its invasion of New Orleans and the neighborhood more than 20 years ago, and there seems to be every reason for supposing that it was introduced into the city by means of the coffee ships from Brazilian ports.  The senior author noticed colonies of this ant in the woodwork of the steamer which carried him from New Orleans to New York in July 1911 and another species, Prenolepis longicornis, was found in great numbers on board a fruit steamer from Guatemala in January 1912.  The distribution of the ant in California is discussed in detail, with a map, and also its general distribution in the United States, the largest unbroken area being around New Orleans, with one or two isolated counties in the neighboring states.  The authors say that the distribution has a clear connection with the railroads, and that the only places remote from railroads where the pest has been discovered are on the banks of the Mississippi River below infested locations.  They account for this by supposing that the ants have been carried on driftwood which has stranded and so established new foci.  The distribution apparently is not affected by extreme variations in annual rainfall nor of mean surface temperature.  The Argentine ants have attracted most attention as a household pest, invading houses in wet weather and requiring the most strenuous efforts to keep them from food of all kinds.  They chiefly attack sweet articles, but also meat of all kinds and, occasionally, corn meal and wheat flour.  In badly infested locations, it is often necessary to place the bed-posts on sheets of glass coated with vaseline or some other repellant in order that the occupant may sleep in peace.  They are very serious pests in shops dealing in food stuffs of all kinds, and also in nurseries and on ornamental plants, as by protecting the scale-insects and plant lice they cause very serions damage.  They also seriously attack orange flowers in the groves, and in market gardens they have a habit of removing certain seeds before they have sprouted, lettuce seed being particularly subject to attack.  In the sugar-cane fields, in their search for the excretions of Pseudococcus calceolarias, the ants are a great nuisance.  They build coverings and shelters for the scales to protect them from storms and enemies and attend to them constantly, with the result that the Mealy Bug thrives to an extent which is impossible where the ants are not present.  In corn fields the aphids are far more numerous and much more generally distributed where the ant is present.  The latter also attends plant aphids on cotton, and it has been noticed in certain fields of cotton that the aphids, were abundant throughout the entire summer and autumn, whereas during these portions of the year they are normally almost absent.  The damage done by these ants in the orange groves of southern Louisiana is particularly serious.  Fig crops are also greatly damaged, the ripening figs being bored and the interior eaten.  Bee-keeping on any considerable scale is invariably abandoned when once the ants become numerous, so greatly do they interfere with the bees.  In poultry yards they attack the nests of sitting hens and a broken egg will attract such numbers that the fowls abandon their nests, while young chicks are frequently killed by the incessant worry.  Pyrethrum powder is found to be practically useless. The only substance which the authors say will protect sitting hens is \"zenoleum\" powder.  Indirect injury is due to the antagonism between the Argentine ant and certain native species; thus the fire ant. Solenopsis geminata, which is useful, in that it destroys a considerable number of Boll Weevils, is exterminated and its place taken by the far more troublesome Argentine ant.  Father Biever states that they have in many cases completely exterminated the bed-bugs in the hovels and tenements occupied by poor people in the city of New Orleans.  The authors then proceed to describe the insect at length, full details being given as to the methods of study adopted and a lengthy account of the life-history of the insect in all its stages.  The nests may be found almost anywhere, provided that light and water are sufficiently excluded.  The ants seldom burrow to any great depth in the ground and when they make burrows these are generally at the foot of tree-trunks or under the ridges in cane, cotton or corn fields, from 4 inches to 10 inches below the surface being the usual depth.  These ants have a strong dislike to light; their sense of smell is exceedingly keen, but it is doubtful whether they possess the sense of sight or hearing, at all events to any considerable extent.  Foraging ants have been found to travel about 145 feet per hour.  The authors discuss the relations of the ant to other insects at length and give a list of scale-insects and aphids attended by the ants, with the trees on which they are found, and they say that these Homoptera are so thoroughly protected that it is very rarely that a ladybird is found at all on the infested tree.  In one respect the ant is beneficial, in that it eats the sorghum midge Contarinia (Diplosis) sorghicola, Coq. O bservations on the natural control of this ant have shown that a cockroach (Thyrsocera cincta, Burm.), which occurs in the southern United States, Mexico and Central America, eats it, but the number of ants destroyed by this insect is certainly inappreciable.  Attempts were made to infest a nest with Pediculoides ventricosus [Pyemotes ventricosus], Newp., and the authors reared enormous colonies of these mites on larvae and then placed them in the formicaries, but found that although the mite had some effect, nothing approaching the quantity used was ever likely to occur in nature and the method was therefore useless.  Attempts to infect colonies with the fungus, Sporotrichum globuliferum, yielded no practical results.  The authors then go on to consider artificial methods of control and repression.  Winter trap boxes were also found to be very satisfactory. The bulletin concludes with a lengthy bibliography dating from 1868.    (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)",

In F. planipilis, the number of larger workers increased in proportional representation to distance from the nest.  Larger workers also weighed relatively less with distance from the nest, indicating that energy or water allocated for maintaining all foragers is patterned such that resource loss with forager mortality is minimized.  However, the smallest size class involved in foraging shows the opposite pattern, with heavier individuals being found farther from the nest.  Thus, it is possible that smaller size classes function as mobile reserves of energy or water to maintain foraging activity of larger classes at a distance from the colony.  In P. salinus all sizes of workers were equally likely to be found at any distance.  Foragers weighed significantly less than mound workers of the same head size, again suggesting resource conservation in provisioning foraging workers.]",

The sampling behavior of nests towards the initial patches and the new patch suggested that the nests were using a sampling rule based on maximizing net benefits of finding food minus the cost of sampling. The behavior of the nests towards the new patch was also significantly affected by what the foraging workers had previously encountered in the foraging patches. The behavior of the L. humile colonies is similar in pattern to what would result by Bayesian updating of expectations for success in novel foraging opportunities. These data are the first suggestions of such an ability in an insect.",

Using paired control and treatment branches from which we excluded ants and other non-volant predators, we found that effects of Argentine ants on the herbivore community were generally similar to those of P. imparis. Argentine ants and P. imparis suppressed the damage by skeletonising insects by 50%, but had little effect on most other external-feeding or internal-feeding guilds. 3. The abundance of aphids was 100% greater in the presence of Argentine ants, but there was no effect on aphid numbers in the presence of P. imparis. Late season aphid numbers were substantially higher in the presence of Argentine ants, but not P. imparis. 4. The effects of Argentine ants on skeletonising insects and aphids combined with the overwhelming abundance of Argentine ant workers, suggests that they may have substantial, but often overlooked, effects on the herbivore communities on other plant species in or near riparian habitats in which they invade.",

The relationship between leaf development, foliar nectar production, & ant visitation indicates that nectar secretion & ant maintenance are greatest following rapid leaf expansion.  Nectar measurements in the glasshouse corroborate field measurements showing that nectar production on a sapling is continuous through time & correlated with distribution & abundance of ants within a sapling.  The presence of 2 nectary types, leaf vein, & petiolar, on the leaves of O. pyramidale results in the continual maintenance of ants on the leaf undersurface.  Nectar production of a sapling increases with increasing leaf area resulting in greater number of ants per sapling.  Energetic costs of nectar production & ant maintenance appear low, representing about 1% of the total energy invested in leaves.  Spatial & diurnal patterns of ant activity changed very little over the study period.  Removal & exclusion of ants from saplings results in the utilization of foliar nectar by trigonid bees.  A significant difference in leaf damage between ant-visited & unvisited saplings, coupled with ant behavioral characteristics, is consistent with the hypothesis that ants act as antiherbivore agents on Ochroma.

D. discolor seed without food bodies are not attractive to ants and remain beneath the parent canopy. At Nude Wash, California, USA, diaspore removal distances are generally small, averaging 2.3 m away from the nearest D. discolor canopy in March-May 1977. Two lines of evidence indicate that this limited transport has a large effect on seed detection and utilization by rodents: (1) seeds placed in ant-proof dishes beneath the D. discolor canopy were about 10 times more likely to be removed by nocturnally foraging rodents than seeds placed in locations similar to those where ants locate their nests; (2) using D. discolor as bait, significantly more rodents were trapped beneath the plant canopy than in open areas where seeds were transported by ants. Manipulation of the density of D. discolor seed in these tests suggests that seed utilization by rodents is distance-responsive to the parent canopy rather than dependent on the density of seeds. Disapore analyses indicate that investment in the transport system is relatively small and represents <5% of the total investment in seeds.",

It is also considered a public health pest due to its painful stings. While it can be efficiently controlled by commercially available fire ant baits formulated with a corn-grit carrier, rain or irrigation is thought to degrade the carrier, compromising bait effectiveness. This study assessed the effect of irrigation on the efficacy of water-resistant and standard fire ant bait formulations, by comparing worker number, brood volume, and queen survivorship after access to water-soaked baits and to irrigated, bait-treated sod. In initial testing, wetted water-resistant and standard baits reduced fire ant colonies less than dry baits, both when baits were given to colonies directly and when colonies were given access to baits broadcasted (i.e., scattered) atop sod. Comparisons of the efficacy of piled versus broadcast applications of water-resistant and standard baits revealed reductions of >88% in adults and brood and no surviving queens for all bait treatments. This result was unexpected because piled baits were hypothesized to be better protected from irrigation than broadcast bait applications. In a field study, irrigated water-resistant and standard baits caused similar and significantly higher reductions in fire ant foraging activity relative to an untreated control. These results indicated that both the water-resistant and standard fire ant bait provided significant fire ant reductions even after irrigation.

    "abstract": "Brachymyrmex is a neglected genus of Formicinae because of its small body size, soft mesosoma, and superficially monotonous external morphology. These features have complicated the documentation of morphological variation, resulting in poorly defined and incompletely described species. Consequently, the taxonomy of the genus is complex and problematic, which has impeded research and conservation efforts. Here, we integrate molecular and morphological data to recognize species boundaries in Brachymyrmex and to guide its long-overdue revision. Specifically, we (1) redefine the limits of all described species, subspecies, and varieties based on intra- and interspecific morphological variation in workers; (2) document this variation quantitatively by constructing morphospace occupation and statistically analyzing measurements; (3) synthesize our findings on diagnostic traits in a dichotomous, illustrated identification key; and (4) examine the significance of our morphological identification system with molecular evidence from four gene fragments (EF1aEF1, EF1aEF2, WG, and COI). We recognize 40 species, of which four are new to science: Brachymyrmex bahamensis, Brachymyrmex bicolor, Brachymyrmex iridescens, and Brachymyrmex sosai. Furthermore, Brachymyrmex attenuatus and Brachymyrmex bonariensis are raised to species, and we propose 25 new synonyms. Morphometrics indicated that even poorly distinguishable species pairs show statistically significant differences in some traits, and that taxonomically problematic cases relate to taxa that demonstrate large intraspecific trait variance. Our molecular analysis supports the monophyly of the genus based on increased taxon sampling, and of the 19 species that were included 18 were retrieved as monophyletic. The single case of incongruence was also flagged in morphological analyses and requires extended geographic sampling before it can be resolved. In conclusion, the molecular work corroborates the morphologically recognized species boundaries. We also document the presence of worker dimorphism and putative worker-queen intercastes in several Brachymyrmex species, which indicates that the genus may present a promising study system to understand caste evolution in ants.          *[ Louisiana misspelled Lousiana; Vanuatu misspelled Vanatu.]",

We found that colonies founded by multiple, unrelated queens experienced significant survival & growth advantages that outlasted the colony founding period.  Multi-queen colonies experienced lower mortality than single-queen colonies, & queens in groups experienced lower mortality than solitary queens.  Further, multi-queen colonies produced workers at a faster rate than did single-queen colonies, even while experiencing lower per-queen worker production costs.  Additionally, we characterized ontogenetic changes in the organization of labor, & observed increasing & decreasing task performance diversity by workers & queens, respectively, as colonies grew.  This dynamic task allocation likely reflects a response to the changing role of queens as they are increasingly able to delegate risky & costly tasks to an expanding workforce.

Larger-bodied workers survived longer in desiccation assays, emphasizing the importance of reduced surface area-to-volume ratios in maintaining water balance.

    "abstract": "The California seed harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus exhibits striking differences in queen behavior and colony organization throughout its range. Most populations show the likely ancestral condition of single-queen colonies (monogyny). However, in one known population, cooperation between queens during colony founding (pleometrosis) occurs, and is suspected to persist to the mature colony stage (primary polygyny). To better understand this variation in social phenotype, we estimate relatedness among co-foundresses, measure the frequency of polygyny in adult colonies across three focal populations, and assess population genetic structure between populations. We additionally measure queen mating frequency (polyandry) across focal populations. With few possible exceptions, queens within pleometrotic associations are unrelated. We demonstrate a correlation between pleometrosis in incipient colonies and polygyny in adult colonies at the population level. Nuclear microsatellites and mtDNA barcoding indicate significant structure between focal populations. Queens from all three focal populations engage in relatively high levels of polyandry. These findings, when examined with previous data demonstrating that pleometrosis leads to polygynous colonies in the laboratory, strongly suggest that the same occurs in nature. However, the possibility of additional queen adoption in adult colonies (secondary polygyny) is not excluded. Thus, polygynous P. californicus colonies potentially represent long-term associations of unrelated family groups, containing multiple unrelated queens and their mixed-paternity offspring. Due to its pronounced variation in social behavior, P. californicus provides a unique opportunity to examine the evolutionary history and genetic underpinnings of cooperation among non-relatives, a strategy of intense interest in behavioral ecology.",

    "abstract": "Research on the evolution of cooperative groups tends to explore the costs and benefits of cooperation, with less focus on the proximate behavioral changes necessary for the transition from solitary to cooperative living. However, understanding what proximate changes must occur, as well as those pre-conditions already in place, is critical to understanding the origins and evolution of sociality. The California harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus demonstrates population-level variation in colony founding over a close geographic range. In adjacent populations, queens either found nests as single individuals (haplometrosis) or form cooperative groups of nonrelatives (pleometrosis). We compared aggregation, aggression, and tolerance of queens from one pleometrotic and two haplometrotic populations during nest initiation, to determine which behaviors show an evolutionary shift and which are present at the transition to pleometrosis. Surprisingly, within-nest aggregative behavior was equally present among all populations. In nesting boxes with multiple available brood-rearing sites, both queen types readily formed and clustered around a single common brood pile, suggesting that innate attraction to brood (offspring) facilitates the transition to social aggregation. In contrast, queens from the three populations differed in their probabilities of attraction on the ground to nest sites occupied by other queens and in levels of aggression. Our results suggest that some key behavioral mechanisms facilitating cooperation in P. californicus are in place prior to the evolution of pleometrosis and that the switch from aggression to tolerance is critical for the evolution of stable cooperative associations.",

Field studies were conducted at an island-fox, Urocyon littoralis littoralis, breeding facility located on San Miguel Island, California Channel Islands National Park, USA, where 40% of captive foxes were infected with adult Mesocestoides.   8% of deer-mice at the fox pen site were infected with Mesocestoides metacestodes while none were infected at a distant campground site where foxes were absent, thereby indicating the potential localized presence of a first intermediate host.   To test whether ants from San Miguel Island contained Mesocestoides DNA, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic assay was developed using nested primers that could detect a single hexacanth larva within pooled samples of 10-ants.   Lasius niger & Tapinoma sessile collected near the fox breeding-facility were tested using the nested-PCR assay.   Seven of 223 (3.1%) pooled samples of L. niger and 2 of 84 (2.4%) pooled samples of T. sessile tested positive for Mesocestoides DNA, while none of the ants were positive at the campground site.   Positive samples were sequenced & found to match DNA sequences from Mesocestoides obtained from island-fox & deer-mice.   Finally, to determine whether ants function as a first intermediate host for Mesocestoides, colony-raised deer-mice were fed L. niger or T. sessile collected from the San Miguel Island fox breeding-facility.   No mouse became infected with Mesocestoides metacestodes after ingesting ants.   While both L. niger & T. sessile from SMI were positive for Mesocestoides DNA, they were not infective to deer-mice in the laboratory.]",

Specifically, we found a negative relationship between exploratory behavior & the expression of the foraging gene (Lhfor).  Then we determine how colonies allocate exploratory individuals in natural conditions.  We found that ants from inside the nest are the least exploratory individuals, whereas workers on newly formed foraging trails are the most exploratory individuals.  We also found temporal differences throughout the year.  In early-mid spring, when new resources emerge, workers are more exploratory than at the end of winter, potentially allowing the colony to find & exploit new resources.]",

    "abstract": "The seeds of many plant species produce mucilage on their surfaces that when wetted and dried, firmly adheres seeds to surfaces and substrates. Previous studies have demonstrated that seed anchorage to the ground can reduce seed predation, although only a few species have thus far been tested. Here we investigated whether binding to the ground reduces seed removal by harvester ants Pogonomyrmex subdentatus, an important granivore, for 53 species with mucilaginous seeds. We also explored functional traits that associate with seed removal risk to understand the ecological and evolutionary context of this granivory resistance trait. Using a field cafeteria choice experiment, we compared harvester ant seed removal of wetted ground\u0010bound seeds to dry unbound control seeds for these 53 species. We developed a simple assay to score dislodgement force. We examined whether this force, seed mass and seed mucilage production explained the interspecific variation in protection that we observed in field seed removal. We integrated these experiments with a broad scale test of correlates of seed attachment using a previously published dataset of attachment potential of mucilaginous seeds for 432 species, examining correlations of attachment potential with 13 plant traits and the climate characteristics of the species' range. Binding to the ground reduced seed removal in 42 of 53 species tested. The benefit increased with seed dislodgement force, which itself increased with mucilage production, but not with seed mass. In the larger dataset, shorter plant life span, higher temperature, more solar radiation, higher humidity, fewer wet days per year and higher seed density correlated positively with the odds of seed attachment. We also found that attachment potential showed a concave down quadratic relationship with latitude, peaking at roughly 30∞. No strong evidence that any of the other six predictors correlated with attachment potential was found. We demonstrate that protection from granivores is a widespread convergent function of seed mucilage and is associated with mucilage production. We highlight the need for increased mechanistic investigations into this common but poorly studied trait, particularly in relation to functional drivers of the broad patterns we found.

The distribution of their initial spread was investigated here from April to July 2020. In the invasion area, numerous nests and individuals were identified, indicating that they had settled and successfully invaded the habitat. To track the invasion of the Argentine ants we conducted haplotype analysis using COI, COII, and Cytb sequences of their mitochondrial DNA. The invasive ants had the same mitochondrial haplotype (H3) as Argentine ants from America (Chile, Ecuador, Bermuda) and East Asia (Japan). When comparing the import trade volumes at Busan port with the Argentine ant haplotypes from other countries, it was determined that the invasive ants may have originated from the United States or Japan. Numerous ecological and economic impacts due to their invasion and spread in other countries has previously been reported. Therefore, prompt control measures for the Argentine ants found at Busan port, at this relatively early stage of settlement, is required.",

In addition, the host populations unexpectedly were found to be polyphyletic. Populations of Pogonomyrmex rugosus from an area east of the Chiricahua Mountains in Southern Arizona belong to a mitochondrial clade separate from the more western clade of P. rugosus from the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Evidence of mitochondrial DNA introgression between P. rugosus and P. barbatus was also observed.

We test this basic assumption by conducting a detailed genetic analysis of 4 native & 6 introduced populations with 5 to 15 microsatellite loci & one mitochondrial gene.  In contrast to the assumption that native populations consist of family-based colonies with related individuals who are aggressive toward members of other colonies, we found that native populations also form supercolonies, and are effectively unicolonial.  Moreover, just as in introduced populations, the relatedness between nestmates is not distinguishable from zero in these native range supercolonies.  Genetic differentiation between native supercolonies was very high for both nuclear & mitochondrial markers, indicating extremely limited gene flow between supercolonies.  The only important difference between the native & introduced populations was that supercolonies were several orders of magnitude smaller in the native range (25-500 m).  This size difference has important consequences for our understanding of the evolution & stability of unicolonial structures, because the relatively small size of supercolonies in the native range implies that competition can occur between supercolonies, which can act as a break on the spread of selfish mutants by eliminating supercolonies harboring them.]",

Ants were ascending to the canopies from April until November.  Temperature & colony nutritional requirements shaped their seasonal foraging patterns.  The daily activity pattern of P. schmitzii was strictly diurnal whereas L. grandis & P. pallidula were active during the 24 hours of the day.  Citrus nectar & predation/scavenging did not represent important food sources.  On the contrary, hemipteran honeydew was the principal food source for the ants on the canopies.  More than 60% of the total honeydew sources, & 100% of the citrus mealybug Planococcus citri (Risso) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) colonies, were tended by ants during spring & summer.  Ant-exclusion from the citrus canopies resulted in significantly lower scale densities on fruits at harvest, when compared with the control treatment where ants had access to the canopies.  Scale density on the fruits was positively correlated with the number of ants that climbed to the citrus canopy.  This result suggests that the increase of A. aurantii densities induced by Mediterranean ants depends on the intensity of the ant-activity.]",

California red scale densities in the ant-excluded treatment began to be significantly lower than in the ant-allowed control in May (1 mo after ant activity began), and this difference increased until November. Thus, the effect of the ants on California red scale density seems to be accumulative. At harvest, scale densities on fruits were significantly lower in the ant-excluded treatment.

Extrafloral nectar feeding by coccinellids occurred throughout the world in diverse natural and man-made habitats. Since ladybird beetles are, at times, common and occasionally abundant visitors to extrafloral nectaries, they could reduce insect herbivores of the plants that bear the glands, much as do many extrafloral nectar feeding ants. Most extrafloral nectary feeding by ladybird beetles, however, was not observed in the presence of prey, nor usually where ants were abundant. Ladybird beetles were less frequent and less constant visitors to extrafloral nectaries than were ants, and appear by contrast to be poor mutualists to extrafloral nectary-bearing plants. Extrafloral nectar seems to be an important energy source for coccinellids in the absence of prey. It probably enhances ladybird beetle survival and may maintain them in the habitat, to feed on insect herbivores as they appear.

Temperature\u0010dependent effects on predator-prey interactions are a major mechanism through which these effects occur. To understand the net effects of predator attack rates and dynamic windows of prey vulnerability, we examined the impacts of temperature on the interaction of a caterpillar (Arctia virginalis) and its ant predator (Formica lasioides). We conducted field experiments to examine attack rates on caterpillars relative to temperature, ant abundance, and body size, and laboratory experiments to determine the effects of temperature on caterpillar growth. We modeled temperature\u0010dependent survival based on the integrated effects of temperature\u0010dependent growth and temperature\u0010 and size\u0010dependent predation. Attack rates on caterpillars increased with warming and ant recruitment, but decreased with caterpillar size. Caterpillar growth rates increased with temperature, narrowing the window of vulnerability. The model predicted that net caterpillar survival would decrease with temperature, suggesting that A. virginalis populations could be depressed with future climate warming. Theoretical work suggests that the net outcome of predator-prey interactions with increasing temperature depends on the respective responses of interacting species in terms of velocity across space, whereas the present study suggests the importance of effects of temperature on prey window of vulnerability, or 'velocity' across time.",

In particular, we examine the role of ants in seed dispersal, soil enhancement, scavenging of urban food waste, & pest control.  We also examine how urbanization affects trophic interactions involving ants, including mutualistic interactions with hemipterans, & how this affects the ecosystem service of pest control in cities.  We found that the potential for ants to provide ecosystem services in urban areas depends on how the ant community is affected by urbanization & the resulting species composition.  In some cases, the remaining species are highly effective, but in other cases, the most efficient species decline or are replaced by less efficient species as urbanization proceeds.  Because these services depend on the structure of ant communities, which, in turn, is predicted to be altered by climate change, we also examine the effect of climate change on ant communities in the urban environment, including interactions between urbanization & climate change.

Point counts and tracking stations were used to identify potential predators and video photography to document actual nest predators. Parental behavior at depredated nests was compared to that at successful nests to determine whether activity (frequency of trips to and from the nest) and singing vs. non-singing on the nest affected nest predation. Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens) were the most abundant potential avian predator, followed by Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica). Coyotes (Canis latrans) were abundant, with smaller mammalian predators occurring in low abundance. Cameras documented a 48% predation rate with scrub-jays as the major nest predators (67%), but Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana, 17%), gopher snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus, 8%) and Argentine ants (Linepithema humile, 8%) were also confirmed predators. Identification of potential predators from tracking stations and point counts demonstrated only moderate correspondence with actual nest predators.

    "abstract": "Competition-defence trade\u0010offs have long been thought to promote plant coexistence and increase species diversity. However, insights from modern coexistence theory clarify that such trade\u0010offs alone cannot sustain coexistence. Coexistence also requires stabilising niche differences and the ability of competitor populations to persist under consumer pressure. Despite the breadth of potential consequences of competition-defence trade\u0010offs, we have little mechanistic understanding of how they affect diversity in natural communities. We investigated the effects of seed harvesting by ants on coexistence in an annual plant community. We parameterised a model of plant competitive population dynamics with data from two field experiments: (a) plant demographic rates and competition coefficients determined by growing plants alone and against intra\u0010 and interspecific competitor density gradients; (b) plant fitness losses to ant consumers determined by measuring seed removal from experimental depots. We tested for a trade\u0010off between a plant species\u0019 demographic potential and its susceptibility to consumption and then determined the bounds of ant effects on pairwise and multispecies coexistence by comparing model projections with and without seed consumption. Ants harvested seeds of all plant species, but they strongly preferred the competitively superior large seeded species, inducing a competition-defence trade\u0010off. Unequal seed loss to ants changed competition\u0010based fitness hierarchies, affecting both the number and identities of plant species pairs that were predicted to coexist compared to a scenario without ants. The trade\u0010off most often prevented coexistence by severely disadvantaging the superior competitor or excluding species directly through overconsumption, and a simulated reduction in the overall consumption rate opened few additional opportunities for coexistence. Ant exacerbation of average fitness differences was particularly disruptive to multispecies coexistence, where niche differences were insufficient to stabilise the coexistence of plant triplets and quadruplets. Synthesis. Our results show that the presence of a competition\u0013defence trade\u0010off in a community with stabilising niche differences does not always increase diversity. Instead, the full range of diversity outcomes - positive and negative changes in species number and changes in the identity of the dominant - are possible. Taken together, our results support the emerging paradigm that consumers have wide\u0010ranging impacts on plant diversity and suggest that variation in consumer pressure may be an important driver of large\u0010scale diversity patterns.",

Intraspecific and intraguild communication have received a lot of attention, especially among bee taxa. However, little is known about interspecific chemical communication in general and in non-bees in particular. Ants, such as Formica francoeuri, also are opportunistic floral visitors who seek the carbohydrate-rich rewards of flowers. Thus, these ants likely encounter aggressive competitors for nectar, such as bees. Here, we performed a series of experiments to examine how ant foragers respond to bee pheromones, venom and sting glands in the context of foraging. Understanding how ants utilize non-target chemical cues will identify previously cryptic interactions and provide new insights into the hidden mechanisms governing foraging decisions. As the foraging decisions by floral visitors have a direct impact on the pollination mutualism, studies such as this will help us build better predictive models of plant\u0013pollinator networks and develop hypotheses as to how these interaction networks may change with shifts in the floral visitor community.",

Within urban agroecosystems, where non-native plants are abundant, native plants may boost the abundance and richness of beneficial arthropods. Nevertheless, current information focuses on pollinators, with little attention being paid to other beneficials, like natural enemies. (2) We examined how the species richness of native plants, garden management, and landscape composition influence the abundance and species richness of all, native, and non-native bees, ladybeetles, ants, and ground-foraging spiders in urban agroecosystems (i.e., urban community gardens) in California. (3) We found that native plants (~10% of species, but only ~2.5% of plant cover) had little influence on arthropods, with negative effects only on non-native spider richness, likely due to the low plant cover provided by native plants. Garden size boosted native and non-native bee abundance and richness and non-native spider richness; floral abundance boosted non-native spider abundance and native and non-native spider richness; and mulch cover and tree and shrub abundance boosted non-native spider richness. Natural habitat cover promoted non-native bee and native ant abundance, but fewer native ladybeetle species were observed. (4) While native plant richness may not strongly influence the abundance and richness of beneficial arthropods, other garden management features could be manipulated to promote the conservation of native organisms or ecosystem services provided by native and non-native organisms within urban agroecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The role of generalist predators has long been considered an important component of mortality for many agricultural pests but can be difficult to quantify. We present the use of digital imaging as a means of both identifying key stink bug egg predators and measuring their relative impact on egg survivorship. Brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys and bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris, two exotic stink bugs new to California, are now widely distributed throughout the state. A survey was conducted to identify resident natural enemies of their eggs. A field camera aided in the identification of arthropods attacking these eggs and their relative impact. Predation of BMSB eggs, which are naturally oviposited onto plant foliage, was less than for eggs of bagrada bug, which oviposit onto and into soil. The top ranked predators of BMSB eggs were the carabid Laemostenus complanatus (Coleoptera) the European earwig Forficula auricularia and ring-legged earwig Euborellia annulipes (Dermaptera), the oriental cockroach Blatta orientalis (Orthoptera), and the spider Trachelas spp. (Araneae). The two most common and important predators of bagrada bug were two ant species (Formicidae), Solenopsis xyloni and Monomorium ergatogyna, and species of Collembola (Entomobryidae). A Predation Index was developed to compare the relative importance of BMSB egg predators. Lastly, two striking, unanticipated results are reported: an apparent synergistic interaction between the spider Trachelas spp. and native ant M. ergatogyna in causing damage to sentinel eggs of BMSB, and the predaceous role for Collembola on bagrada bug sentinel eggs.  This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time and is therefore in the public domain.",

An ancient supergene in the ant genus Formica presents an unusual opportunity to compare supergene\u0010associated phenotypes and the factors that influence the persistence of polymorphism in different species. We investigate the genetic architecture of social organization in Formica francoeuri, an ant species native to low\u0010 and mid\u0010elevation semiarid regions of southern California, and describe an efficient technique for estimating mode of social organization using population genomic data. Using this technique, we show that F. francoeuri exhibits polymorphism in colony social organization and that the phenotypic polymorphism is strongly associated with genotypes within the Formica social supergene region. The distribution of supergene haplotypes in F. francoeuri differs from that of related species Formica selysi in that colonies with multiple queens contain almost exclusively workers that are heterozygous for alternative supergene haplotypes. Moreover, heterozygous workers exhibit allele\u0010specific expression of the polygyne\u0010associated haplotype at the candidate gene Knockout, which is thought to influence social organization. We also report geographic population structure and variation in worker size across a large fraction of the species range. Our results suggest that, although the Formica supergene is conserved within the genus, the mechanisms that maintain the supergene and its associated polymorphisms differ among species.",

Here, I review the known ecology of nectar\u0010secreting galls and speculate on their wider ecological significance based on past research and similar ecological systems.

Finally, I lay out some of the future directions for research into nectar\u0010secreting galls and their species interactions, including important questions that remain to be addressed. Future studies of the diversity and ecology of nectar\u0010secreting galls are necessary to determine the extent to which they may be involved in ecological functioning and the evolution of ant\u0010mutualisms, and it is hoped that this review will contribute to motivating and developing future research.",

    "abstract": "An overriding management goal for national parks is the maintenance or, where necessary, the restoration of natural ecological processes. In Sequoia-Kings Canyon and Yosemite National Parks, there is concern about the effects of fire suppression on the giant sequoia-mixed conifer forest ecosystem. The National Park Service is currently using prescribed fire management and prescribed burning as tools to reintroduce fire as a natural process. However, there are questions about the positive and negative effects of reintroducing fire in the giant sequoia-mixed conifer ecosystem. Reintroducing fire in the Sierra Nevada forests needs critical evaluation with respect to the pathogens that affect giant sequoias. We designed a 3-year study, funded by the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, to: (1) determine the effects of fire scars and their re-burning on the incidence, extent, and survival of fungi in giant sequoia; (2) identify pathogens, insects, location of decay, and other characteristics present in standing old-growth giant sequoia fire scars; (3) evaluate host specialization and cross infectivity of isolates of Heterobasidion annosum from white fir (Abies concolor), red fir (Abies manifica), and giant sequoia (Sequoia gigantea); and (4) develop criteria and recommendations for monitoring the effects of fire on pathogens in giant sequoia stands. The total circumference of giant sequoia trees affected by fire scars ranged from 3.3% to 69.5%. Cross-sectional area affected by fire scars ranged from 3.2% to 53.7%. The season of year in which prescribed burning takes place could influence the effect fire has on giant sequoia. A survey of 90 fire scars for the presence of resin, Mycocalicium, carpenter ants, other insects, Arachnids, decay above and below groundline, and bird activity (i.e., cavities) yielded a high presence of each factor when all bum groups were combined. Statistically significant differences in bird cavity activity, decay above groundline, and carpenter ant activity were noted among the unburned group, l-year burn group, and J-year burn group. The Pilodyn wood tester was effective in determining the presence of decay above and below groundline. A variety of microfungi were found associated with giant sequoia fire scars. The fungi most frequently isolated were: Byssochlamys filva from 34 out of 90 fire scars (38%). Acrodontium intermissum from 22 out of 90 fire scars (24%). and Tritirachium sp. from 14 out of 90 fire scars (16%). Several other microfungi and Basidiomycetes were also identified. H. annosum acts as both a saprophyte and a pathogen in the giant sequoia-mixed conifer ecosystem. The results of these experiments have demonstrated H. annosum can spread from true fir to giant sequoia and vice versa, given that they are of the same \"S\" intersterility group.

We investigate whether behavioral variation among colonies of the black harvester ant, Messor andrei, remains consistent across foraging and disturbance situations and ask whether consistent colony behavior is affected by nest site and weather. We examined variation among colonies in responsiveness to food baits and to disturbance, measured as a change in numbers of active ants, and in the speed with which colonies retrieved food and removed debris. Colonies differed consistently, across foraging and disturbance situations, in both responsiveness and speed. Increased activity in response to food was associated with a smaller decrease in response to alarm. Speed of retrieving food was correlated with speed of removing debris. In all colonies, speed was greater in dry conditions, reducing the amount of time ants spent outside the nest. While a colony occupied a certain nest site, its responsiveness was consistent in both foraging and disturbance situations, suggesting that nest structure influences colony personality.",

The amount of intraspecific variation occurring in the adult males and gynes was equivalent to that of workers, making the taxonomic information gained from these castes no better than information from the workers. A new species, S. metallica, is described from southern Brazil, based on adult workers, adult gynes, males, and worker larvae. The following classification changes are made: S. virulens is placed in the S. virulens species-group; S. tridens and S. substituta are placed in the S. tridens species-group; S. metallica new species, S. daguerrei, S. electra, S. hostilis, S. interrupta, S. invicta, S. macdonaghi, S. megergates, S. pusillignis, S. pythia, S. quinquecuspis, S. richteri, S. saevissima, and S. weyrauchi are placed in the S. saevissima species-group; and S. geminata, S. xyloni, S. amblychila, S. aurea, S. gayi, and S. bruesi are left in the S. geminata species-group. The older classification, which designated complexes and subcomplexes, is abandoned. For the S. saevissima species-group, adults of males and gynes, as well as worker larvae, are described and diagnosed for each species.

Messor pergandei workers showed weak trail following to 5 ppm trails of the pyrazines 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, whereas M. andrei workers showed no behavioral response.

Trophic relations are presented in a series of nested subwebs & delineations of the community.  Complexity arises from the large number of interactive species, the frequency of omnivory, age structure, looping, the lack of compartmentalization, & the complexity of the arthropod & soil faunas.  Web features found in the Coachella also characterize other communities & should produce equivalently complex webs.  If anything, diversity & complexity in most nondesert habitats are greater than those in deserts.  Patterns from the Coachella web are compared with theoretical predictions & \"empirical generalizations\" derived from catalogs of published webs.  The Coachella web differs greatly: chains are longer, omnivory, & loops are not rare, connectivity is greater (species interact with many more predators & prey), top predators are rare or nonexistent, & prey-to predator ratios are greater than 1.0.  The evidence argues that actual community food webs are extraordinarily more complex than those webs cataloged by theorists.

    "abstract": "Host specificity of the decapitating fly Pseudacteon curvatus was studied to determine if this species is suitable for release as a classical biocontrol agent of imported fire ants in the United States.  A series of no-choice tests with 19 species of ants from 12 genera showed that P. curvatus will not develop in ants outside the genus Solenopsis.  P. curvatus successfully parasitized the native fire ants Solenopsis geminata and Solenopsis xyloni in no-choice tests, but rates of parasitism were considerably less than those with the imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta (6% and 35% of the rate for S. invicta, respectively).  Paired preference tests showed that P. curvatus has a 3- to 4-fold preference for S. invicta over either of the native fire ants.  Furthermore, flies reared from native fire ants still strongly preferred imported fire ants.  P. curvatus was not attracted to vegetables, fruits, meat, prepared foods, carrion, or dung.  This study indicates that release of P. curvatus will pose only a small risk to native fire ants.  The argument is made that this risk needs to be balanced against potential benefits to numerous other native organisms and a high probability that release of this fly would actually benefit native fire ants because impacts on imported fire ants would almost certainly be much greater than those on native fire ants.

    "abstract": "The tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata (F.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), is an invasive pest throughout most of the tropics, especially on islands in the Pacific. Natural enemies such as the fire ant decapitating fly, Pseudacteon bifidus Brown and Morrison (Diptera: Phoridae), offer the potential for use as self-sustaining biological control agents provided they are host specific and do not cause other unintended problems. This paper provides details of sequential field and laboratory choice tests with host and non-host ants, as well as tests with a variety of potential food items to which adult flies may be attracted. Results of these tests showed that P. bifidus flies are highly host specific to tropical fire ants and that they are not attracted to ants in other genera. Even other species of fire ants are unlikely to be parasitized by this fly in the field. Furthermore, tests with a variety of food items demonstrated that P. bifidus is not likely to be a nuisance to humans because it is not attracted to carrion, feces, fruits, or various kinds of human food items. In short, P. bifidus would not likely cause unintended problems if it were used as a self-sustaining biological control agent of invasive tropical fire ants.

In order to better define the host range of Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3), we collected and exposed colonies of 2 native fire ants (Solenopsis aurea Wheeler, Solenopsis xyloni McCook) and 2 native thief ants (Solenopsis carolinensis Forel, Solenopsis molesta [Say]) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) to the SINV-3 virus. Despite extreme exposure to the virus, active, replicating infections resulted only in colonies of the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren). These results, combined with a previous study of ants from 13 other genera, strongly support the proposition that the SINV-3 virus can be used safely as either a biopesticide or a self-sustaining biocontrol agent in parts of California, the Caribbean, and other regions of the world where this virus does yet not occur.

    "note": "Part of FORMIS 17; from-DPW,",
    "abstract": "*[In chapter 1, I produced the first time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of Cephalotes.  I found that the origin of crown Cephalotes occurred during the Eocene, a time of global warming associated with the origin of many other neotropical clades.  The diversification dynamics of Cephalotes are consistent with diversity-dependence, with a leveling off in diversification rates since approximately 9 million years ago.  I found evidence for a rapid Pleistocene radiation in one clade associated with the Chacoan biogeographic region, South America.  Community phylogenetics analyses indicate that species in the Chacoan region are more phylogenetically clustered than communities in other regions.  Furthermore, using state-dependent speciation models, I found strong evidence for higher rates of speciation in the Chacoan region.  Recent invasion of a novel habitat appears to have facilitated renewed diversification in Cephalotes.  I investigated the distribution & phylogeographic history of Cephalotes atratus.  I used recently developed tools to simultaneously infer phylogeny, divergence times, & dispersal history, in concert with ecological niche modeling to discover abiotic factors influencing the distribution of C. atratus.  I reconstructed the most recent common ancestor of extant C. atratus populations at around 2.6 mya, at the beginning of the Pleistocene.  The center of origin of C. atratus was inferred to be located in the Amazon Basin, & colonization of the range edges occurred in the last few hundred thousand years.  Only one dispersal event was inferred into Panama, the northern edge of the geographic range, from South America.  Ecological niche modeling indicates that suitable habitat is present farther north, suggesting C. atratus is still in the process of expanding its range.  Alternatively, ecological interactions, such as competition with a closely related species, may be inhibiting expansion of the range.  Based on phylogeographic reconstruction, C. atratus was probably initially a rainforest-adapted species that may have invaded drier, less densely tree-covered environments as the result of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations.  Habitat fluctuations during the Pleistocene could have influenced the dispersal, isolation, & subsequent secondary contact of C. atratus lineages, leading to observed phylogeographic patterns.  C. atratus does not occur in the Chaco ecosystem.  Finally, I performed an analysis of the colony kin & population genetic structure of C. atratus to gain insight into its sociogenetic system.  I used microsatellite markers to genotype individuals from multiple colonies in 3 disjunct populations of C. atratus to examine intraspecific variation across the large geographic range of the species.  My study revealed several previously unknown characteristics of the reproductive strategy of C. atratus.  First, it is facultatively polygynous.  Second, queens are either singly mated or exhibit very low levels of polyandry.  Third, there are remarkable intraspecific differences in colony kin structure as a result of varying proportions of polygynous colonies in each population.  Additionally, my results support the idea that C. atratus is an independent colony founder.  Intraspecific differences in these reproductive traits are likely driven by the nesting biology of C. atratus & ecological variation across its geographic range.]",

The Formica supergene underlies variation in colony queen number in at least 5 species.  We expand previous analyses of sequence divergence on this chromosome to encompass about 90 species spanning the Formica phylogeny.  Within the nonrecombining region, the gene knockout contains 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are consistently differentiated between 2 alternative supergene haplotypes in divergent European Formica species, & we show that these same SNPs are present in most Formica clades.  In these clades, including an early diverging Nearctic Formica clade, individuals with alternative genotypes at knockout also have higher differentiation in other portions of this chromosome.  We identify hotspots of SNPs along this chromosome that are present in multiple Formica clades to detect genes that may have contributed to the emergence & maintenance of the genetic polymorphism.  Finally, we infer 3 gene duplications on one haplotype, based on apparent heterozygosity within these genes in the genomes of haploid males. This study strengthens the evidence that this supergene originated early in the evolution of Formica & that just a few loci in this large region of suppressed recombination retain strongly differentiated alleles across contemporary Formica lineages.]",

As intact ants tended to be active during testing, we performed a parallel set of experiments on individuals rendered motionless by decapitation. Both intact and decapitated ants exhibited discontinuous ventilation.  Decapitation caused metabolic rate (VCO2) and burst frequency to decrease in all three species. Burst volume either remained constant or increased after removal of the head, though mass-specific VCO2 was unaffected except in P. rugosus. Mass-specific VCO2S of headless harvesters were comparable with published values derived from motionless specimens of other ant species. The mean Q10 for intact ants of all three species was 2.37; for decapitated insects the mean was 2.32.

    "abstract": "Hummingbirds compete with other floral visitors for access to floral resources (nectar). Several hummingbird species, including Anna\u0019s (Calypte anna), Black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri), Allen\u0019s (Selasphorus sasin), and Costa\u0019s (Calypte costae) hummingbirds, make extensive use of non-native plants of urban areas of Southern California. Exploitation of urban ornamentals may expose hummingbirds to increased interactions with invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), which are also frequently found foraging on flowers in such habitats. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which hummingbirds interact with invasive ants at nectar resources in a series of aviary and wild experiments. When given a choice, hummingbirds avoided flowers and feeders with ants in or feeding at a sucrose solution. We identified specific ant-derived cues (visual, tactile, and gustatory) which are sufficient to elicit changes in bird foraging. Tactile and gustatory cues appeared to play the strongest role in mediating interactions with Argentine ants, with visual cues alone not enough to deter hummingbirds from feeding at sugar resources with ants. Our experiments provide support for interference competition at floral resources, where ants limit the birds\u0019 access to flowers and feeders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Hummingbirds and invasive Argentine ants both visit and exploit floral resources. However, hummingbirds avoid nectar sources that are occupied by ants. Here, we detail a series of mechanistic experiments to determine the proximate cause of this avoidance behavior. We found that the touch and taste of ants is strongly aversive to both wild, free-foraging and aviary hummingbirds.

Sampling over 2 years in burned & unburned Darlingtonia fens & their adjacent upland forests, we found that the effects of disturbance by fire depended on habitat type.  In forests, fire intensity predicted richness in ant assemblages in both years after the fire.  Plant community composition predicted richness 2 years after the fire.  No factors were associated with richness in the species-poor fen ant assemblages.  Species-specific responses to both habitat type & disturbance by fire were idiosyncratic.  Assemblage composition depended on habitat type, but not disturbance by fire.  The composition of each assemblage between years was more dissimilar in burned than unburned sites.  In total, we observed 125,280 ants representing 26 species in 14 genera across all sites in 2003 & 2004.  In 2003, 24 ant species in 12 genera were observed; 13 species were found in fens & 23 were found in forests.  In 2004, 22 species in 13 genera were observed; 12 & 19 species were found in fens & forests, respectively.  In both years, we found only one rare species, Leptothorax sp. A, only in fens.  The abundance of the 4 most common species, Tapinoma sessile, Aphaenogaster occidentalis, Camponotus vicinus, & Temnothorax nevadensis, responded idiosyncratically to fire history & habitat variables.  The abundance of Tapinoma sessile was greater in fen plots & in unburned plots than in burned plots for both fens and forests and in both years.

    "abstract": "Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria, which are very common in arthropods and nematodes. Wolbachia infection may affect host reproduction through feminization, parthenogenesis, male-killing, cytoplasmic incompatibility and increased fecundity. Previous studies showing discrepancies between the phylogenies of Wolbachia and its arthropod hosts indicate that infection is frequently lost, but the causes of symbiont extinction have so far remained elusive. Here, we report data showing that colonization of new habitats is a possible mechanism leading to the loss of infection. The presence and prevalence of Wolbachia were studied in three native and eight introduced populations of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile. The screening shows that the symbiont is common in the three native L. humile populations analyzed. In contrast, Wolbachia was detected in only one of the introduced populations. The loss of infection associated with colonization of new habitats may result from drift (founder effect) or altered selection pressures in the new habitat. Furthermore, a molecular phylogeny based on sequences of the Wolbachia wsp gene indicates that L. humile has been infected by a single strain. Horizontal transmission of the symbiont may be important in ants as suggested by the sequence similarity of strains in the three genera Linepithema, Acromyrmex, and Solenopsis native from South and Central America.",

    "abstract": "Across the globe, temperatures are predicted to increase with consequences for many taxonomic groups. Arthropods are particularly at risk as temperature imposes physiological constraints on growth, survival, and reproduction. Given that arthropods may be disproportionately affected in a warmer climate\u0014the question becomes which taxa are vulnerable and can we predict the supposed winners and losers of climate change? To address this question, we resurveyed 33 ant communities, quantifying 20-yr differences in the incidence of 28 genera. Each North American ant community was surveyed with 30 1-m2 plots, and the incidence of each genus across the 30 plots was used to estimate change. From the original surveys in 1994\u00131997 to the resurveys in 2016\u00132017, temperature increased on average 1∞C (range, \u00120.4∞C to 2.5∞C) and ~64% of ant genera increased in more than half of the sampled communities. To test Thermal Performance Theory's prediction that genera with higher average thermal limits will tend to accumulate at the expense of those with lower limits, we quantified critical thermal maxima (CTmax: the high temperatures at which they lose muscle control) and minima (CTmin: the low temperatures at which ants first become inactive) for common genera at each site. Consistent with prediction, we found a positive decelerating relationship between CTmax and the proportion of sites in which a genus had increased. CTmin, by contrast, was not a useful predictor of change. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.85) between the proportion of sites where a genus was found with higher incidence after 20 yr and the average difference in number of plots occupied per site, suggesting genera with high CTmax values tended to occupy more plots at more sites after 20 yr.

Moreover, our genomic analyses revealed that the emergence of the formicoids was accompanied by an elevated number of positive selection events.  Importantly, the top 3 gene functions under selection are linked to key features of complex eusociality, with histone acetylation being implicated in caste differentiation, gene silencing by RNA in worker sterility, and autophagy in longevity.  These results show that the key pathways associated with eusociality have been under strong selection during the Cretaceous, suggesting that the molecular foundations of complex eusociality may have evolved rapidly in less than 20 Ma.]",

    "abstract": "*[We evaluated the influence of intraguild predation among generalist insect predators on the suppression of an herbivore, the aphid Aphis gossypii, to test the appropriateness of the simple three trophic level mode.  We manipulated components of the predator community, including 3 hemipteran predators & larvae of the predatory green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea, in field enclosure/exclosure experiments.   Direct observations of predation in the field demonstrated that several generalist predators consume C. carnea & other carnivorous arthropods.  Severely reduced survivorship of lacewing larvae in the presence of other predators showed that intraguild predation was a major source of mortality.  Intraguild predation created significant interactions between the influences of lacewings & either Zelus renardii or Nabis predators on aphid population suppression.  We conclude that intraguild predation in this system is wide-spread and has potentially important influences on the population dynamics of a key herbivore.  Eleven of the 80 replicates were lost due to predation by ants, Solenopsis xyloni McCook, which chewed holes in the cages, tended the aphids, & may have attacked other predators.  We did not attempt to assess the importance of Solenopsis ants during our experimentation.  These ants may be important generalist predators in some cases, and warrant additional investigation.  The loss of 11 of 80 replicates during experiment-2 may, however, overestimate the general impact of ants for at least 2 reasons.   First, the field had what appeared to be an unusually high density of ants.  Second, our practice of removing plants adjacent to the experimental plant resulted in a focusing of ant foraging activity on the experimental plant.  It was for this reason that we put a sticky ant barrier on plants during experiment 3, when a 2 x 4 m area was cleared of plants except for the central 4 experimental plants.]   *[Yet another well designed study, ignores the most common predator present in the plots.]",

The assays included were 1 live-1 dead ant interactions, live 1-1 battles, live 5-5 battles, & 1 ant introduced to a foreign colony.  We tested 6-ant colonies in all pairwise combinations using 4 different assays and 2 to 3 scoring methods per assay.  We also conducted a colony merging experiment, to see which assays were capable of predicting this ecologically important event.   We found that scoring methods within assays yielded very similar results, giving us no reason to favor observationally intense procedures, such as continuous scanning, over less observationally intense systems, such as snapshot surveys.  Assays differed greatly in their consistency between replicates.   No 2 replicates of the 1 live-1 dead assay were significantly correlated. The live 5-5 & the colony introduction assays were the most consistent across replicates.  The mean scores of the live 1-1, live 5-5, & colony introduction assays were all significantly correlated with each other; only the live 5-5 assay was significantly correlated with the 1 live-1 dead assay.  Assays that utilized the greatest number of live ants were the most likely to reveal high levels of aggression.  The aggression scores of all, but the 1 live-1 dead assay were positively correlated with the number of ants, that died during whole colony encounters & negatively associated with colony merging.  We conclude that all live ant assays tested are useful tools for analyzing aggressive interactions between colonies, but that the pairing of a live & dead ant produced inconsistent results & generally lower levels of aggression.  We found relatively low consistency between trials using the live 1-1 assay, but found that with sufficient replication its results were highly correlated with the assays using more interacting ants.  We suggest that isolated aggressive acts in assays do not necessarily predict whole colony interactions: some colonies that fought in bioassays merged when the entire colonies were allowed to interact.]",

    "abstract": "AIM: To examine the relationship between island characteristics (area, distance to the nearest continent, climate and human population size) and ant species richness, as well as the factors underlying global geographical clustering of native and exotic ant composition on islands. LOCATION: One hundred and two islands from 20 island groups around the world. METHODS: We used spatial linear models that consider the spatial structure of islands to examine patterns of ant species richness. We also performed modularity analyses to identify clusters of islands hosting a similar suite of species and constructed conditional inference trees to assess the characteristics of islands that explain the formation of these island-ant groups. RESULTS: Island area was the best predictor of ant species richness. However, distance to the nearest continent was an important predictor of native ant species richness, as was human population size for exotic species richness. Native species appear slightly more modulated (i.e. well grouped in species assemblages that are present over a distinct cluster of islands) than are exotic species. Exotic species, while still exhibiting some modularity, tended to be widely distributed among island groups. Interestingly, ocean currents accounted for most of the variation in modularity and thus species composition for both native and exotic ant species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous work, both native and exotic species appeared to be confined to particular island regions, and patterns in the distribution of both native and exotic species were limited by a similar suite of factors. However, the distribution of exotic ant species appeared to be more influenced by human\u0010related variables and less structured relative to those of native ant species, perhaps due to the long\u0010term (and increasing) influence of human\u0010mediated dispersal that favours exotic species.",

Workers foraged throughout the other cooler months, albeit at a much reduced level.  The number of foragers was directly associated with early morning & late afternoon temperature.   As temperature at 1600 hours increased, the number of foragers increased.  Sucrose & honey water & solid foods containing insect protein were the most preferred food throughout the year.  During the summer months, 26% to 60% (wt.) of the food foraged by workers was protein, whereas this dropped to 16% to 40% during the winter.   When given a choice between carbohydrates & protein bait-bases throughout the study, L. humile foraged considerably more carbohydrate.  Presuming that foraging choice reflects the nutritional needs within the colony, these data suggest colony requirements for protein may be greater than initially suspected.  Optimal baiting programs might include protein baits in the early summer & liquid sucrose baits in summer & early fall.]",

    "abstract": "The development of effective baits to control the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), has been problematic because foragers prefer sweet liquids, while many toxicants are insoluble in water and liquid baits are generally difficult to deliver. The incorporation of thiamethoxam and sucrose solutions into a water-absorbing polyacrylamide hydrogel provides a unique and novel carrier and method of application for liquid baits. Formulations of thiamethoxam affected the size of the hydrogels, and sucrose solutions containing 0.0003% technical thiamethoxam provided hydrogels as large as those made with 25% sucrose solution or deionized water. Concentrations of thiamethoxam as low as 0.000075% in the hydrogels provided 50% kill of workers within 3 d in a laboratory setting. In small colony studies, baiting with 0.00015 and 0.000075% thiamethoxam hydrogels provided 100% mortality of workers and queens within 8 d. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that thiamethoxam was absorbed into the interior of the polyacrylamide matrix. The water loss rates of the hydrogels were dependent upon the relative humidity. Polyacrylamide hydrogels with >50% water loss were less attractive to ants. Field studies in highly infested areas indicated that concentrations of 0.0006 or 0.0018% thiamethoxam were more effective than 0.00015%. Hydrogels may provide a cost-effective alternative to providing aqueous baits to control Argentine ants.",

Each ant species was significantly overdispersed, and the average intraspecific nearest neighbor distances were greater than the interspecific nearest neighbor distances. A test of pairwise spatial arrangment showed that all three species pairs were aggregated interspecifically.  The level of the interspecific aggregation was related to the diet similarity of the species. The two species pairs with the lowest diet overlaps were significantly aggregated and the species pair with the most similar diets aws not significantly aggregated. Pairwise dietary overlaps between colonies showed that average intraspecific overlaps were significantly greater than interspecific diet overlaps. Furthermore, the diet overlap was significantly positively correlated to the mean nearest neighbor distance for the three intraspecific and three interspecific comparisons. These data indicate competition for food, especially within species, may be regulating the intercolony distances betwen these ant species. A computer simulation tested whether only intraspecific territoriality is necessary to produce the nearest neighbor distances. A simulation that placed colonies randomly on a patch confirmed that these colonies are intraspecifically overdispersed. By adding intraspecific territoriality, the simulation nearest neighbor distances fit the empirical data reasonably well. Thus interspecific competitive interactions seem unnecessary to account for the spatial arrangement of these species.",

Here we report the results of 3\u0014yr neighbor\u0014removal and food\u0014addition experiments that tested for the presence of intraspecific and interspecific competition between colonies. We followed the responses of territory use, diet breadth, foraging activity, and reproductive output (alate production) to the treatments. Both territory use and alate production patterns were consistent with the predictions of intraspecific resource competition. We found to evidence for interspecific effects between colonies. Specifically, Veromessor pergandi \"neighbor\u0014removed\" colonies foraged randomly throughout the treatments, while control colonies tended to forage away from their nearest conspecific neighbor when resource levels were low. Both food\u0014supplemented and neighbor\u0014removed V. pergandei colonies produced proportionately more alates than control colonies. There were no treatment effects on diet breadth or foraging activity at V. pergandei or Pogonomyrmex californicus colonies. Since other experiments on desert granivores have shown significant competitive effects on colony density over the same time scale, the lack of consistent effects of competition was most likely due to: (1) differences between the communities in relation to seed storage and productivity and (2) the fact that our experiments only tested for competition between established colonies and did not consider potential competitive effects of established colonies on alate survival (colony regeneration).",

    "abstract": "Research that connects the effects of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem services is lacking. Ants perform multifarious ecological functions that stabilize ecosystems and contribute to a number of ecosystem services. We studied responses of ant communities to urbanization in the Lake Tahoe basin by sampling sites along a gradient of urban land development. We sampled ant communities, measured vegetation characteristics, quantified human activities, and evaluated ant-community responses by grouping ants into service-providing units (SPUs), defined as a group of organisms and their populations that perform specific ecosystem services, to provide an understanding of urbanization impacts on biodiversity and their delivery of ecosystem services. Species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate levels of urban development, as did the richness of 3 types of ant SPUs (aerators, decomposers, and compilers). With increasing land development aerator and decomposer ants significantly declined in abundance, whereas compiler ants significantly increased in abundance. Competing models demonstrated that precipitation was frequently among the strongest influences on ant community structure; however, urban development and human activities also had a strong, negative influence on ants, appearing in most models with delta-AICc < 2 for species richness and abundance patterns of SPUs and generalists. Response diversity was observed within SPUs, which suggests that the corresponding ecosystem services were maintained until development reached 30-40%. Our data provide evidence that ecosystem functions, such as water infiltration and soil productivity, may be diminished at sites subject to greater levels of urbanization and that conserving ant communities and the ecosystem services they provide could be an important target in land-use planning and conservation efforts.

The effects of ammonium nitrogen enrichment on resources of larval mosquitoes, larval mosquito abundance, adult mosquito production, and the abundance of related wetland organisms were examined in 0.1-ha replicate treatment wetlands. The hypothesis of a bottom-up effect induced by ammonium addition was not supported by bacterial abundance, mean bacterial cell size, or algal biomass in the water column. There was, however, a significant negative correlation between bacterial cell length and Culex tarsalis Coquillett (Diptera: Culicidae) larval abundance 1 wk later in wetlands enriched with ammonium nitrogen. Larval mosquito (Culex spp.) abundance in southern California wetlands enriched with NHÑ-N (mean HH3 mg/liter) was significantly greater than in control wetlands at ambient nitrogen levels (8.3 mg NOÉ-N/liter, 0.1 mg NHÑ-N/liter). Adult mosquito production was nine-fold greater and chironomid larvae were significantly more abundant in wetlands enriched with NHÑ-N than in controls but other censused taxa exhibited no significant trends. Mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis (Baird & Girard), abundance was significantly reduced in enriched wetlands, but other potential mosquito predators were not significantly affected by ammonium enrichment.          *[Argentine ants, Linepithema humile Mayr, invaded the collection jars on the emergence traps & consumed many of the emerged insects that had accumulated during each of the first 3 wk.  Attempts were made to limit access of the ants to collection jars by removing vegetation touching the exterior of the trap, but this was unsuccessful.  After the third week of the study, a Vaportape II pest control strip was added to each collection jar.  This treatment effectively deterred the ants.

We observed an interaction between soil carbon and nitrogen composition and elevation in each mountain range. At lower elevations, nest soil had lower amounts of carbon and nitrogen than control soil, but at higher elevations, nest soil had higher amounts of carbon and nitrogen than control soil. However, our sampling method may only breach the interior of ant nests in some environments. The nest soil moisture did not show any elevational patterns in either mountain range.

    "abstract": "*[I investigate a social parasitism by examining the lives the parasite involved.  I use a variety of techniques to understand the population genetics, host acquisition behaviors, & space-use of an obligate parasitic ant, Polyergus mexicanus, that conducts raids to steal the brood of its host species (several Formica spp.) & makes them \"slave\" workers in the parasite's nest.  In Chapter 1, I use microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of the parasite population at 3 scales: subpopulations, neighboring nests, & among nestmates.  I found that there are 3 very distinct subpopulations that often (but not always) predict host-use patterns.  Neighboring nests are sometimes closely related, enabling potential kin selection.  Lastly, parasite nestmates are overwhelmingly full siblings, yet there were numerous nestmates that must have come from different parents, suggesting that raiding parasites may also steal conspecific brood for enslavement.  In Chapter 2, I characterize raids from an optimal foraging perspective.  I found that parasitic colonies that send more raiders further distances obtain more brood on their raids.  Nests that are capable of larger raids in general had a higher success rate, & more variability in raid sizes, but not distances.  These findings suggest that raids are tailored to the expected quality of the host nest target, & that larger nests have more flexibility in their raiding tactics.  In Chapter 3, I investigate intraspecific competition, aggression, & territoriality among parasites by looking at the spatial arrangement of P. mexicanus nests & raids relative to their conspecific neighbors & their host species.  I found that nests were often overdispersed, a classic sign of intraspecific competition.  Contrary to my predictions, raids from neighboring nests that shared host species overlapped more than those that used different host species.]",

    "abstract": "The genetic structure of populations can be both a cause and a consequence of ecological interactions. For parasites, genetic structure may be a consequence of preferences for host species or of mating behaviour. Conversely, genetic structure can influence where conspecific interactions among parasites lay on a spectrum from cooperation to conflict. We used microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of a population of the socially parasitic dulotic (aka \u001cslave\u0010making\u001d) ant (Polyergus mexicanus), which is known for its host\u0010specificity and conspecific aggression. First, we assessed whether the pattern of host species use by the parasite has influenced parasite population structure. We found that host species use was correlated with subpopulation structure, but this correlation was imperfect: some subpopulations used one host species nearly exclusively, while others used several. Second, we examined the viscosity of the parasite population by measuring the relatedness of pairs of neighbouring parasitic ant colonies at varying distances from each other. Although natural history observations of local dispersal by queens suggested the potential for viscosity, there was no strong correlation between relatedness and distance between colonies. However, 35% of colonies had a closely related neighbouring colony, indicating that kinship could potentially affect the nature of some interactions between colonies of this social parasite. Our findings confirm that ecological forces like host species selection can shape the genetic structure of parasite populations, and that such genetic structure has the potential to influence parasite\u0010parasite interactions in social parasites via inclusive fitness.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to provide a detailed taxonomic resource for identifying and studying ants in the genus Pheidole that have established beyond their native ranges. There is an increasing need for systematists to study taxa of specific concern to 21‚W century environmental, food security and public health challenges. Systematics has an important role to play in both the theoretical and applied disciplines of invasion biology. Few invaders impact terrestrial ecosystems more than ants. Among the world\u0019s 100 worst invasive species is the cosmopolitan and highly destructive Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius). Accurate identification of Pheidole megacephala is imperative for the success of screening, management and eradication programs designed to protect native ecosystems from the impacts of this destructive species. However, accurate identification of Pheidole species is difficult because of their taxonomic diversity, dimorphic worker caste and lack of taxonomic resources. Illustrated keys are included, along with the taxonomic history, taxonomic diagnoses, biological notes and risk statements for the 14 most invasive members of the genus. Global distribution maps based on over 14,000 specimen and literature records are presented for each species. These results of this work will facilitate identification of pest species, determination of climatic and habitat requirements, discovery of pest origins, horizon scanning and assessment of invasion pathways. The following new synonym is proposed, with the senior synonym listed first and the junior synonyms in parentheses: Pheidole indica Mayr (= Pheidole teneriffana Forel, and its synonyms Pheidole taina Aguayo and Pheidole voeltzkowii Forel). Pheidole navigans Forel, stat. rev., stat. n. is removed from synonymy and elevated to species rank. It is proposed that records of Pheidole moerens Forel outside of the Mesoamerica and the Caribbean refer instead to Pheidole navigans or other heterospecific taxa in the Pheidole flavens species complex. We propose that the names Pheidole anastasii Emery and Pheidole floridana Emery have been widely misapplied to North American outdoor records of Pheidole bilimeki Mayr. It is suggested that the synonymy of Pheidole lauta Wheeler be transferred from Pheidole floridana Emery to Pheidole bilimeki Mayr.",

Specimens of the species reported here were collected November 2011 from an established colony on Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu, during a survey of the island's ant fauna.  Morphological & genetic analyses revealed these Vanuatu specimens belong to the Neotropical P. flavens group.  The DNA sequence data most closely matched those of 2 specimens previously determined as P. moerens Wheeler and P. flavens Roger.  A closely related taxon currently being treated as P. moerens Wheeler was reported from Hawaii in 2005.  Preliminary morphological analysis suggests that the Vanuatu population reported here represents a different species than the Hawaii P. moerens.  However, a valid species name cannot be confidently applied to either the Hawaii population or the Vanuatu population until a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the flavens-complex is completed.  Species of the Pheidole flavens-complex are occasionally considered pest ants, but have not been documented as causing significant harm to native species, food security or public health.  However, the recent spread of species in this complex across the SE United States, recent introductions to California & Hawaii, & the recent discovery in Vanuatu suggests their potential for human-mediated dispersal & establishment.  We hope that raising awareness of this new incursion will improve the chances of early detection & eradication before the species spreads further into the Pacific Island region.

    "abstract": "The frequency and intensity of hurricanes are increasing globally, and anthropogenic modifications in cities have created systems that may be particularly vulnerable to their negative effects. Organisms living in cities are exposed to variable levels of chronic environmental stress. However, whether chronic stress ameliorates or exacerbates the negative effects of hurricanes remains an open question. Here, we consider two hypotheses about the simultaneous consequences of acute disturbances from hurricanes and chronic stress from urbanization for the structure of urban arthropod communities. The tipping point hypothesis posits that organisms living in high stress habitats are less resilient than those in low stress habitats because they are living near the limits of their environmental tolerances; while the disturbance tolerance hypothesis posits that high stress habitats host organisms pre\u0010adapted for coping with disturbance, making them more resilient to the effects of storms. We used a before\u0010after\u0010control\u0010impact design in the street medians and city parks of Manhattan (New York City, New York, USA) to compare arthropod communities before and after Super Storm Sandy in sites that were flooded and unflooded during the storm. Our evidence supported the disturbance tolerance hypothesis. Significant compositional differences between street medians and city parks before the storm disappeared after the storm; similarly, unflooded city parks had significantly different arthropod composition while flooded sites were indistinguishable. These differences were driven by reduced occurrences and abundances of arthropods in city parks. Finally, those arthropod groups that were most tolerant to urban stress were also the most tolerant to flooding. Our results suggest that the species that survive in high stress environments are likely to be the ones that thrive in response to acute disturbance.

    "abstract": "Respiratory water loss (RWL) in insects showing continuous emission of CO2 is poorly studied because few methodologies can measure it. Comparisons of RWL between insects showing continuous and discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGC) are therefore difficult. We used two recently developed methodologies (the hyperoxic switch and correlation between water-loss and CO2 emission rates) to compare cuticular permeabilities and rates of RWL in five species of ants, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) and four common native ant competitors. Our results showed that RWL in groups of ants with moderate levels of activity and continuous gas exchange were similar across the two measurement methods, and were similar to published values on insects showing the DGC. Furthermore, ants exposed to anoxia increased their total water loss rates by 50-150%. These results suggest that spiracular control under continuous gas exchange can be as effective as the DGC in reducing RWL. Finally, the mesic-adapted Argentine ant showed significantly higher rates of water loss and cuticular permeability compared to four ant species native to dry environments. Physiological limitations may therefore be responsible for restricting the distribution of this invasive species in seasonally dry environments.  (abstract provided by author).",

    "abstract": "Little attention has been given to the effect of physiological limitations on the ability of introduced species to invade ecological communities. In the present study, the water balance of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is compared with five common ant species native to southern California. Total and critical water contents are measured, as well as rates of water loss and survival times. The results show that the body size of ant species has a strong effect on water balance, explaining between 99% of total and 90% of critical water content (i.e. the amount of water remaining when the ant becomes moribund). The measured survival times at 40 ∞C and approximately 0% relative humidity are shorter for L. humile than for the other five native ant species. The area-independent water-loss rate is higher for L. humile than for the other native ant species studied. This finding is corroborated by independent data using two different methods (i.e. gravimetric measurement and open-flow respirometry).   Somewhat surprisingly, significant differences in the water-loss rates of different sizes of Solenopsis xyloni workers are found, even after adjusting for surface area. The area-independent water-loss rate is significantly lower for larger than for smaller workers.   Consistent with circumstantial evidence from the field, the results suggest that the physiological constraints of invasive species, such as water-loss rates and critical water content, can limit their distribution and abundance not only at regional scales, but also at fine scales.",

Sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene revealed 2 major lineages of different, but partially overlapping geographic distributions, both occurring in Central Europe.  The existence of a cryptic species within M. cf. structor is the most plausible interpretation, since the sequence divergence between the 2 major lineages equals those between M. capitatus, M. concolor, & M. bouvieri.

    "abstract": "Dicentra uniflora Kellogg (Papaveraceae), a small, single-flowered, ephemeral geophyte, was studied at three main and several secondary forest sites at the southern end of the Cascade Range in California (2009-2018). Emergence was closely linked to snowmelt, with flowering to senescence taking six to seven weeks, at elevations ranging from 1350-2575 m. Plants transitioned from flowering to fruit maturation within three weeks. Percent seed set in this perennial was high, ranging from 81-93% over five sites; seeds per fruit ranged from 44-83. In 2018, weekly field observations quantified the fate of flowers on plants staked when flowers appeared: only 27-43% of the flowers produced mature fruits with seeds, 23-24% dried up, and 25-30% disappeared, often leaving the pedicels. Black-tailed deer are suspected to be the primary herbivore, although nocturnal larvae of the butterfly Parnassius clodius, known to consume Dicentra leaves, may also be responsible at higher elevations. Each seed bears an easily-dislodged elaiosome, but little of the expected seed dispersal by ants was seen throughout the study. Field plantings of seeds illustrated that germination can occur in winter, below the snow, with seedlings bearing only a single cotyledon emerging from the ground in the spring. A seedling quickly produces a tiny food-storing, belowground bulblet before disappearing with the summer drought of the Mediterranean-type climate. The second-year plant produces a new bulblet and sometimes a tiny tuber, but only a single leaf, and plantings in the field suggest that it may take up to 10 years or more before an individual reaches flowering stage. A flowering plant has one or two fusiform tubers approximately 21 mm long and a cluster of ~9 whitish bulblets approximately 4 mm long. Published research in the closely-related D. cucullaria (L.) Bernh. indicates that bulblets are undeveloped food-storage leaf bases unique to four species of Dicentra, capable of giving rise to small plants and providing food for plant development. Bulblets planted in this field study clearly indicate they are capable of asexual reproduction. As in some other geophytes, dry weight of D. uniflora tubers was significantly greater in June at the beginning of the summer drought than in November when the plants began renewed root growth early in the fall wet season. The depth to the tops of tubers on plants occurring in clusters varied from 3.2-10.7 cm in the rocky, loamy or sandy-loamy soils of these sites.",

    "abstract": "Animals are often forced to accommodate disturbance to their territories or nests. When nest relocation becomes necessary, it is important to efficiently evaluate alternative nest sites to choose the one most suitable under current conditions. However, if time is limiting, species may experience a speed-versus-accuracy trade-off when searching for a new home. We examined nest site selection under duress (in the form of flooding) in two species of ants: Linepithema humile and Tapinoma sessile. We predicted that if ants are able to assess and evacuate to the most suitable location, colonies should move to higher elevation, relative to their current nest site, in response to flooding. To test for a speed-versus-accuracy trade-off, we presented colonies with new nest chambers that were either higher, lower, or at the same height as their current nest and examined if their ability to efficiently choose a new site was influenced by the rate of flooding. When flooding rates were slow, both species favored the highest nest site and nearly always moved their entire nest to the same chamber. However, when the rate of flooding was doubled, colonies of T. sessile less often chose the highest nest site and were also more likely to split their nests between two of the available chambers. These results demonstrate a trade-off between speed and accuracy in nest site selection for odorous house ants, while L. humile retained their ability to adequately assess new nest sites under the conditions we presented. These patterns may arise from differences in exploratory behavior and activity between the two species. Despite having identical colony sizes, L. humile had approximately ten times more workers exploring the alternate nest sites 30 min into the experiment than did T. sessile.",

Regional differences in insect consumption and reasons for being underreported are discussed. We show that North American natives, and in certain cases colonists, collected and consumed a large variety of edible insects.

Through most of this species' range, colonies are founded by single queens, but in some populations nests are instead founded by cooperative groups of unrelated queens.  In mixed groups of cooperative & single-founding queens, we found that aggressive individuals had a survival advantage within their nest, but foundress groups with such non-cooperators died out more often than those with only cooperative members.  An agent-based model shows that the between-group advantage of the cooperative phenotype drives it to fixation, despite its within-group disadvantage, but only when population density is high enough to make between-group competition intense.  Field data show higher nest density in a population where cooperative founding is common, consistent with greater density driving the evolution of cooperative foundation through group selection.]",

    "abstract": "*[Unrelated queens of the ant, Pogonomyrmex californicus, work together to found a new colony, a phenomenon known as pleometrosis.  While previous studies have shown that pleometrosis improves queen survival & worker production, little is known of the behavioral interactions within nests that explain these advantages.  We aimed to determine how the optimal group size for a small, simple social group is related to group productivity & the organization of work.  Collecting queens from a known pleometrotic population, we established nests with either one, 3, 6, or 9 foundresses & observed the resulting nascent colonies for 50 days.  We found that queens in social founding groups survived longer & had higher productivity.  While all social groups were equally successful in producing workers, intermediate-sized groups were most successful in terms of per capita production.  Inactivity increased with group size.  In addition, the proportion of essential colony growth tasks performed (such as foraging & brood care) was lowest in both solitary-founded groups & in groups of 9 queens.  As a result, intermediate sized groups outperformed both solitary queens & groups of 9 in the efficiency with which they converted eggs into workers.  These results emphasize the benefits of cooperation & the ways in which group size can influence fitness & the allocation of labor in social groups.]",

In all details of thoracic structure-size, sculpture, pilosity, the pterergates are identical with normal ergates of this & neighboring nests.  In excavating the nest, guarding the nest, & in harvesting, the pterergates & the normal workers participate equally.  Hence these abnormal ants are certainly workers rather than modified fertile forms, such as pseudogynes, microgynes, and B-females.   The 17 young queens & 2 males, taken from the nest in June, 1920, appear to be normal in every way when compared with queens & males from other nests of the same species.   Grouping the pterergates roughly in order of the development of vestiges, we have the following: 385 with minute veinless wing-sacs, or with stubs of broken wings, 219 with sacs from 0.5 to 1.0 mm. long & indistinct veining, & 132 with transparent, clearly veined winglets from 0.8 to 1.5 mm. long.]",

Conversely, from a single observation of the ant-speed, the temperature can be predicted within 1 degree C.  The activity is less erratic for higher temperatures.  Thus, the percentage probable error, derived for each observation from the deviations of the individual timings, decreases on the average with increasing temperature & speed from about 4% to less than 2%; but for only one observation does the probable error exceed a millimeter a second.  As the temperature rises 30 degrees C, the speed changes 15-fold, increasing uniformly from 0.44 to 6.60 cm a second.  For a large species of Eciton, probably burchelli, observed by Beebe in British Guiana, a normal speed of 7.6-cm a second is recorded, & on a later occasion as speed of 15.2 cm a second.   There appears to be little, if any, real difference in speed towards & away from the nest.  Large & small workers have practically the same speed for all temperatures during the summer months.  After 2 months of low temperature, the large workers are conspicuously more active than the small workers.  This ant runs as numerously in the night as during daylight hours; maximum activity is between noon & midnight.  Within the limits of 14 degrees C to 38 degrees C, temperature appears to have little effect on the number of ants running in the files.]",

An assessment of genetic variation at a diverse set of molecular markers in 2,165 individuals from 75 geographic sites worldwide revealed that at least nine separate introductions of S. invicta have occurred into newly invaded areas (NIAs) and that the main southern USA population is the immediate source of all but one of these introductions. The sole exception involves a putative serial invasion event from the southern USA to California to Taiwan. Given the invasive potential of S. invicta, our study raises concerns about the role of the USA as a conduit for ongoing exportation of this pest ant, as well as other invasive species, throughout large areas of the world.

    "abstract": "Pollinators require resources throughout the year to maintain healthy populations. Along the urban\u0013natural interface, floral resource availability may be limited especially when the system experiences extreme drought and fire threats. In such areas, succulents, such as Aloe spp., are commonly planted to serve as functional drought-tolerant, fire-protective landscaping, which can also support pollinator populations. However, access to this resource may be restricted by competition from other floral foragers, including invasive pests. We measured free-foraging honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) visitation rate and visitation duration to aloe flowers with and without Argentine ants (Linepithema humile (Mayr)) in a drought-stressed environment and found that bees actively avoided foraging on the ant-occupied flowers. To determine the mechanisms of avoidance, our subsequent experiments assessed visitation in the absence of ants and compared aloe flowers treated with ant pheromone to unmanipulated flowers lacking ant pheromone. Bees approached all flowers equally, but accepted flowers without ants at a higher rate than flowers with ants. Visitation duration also increased twofold on ant-excluded flowers, which suggests that Argentine ants may limit resource acquisition by bees. Honey bees similarly avoided flowers with Argentine ant pheromone and preferentially visited unmanipulated flowers at threefold higher rate. This study demonstrates that honey bees avoid foraging on floral resources with invasive Argentine ants and that bees use ant odors to avoid ant-occupied flowers. Resource limitation by this invasive pest ant may have serious implication for sustaining healthy pollinator populations at the urban\u0013natural interface.",

We compared the feeding responses of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr) to liquid and gel compositions of sucrose. In choice assays, more workers were counted on gel than liquid; however, substantially more liquid was consumed. Because workers could stand on the gel, more workers could feed simultaneously on the gel. The feeding bouts of individual workers, however, were much less efficient at extracting sucrose in gel form. Workers fed eightfold longer on the gel, yet removed fivefold less sucrose than workers feeding on liquid. This potential bias should be considered during attraction and palatability studies that use physically different bait compositions. When the toxicant fipronil was added to the compositions, a greater proportion of the colony died after workers had fed on liquid than gel baits. This finding suggests that liquid formulations may provide more effective control of Argentine ants due to the greater speed and abundance in which it is ingested.",

Female C. perminutus preferred second-instar P. ficus for oviposition, and produced more adult offspring (149.3 per female) than A. nr. sp. pseudococci (54.1 per female). The development time, from egg to adult emergence, of C. perminutus decreased with increasing constant temperatures between 18.5 and 30.1∞C; at lower (12.0 and 15.0∞C) and higher (31.1, 32.7, and 34.2∞C) temperatures, the parasitoid did not develop. The lower threshold was calculated by linear methods to be 10.97∞C, and the thermal constant was calculated to be 507.98 degree-days. The development times of C. perminutus were longer than those of A. nr. sp. pseudococci, and C. perminutus had narrower temperature tolerances than P. ficus or A. pseudococci. Argentine ants (Linepithema humile (Mayr)) reduced the amount of time C. perminutus foraged on mealybug-infested squash, but did not affect the number of oviposition attempts or offspring produced, whereas Argentine ants reduced A. nr. sp. pseudococci foraging time, oviposition attempts, and number of offspring obtained. Overall, the results suggest that under certain conditions, including optimal conditions of temperature and host-stage availability, C. perminutus outperforms A. nr. sp. pseudococci, and may be an effective augmentative control agent even when ants are tending the hosts. However, temperature limitations and host-stage selection behaviors would reduce C. perminutus performance in the field, and in the absence of ants, other parasitoids may be favored.",

    "abstract": "Ants are some of the most abundant and familiar animals on Earth, and they play vital roles in most terrestrial ecosystems. Although all ants are eusocial, and display a variety of complex and fascinating behaviors, few genomic resources exist for them. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of a particularly widespread and well-studied species, the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), which was accomplished using a combination of 454 (Roche) and Illumina sequencing and community-based funding rather than federal grant support. Manual annotation of >1,000 genes from a variety of different gene families and functional classes reveals unique features of the Argentine ant\u0019s biology, as well as similarities to Apis mellifera and Nasonia vitripennis. Distinctive features of the Argentine ant genome include remarkable expansions of gustatory (116 genes) and odorant receptors (367 genes), an abundance of cytochrome P450 genes (>110), lineage-specific expansions of yellow/major royal jelly proteins and desaturases, and complete CpG DNA methylation and RNAi toolkits. The Argentine ant genome contains fewer immune genes than Drosophila and Tribolium, which may reflect the prominent role played by behavioral and chemical suppression of pathogens. Analysis of the ratio of observed to expected CpG nucleotides for genes in the reproductive development and apoptosis pathways suggests higher levels of methylation than in the genome overall. The resources provided by this genome sequence will offer an abundance of tools for researchers seeking to illuminate the fascinating biology of this emerging model organism.",

    "abstract": "*[Tapinoma sessile Say, a native North American ant, is of considerable economic importance as a house pest not only in Urbana, Illinois, but in localities in California, Nevada, District of Columbia, Maryland, & Mississippi.  The synonymy & a redescription of the species are given.  The immature stages of the ant are described.  The common name, the odorous house ant, is applied to the species for the first time.  The ants overwinter outdoors as dealate females, workers, & larvae.  Workers begin foraging as early as March 7th.  Egg laying & the uniform development of the brood begins in late April & continues until cold weather in the fall or approximately November 1st.  The overwintering larvae attain maturity in April, having required from 6 to 7 months to attain maturity.  From April through June, workers can be produced in from 5 to 9 weeks, whereas during the period of July through September, they require only 6 to 7 weeks to attain maturity.  Four to 5 generations of workers a year are postulated.  Alate females were observed at various dates ranging from June 17th to early July.  Males appeared from June 10th to July 9th.  Only large & strong colonies seem capable of producing sex-forms.  Mating probably takes place both in & outside of the nest.  Colonies range from a 100 to 10,000 individuals.  The average colony contains from 2,000 to 5,000 individuals, many of which are dealated females; one colony contained over 200 dealated females.  Some of the workers lay eggs.  The brood reared from such eggs attained the prepupal stage, before they were eaten by the workers.  It is believed that if they had attained maturity the adults would have been workers.  Development of brood from worker eggs apparently takes longer than the development of brood from female eggs.  The ants show a wide diversity in their nesting habits.  Nests have been found in houses; under the bark of logs & stumps, in galls on plants, in stems of plants, under debris, & in the soil.  The species is apparently eurythermal in disposition as it is found throughout most of North America from the sands of the seashore to heights of over 10,000 feet & from boggy locations to perfectly dry inland spots.  Workers have been seen foraging at temperatures as low as 50 degrees Fahrenheit.  The natural food of the ants is honeydew, supplemented by the flesh of organisms.  In houses they feed on fruits, vegetables, meats, & sweets, but seem to show a preference for sweets.]",

    "month": "Published: May 1936",
    "abstract": "The history of Iridomyrmex humilis [Linepithema humile], Mayr (Argentine ant) in the United States, its habits and response to ecological factors, the damage it does and the means by which it spreads, are described from the literature. A survey to determine its distribution and abundance was made from the autumn of 1931 to the spring of 1933. The survey covered towns in 18 southern and eastern States. Approximately 4, 000 sq. miles, lying almost entirely in the southern States and California, were found to be infested, and the area of infestation is considered likely to increase. Although I. humilis is a tropical insect, prevented from spreading northwards by prolonged, severe winters, it appears to be more tolerant of cold than any other ant in the south, with the exception of Prenolepis imparis, Say. It is very susceptible to winds and, though it requires moisture, was never seen in water-logged habitats.  Mississippi was the first State to organize the control of I. humilis [R.A.E., A 12 585; 13 622; 17 524], and regular campaigns were carried out there as early as 1920. In 1933, the author and L. C. Murphree investigated the methods used in this State and the effectiveness of the suppression campaigns. These had freed 39 out of 245 infested localities and reduced infestations in nearly all others. The procedure was to delimit the infested areas by scouting when the temperature was above 70∞F., dispose cups of poison in these areas and leave them for the whole season. During the course of the work in Mississippi, 3 types of containers have been used: tin cans, aluminium cups and cups made of heavy paraffined paper. The tin cans were discarded on account of cost. The aluminium cups are light and easily transported and can be used for more than one year, but they are not large enough to keep the syrup from drying up, are easily submerged, and their cost is about 10.5 times that of the paper cups, which were ultimately adopted. These resemble small drinking cups with lids and hold approximately 10.5 fi. oz. There are 4 small holes for the ants near the top but beneath the lid. The poison is a syrup containing sodium arsenite [8 285], which should meet the following specifications: sodium arsenite 0.16 per cent., tartaric acid 0.06 per cent., solids 50.0∞ Brix. It should not be exposed to exceedingly low or high temperatures and should never be placed in a receptacle that has contained oil, kerosene, or grease, which are very repellent to ants. The cups are usually suspended on brackets and should be placed 20-25 ft. apart, 5-6 ft. from the ground on houses and 6 ins. from the ground on the outside of fences enclosing livestock, and concealed as much as possible. They can also be set in the crowns of dense plants or partly buried in well-drained soil and covered with clods of earth. It is desirable to poison 50-75 ft. beyond the limit of infestation. Poisoning is best carried out in the autumn or winter, when honey-dew is scarce and a temperature of 50-60∞F. stimulates feeding. The greatest reduction in the number of ants takes place during the first 2 months. In the summer following the first campaign in a given locality, 95-100 per cent. of the reports are usually satisfactory. The same quantities should be used for the second year, and according to the reports obtained it can be determined to what extent the quantity of supplies can be reduced in the third campaign. Usually 3-5 campaigns are necessary to effect eradication. Intensive scouting should be continued for 2 summers after the area appears to be free from ants.  Eradication may be hastened by burning movable wood containing colonies of ants and pouring kerosene on tree stumps and setting fire to them. Digging colonies out of the soil and burning them is very expensive and only practicable where eradication is almost complete.

Acamatus fuscipennis Cresson cited by Wheeler, 1908: 417 (male) is a Nomen nudum.    N. mandibularis (M. R. Smith) is elevated to species level, new status, having previously been regarded as a subspecies of N. pilosus (F. Smith).  One species, N. graciellae (Mann) is recorded from the United States (Arizona) for the first time.  Four new species are described: N. goyahkla (southern Arizona; workers only), N. kiowapache (Kansas to southern Arizona; all castes), N. ndeh (southern Arizona; males only), & N. wilsoni (southern California; workers).  New keys are presented for the separation of worker & male castes of all known United States species, and most species are illustrated.   N. californicus has been observed preying on Messor andrei, Pheidole californica, P. hyatti, Solenopsis molesta, & S. xyloni.  The wingless phorid fly, Xanionotum hystrix Brues, has been associated with a colony of N. californicus collected in San Diego County, California.   N. nigrescens has been observed preying on Formica moki, Messor andrei, Pheidole californica, P. desertorum, P. hyatti, P. obtusospinosa, Solenopsis geminata, S. molesta, & Tetramorium caespitum.  Dacnophora, Cremersia, & Xanionotum (Phoridae) are known to parasitize adults of N. nigrescens.  The diapriid wasp, Ecitovagus gibbus Masner has been found as a parasitoid of N. nigrescens in SE Arizona.  Myrmecophilous Staphylinidae (Coleoptera) associated with N. nigrescens include: Microdonia laticollis Brues, M. nitidiventris Brues, M. occipitalis Casey, Ecitoxenidia brevicornis Seevers, E. brevipes Brues, Dinocoryna carolinensis Seevers, and Ecitonidia wheeleri Wasmann.  The carabid beetles Helluomorphoides ferrugineus Casey & H. latitarsis LeConte are specialized predators on both the booty & brood of N. nigrescens in southeastern Arizona.  One California sample of N. nyensis consists of a single specimen taken from a foraging worker of Forelius maccooki (Forel).  Workers of N. opacithorax were discovered during the processing of a number twig cuttings which contained a colony of Pseudomyrmex championi (Forel) in Guatemala.  The only prey records for N. rugulosus are other ant species, Pheidole desertorum & Trachymyrmex arizonensis.]",

Because these male species cannot now be associated with workers, the present list is assumed to be inflated.   Wilson (1959b) recorded 11 species of from New Guinea, six of which were noted to be present at the Lower Busu River site (not four as stated by Wilson 1959c). At Ivimka, ten species Cerapachys, Cerapachyinae, were recorded, of these, 7 appear to be new species.   At Ivimka, the subfamily Dolichoderinae includes only a few species of non-stinging ants, most of which are arboreal.  Fifteen species were encountered at Ivimka, of which 2 are non-native.  Tapinoma melanocephalum is a now tropicopolitan tramp species originally from Africa.  Technomyrmex albipes is of Asian origin & now widespread from India to Australia, Oceania, & California.  These are both insinuators that have apparently minimal impact on established native species.   Formicinae is among the 3 most species rich in the Ivimka area with 58 species in 9 genera.  The genus Polyrachis is the most species rich ant genus with 28 species recorded during the survey.  The subfamily also includes the largest ant species found, Camponotus dorycus.  Among the specimens collected on the survey are one undescribed species of Echinopla, one of Paratrechina, & 3 of Polyrhachis.   The Myrmicinae is by far the most species rich subfamily in the Lakekamu Basin with 103 species in 26 genera.  Members of the subfamily represent a diverse array of habits, including predators to coccid-tending exudate feeders.  At least 7 collected species are new species & at least one represents a new genus.   A total of 57 species of Ponerinae in 17 genera were collected.

Although the MacKays placed this complex in the subgenus Myrmentoma, it is here removed from that subgenus & left unassigned until the relationships of all the New World subgenera of Camponotus are properly reevaluated, a task beyond the scope of this paper.  Based on an examination of appropriate type material, I have determined that the MacKays misidentified 2 of the species.  Specimens that are a part of the original sample from which C. nitidus Norton was described have been examined; since the name is a junior homonym, a replacement name, C. rectithorax was proposed by Forel (1895).  The 'lectotype' proposed by the MacKays for C. rectithorax Forel, is invalid, since it was not from Norton's original material; a proper lectotype is here designated.  The putative 'lectotype' is actually a syntype of C. montivagus; C. montivagus & C. rectithorax, sensu the Mackays, are thus coextensive.  The species that they incorrectly identified as C. montivagus is equivalent to Norton's species & thus properly bears the name C. rectithorax.  Camponotus montivagus var. nuperus Wheeler 1914 is a synonym of C. rectithorax (new synonymy).  Camponotus pertusus MacKay & MacKay, described from several workers from Trinidad is removed from this species complex & placed in the synonymy of the Nearctic species C. essigi M.R. Smith (new synonymy); the type locality is apparently not the West Indian island of Trinidad, but instead is presumably Trinidad, Humboldt County, California.  The C. montivagus complex is recharacterized in light of the above changes & a new key is presented for the species of this complex.  Each species is represented by appropriate illustrations.]   Note Response by W.P. Mackay and E.E. Mackay, p. 613-615.",

This secretion elicits parental care behavior & is rapidly removed & consumed by the adults.  This behaviour is crucial for pupal survival, because if the secretion is not removed, pupae develop fungal infections & die.  Analogous to mammalian milk, the secretion is also an important source of early larval nutrition, & young larvae exhibit stunted growth & decreased survival without access to the fluid.  We show that this derived social function of the moulting fluid generalizes across the ants.  This secretion thus forms the basis of a central & previously overlooked interaction network in ant societies, & constitutes a rare example of how a conserved developmental process can be co-opted to provide the mechanistic basis of social interactions.  These results implicate moulting fluids in having a major role in the evolution of ant eusociality.]          *[Colonies of N. flavipes, T. sessile, P. pennsylvanica & Lasius neoniger were collected in NY state.

Field tests in which Argentine ants were induced to forage across insecticide-treated surfaces were used to determine the effect that speed of action has on foraging and recruitment ability, and whether these insecticides are repellent. The slower-acting fipronil allowed a greater amount of foraging and consequently a greater fraction of the colony to be exposed, whereas fast-acting bifenthrin, beta-cyfluthrin, and bifenthrin + beta-cyfluthrin inhibited recruitment, resulting in fewer ants being exposed and killed.

In 2009, the impact of the outbreak on the ant community was examined by pitfall-trapping ants in 15 sites that saw high tree mortality ('red' sites) and 15 sites that suffered little or no tree mortality ('green' sites) during the outbreak. Ant species turnover between green and red sites was low, and no invasive species were observed.  However, changes in the abundances of various species resulted in a significant alteration of the ant community.  If the ant community is an accurate bioindicator of other taxa in this forest, the effects of the bark beetle outbreak may be described as dramatic but not catastrophic or irreversible.  The changes in the ant community are consistent with the hypothesis that this community is structured by nest site limitation rather than inter-specific competition or thermal limitation.",

    "abstract": "Urban environments are often associated with reduced biodiversity, presumably because they are typically more fragmented, warmer, and drier than nearby non-urban environments. However, urban landscapes offer significant complexity that have allowed some taxonomic groups to flourish. Understanding how urban-exploiting animals navigate this spatiotemporal heterogeneity is important given the continued global urban land expansion. Here, we examined the factors influencing resource-use in an urban community of ants, which represent a widespread and important taxon in urban ecosystems. In particular, we sought to integrate ants' nutritional, thermal, and spatial niches to better understand how urban animals successfully access critical resources throughout their active season. Meteorological season (spring, summer, and fall) and/or species (n\t=\t9) influenced ants\u0019 preferences for nutrition (ratio of ingested protein-to-carbohydrate ratio), as well as the temperature, type (impervious vs. non-impervious), and shade status (shaded vs. non-shaded) of surfaces used during activity. Our data also indicate links among habitat variables, as well as between nutritional preferences and habitat use. Together, our results suggest that species and seasonality influence ecological (combined nutritional, thermal, and spatial) niches in an urban community. We encourage future work in urban ecosystems that continues to integrate more features of the ecological niche, and to examine the outcomes of variation in niches (e.g., non-overlapping niches may explain both the persistence of some native animals and the success of invaders).",

    "abstract": "Urban systems often support large numbers of non-native species, but due to the heterogeneity of urban landscapes, species are not evenly distributed. Understanding the drivers of ecological resistance in urban landscapes may help to identify habitats that are most resistant to invasion, and inform efforts to model and conserve native biodiversity. We used pitfall traps to survey non-native ground-dwelling arthropods in three adjacent, low-elevation habitat types in southern California: California sage scrub, non-native grassland, and suburban development. We found that non-native species were fewer and less widely distributed in the sage scrub and grassland habitats. Due to the proximity of our sites, differences in propagule pressure is an unlikely explanation. Instead, we suggest that the absence of water subsidies in the sage scrub and grassland habitats increases those habitats&rsquo; resistance to arthropod invasions. Comparisons to studies conducted at fragments closer to the coast provide further support for the relationship between aridity and invasibility in southern California. Our findings highlight that inland fragments are important for conserving native arthropod diversity, that models of non-native species distributions in arid and semi-arid urban systems should include aridity measures, and that reducing resource subsidies across the region is critical to mitigating spread of non-natives.",

    "abstract": "Southern California's sage scrub (SS) ecosystem is severely threatened by suburban development and invasion by non-native grasses, but how these threats impact the arthropod community is poorly understood. Native ants, which face the additional threat of being displaced by non-native Argentine ants, may be particularly at risk of local and regional extirpation. In this study, we surveyed the ant communities in the SS and non-native grassland habitats at the Robert J Bernard Biological Field Station (BFS) and surrounding suburban habitat, and compared patterns of species richness and composition among habitat types. We also compared ant richness and composition at the BFS to 40 coastal SS fragments previously surveyed in San Diego County to better understand how ant communities in interior and coastal SS fragments differ. Ant composition significantly differed among all three habitat types at and surrounding the BFS, but species richness did not. Comparisons between the BFS and coastal fragments indicate that interior SS fragments harbor unique ant species and more species relative to fragment area. Increased richness and unique ant assemblages are probably associated with the limited ability of invasive Argentine ants to colonize the non-native grassland and SS at the BFS. Because many southern California invertebrates are narrowly endemic to low elevation areas, patterns of habitat specificity seen with ants highlight that maintaining a mosaic of SS and non-native grassland habitat, particularly in interior areas where activity and diversity of non-native invertebrate species may be restricted, may be critical to preserving biodiversity.",

Gonocephalum sericeum (Baudi), a widespread, synanthropic species in northern Africa and Middle East, is reported from the Western Hemisphere for the first time. The species is illustrated and diagnosed, and the genus is incorporated into a key to North American Opatrini. Gondwanocrypticus platensis (Fairmaire), a South American species of Crypticini often associated with nest debris of imported fire ants, has spread widely in southern California. Opatroides punctulatus BrullÈ, first discovered in the Sacramento area in 2003-2008, has recently been found in abundance in and around Reno, Nevada and is spreading to new California counties. All three species are thought to be facultative opportunistic ant associates in disturbed habitats.

    "abstract": "The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) is an invasive pest that causes ecological disturbance and economic damage to habitats worldwide. Since its introduction to the United States 75 years ago, the ant has spread across the southeast through Texas into California and causes over $6.5 billion in damages.  Conventional control techniques have not proven effective or long-lasting, leading to a search for alternative methods. We examined the ability of WW-B.Dahl Old World bluestem (Bothriochloa bladhii Retz S.T. Blake), increasingly used in pastures, to limit or reduce ant infestations. Pastures planted with WW-B.Dahl had about one-third the fire ant mounds found in adjacent pastures of native grass or coastal Bermuda  (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers) grass, and the difference is statistically significant (P = 0.0006). No difference was found in the number of ants collected in bait cups or in mound vitality ratings, suggesting that more than one measure of ant infestation is needed to accurately assess ant populations. A reduction in fire ant mounds can improve the efficiency of haying operations and reduce wildlife impacts, suggesting broad uses for WW-B.Dahl in ant-infested areas.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the roles of habitat fragmentation and the invasion of an exotic species on the structure of ground\u0010foraging ant communities in 40 scrub habitat fragments in coastal southern California. In particular, we asked: how do fragment age, fragment size, amount of urban edge, percentage of native vegetation, degree of isolation, and the relative abundance of an exotic species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) affect native ants? Within these fragments, Argentine ants were more abundant near developed edges and in areas dominated by exotic vegetation. The number of native ground\u0010foraging ant species at any point declined from an average of >7 to <2 species in the presence of the Argentine ant. Among fragments, a stepwise multiple regression revealed that the abundance of Argentine ants, the size of the fragment, and the number of years since it was isolated from larger continuous areas of scrub habitat best predict the number of remaining native ant species. The Argentine ant was found in every fragment surveyed as well as around the edges of larger unfragmented areas. Fragments had fewer native ant species than similar\u0010sized plots within large unfragmented areas, and fragments with Argentine ant\u0010free refugia had more native ant species than those without refugia. The relative vulnerability of native ants to habitat fragmentation and the subsequent presence of Argentine ants vary among species. The most sensitive species include army ants (Neivamyrmex spp.) and harvester ants (genera Messor and Pogonomyrmex), both of which are important to ecosystem\u0010level processes. Our surveys suggest that the Argentine ant is widespread in fragmented coastal scrub habitats in southern California and strongly affects native ant communities.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining biodiversity within fragmented landscapes has become a primary focus of ecology. Despite many theoretical and comparative studies on species persistence following fragmentation, experimental studies investigating the mechanisms behind population declines remain rare. In recent years, coastal horned lizards (Phrynosoma coronatum) have disappeared throughout much of their range in coastal southern California. In addition to the direct impact of habitat loss due to urbanization, horned lizard populations continue to decline in the remaining fragmented landscape. One factor that may contribute to their decline is the invasion of exotic species from the surrounding urban matrix. Horned lizards are ant specialists, and they may be particularly vulnerable to changes in the native ant community resulting from the invasion of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). In this study we examined how Argentine ants influence horned lizard growth rates by raising hatchlings on prey typical of invaded and uninvaded sites. Hatchling horned lizards maintained positive growth rates on a diet of just one native ant species (Crematogaster californica). However, on a diet of Argentine ants or arthropods typical of an invaded community, horned lizard growth rates were either negative or averaged near zero. In addition, when lizards were switched from a diet of Argentine ants to native ants, growth rates increased. One factor contributing to growth was foraging rate; capture success appears partly responsible for why horned lizards specialize on ants vs. other, harder to capture, arthropods. Moreover, a comparison of diets among age classes of coastal horned lizards suggests a diversity of ants is necessary to support lizard populations. While stochastic demographic and environmental processes are often invoked to explain the decline of populations following fragmentation, it appears that horned lizards are disappearing from habitat remnants in southern California at least in part due to the deterministic effects of a biological invasion.",

    "abstract": "*[We investigated the indirect effects of Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, invasions on coastal horned lizards, Phrynosoma coronatum, through an examination of prey selection in the field & laboratory.  In non-invaded areas, coastal horned lizard diet consists predominately of ants (more-than 94% by prey item in 3 reserves examined), particularly Pogonomyrmex & Messor harvester ants.  In invaded areas, most native ants were displaced, & remaining horned lizards incorporated more non-ant arthropods & smaller ants into their diet.  Argentine ants were never detected in horned lizard fecal pellets, suggesting that they are not a suitable replacement food source for the native species they are displacing.  Analysis of prey selection in uninvaded areas reveals that ant species consumption by adult lizards is correlated with ant body size rather than ant abundance, foraging behavior, or defensive method.  Differences in diet between adult and juvenile lizards suggest that a diversity of ant species is necessary to support both age classes.  Laboratory experiments, consisting of paired presentations of 4 native ant species & the Argentine ant, confirmed patterns found in the field.  Both adult & juvenile horned lizards preferred native ants to Argentine ants.  Patterns of preference suggest that, in addition to L. humile's small size, other factors may contribute to the horned lizard's aversion to this species.  Populations of coastal horned lizards have undergone severe declines in recent years.  While habitat loss has been the primary concern, the invasion of Argentine ants into their remaining suitable habitat needs to be monitored to detect their direct & indirect effects on coastal horned lizards.]",

    "abstract": "Brain investment is evolutionarily constrained by high costs of neural tissue. Several ecological factors favour the evolution of increased brain investment; we predict reduced brain region investment will accompany the evolution of organismal or social parasitism when parasites rely on host behaviour and cognition to solve ecological problems. To test this idea we investigated whether brain region investments differed between obligate slave-making Polyergus mexicanus ant workers and their Formica fusca slave workers. Polyergus workers perform little labour for their colonies; enslaved workers of Formica host species forage, excavate nests and tend the brood. We focused on the calyces of the mushroom bodies, central processing brain regions that are larger in social insect workers that perform complex tasks. As predicted we found lower relative investment in mushroom body calyx in P.\tmexicanus workers than in F.\tfusca workers; by contrast, enslaved and free F.\tfusca workers did not differ in mushroom body calyx volume. We then tested whether slave-makers and hosts differed in brain investment among sensory modalities. Polyergus slave-makers employ several unique classes of pheromones during raids, and eye size relative to head size was smaller in P.\tmexicanus workers than in F.\tfusca workers. The size of antennal brain tissues relative to visual tissues was greater in Polyergus, both in the peripheral sensory lobes and in the mushroom body calyx, suggesting greater relative investment in antennal processing by slave-makers. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 113, 415-422",

The behavioral relationships among introduced Argentine ant populations at within-country or within-continent scales have been studied previously, but the behavioral relationships among intercontinental populations have not been examined. The present study investigated the levels of aggression among intercontinental Argentine ant populations by transporting live ants from Europe and California to Japan and conducting aggression tests against Japanese populations. Workers from the dominant supercolonies of Europe and California did not show aggressive behavior toward workers from the dominant supercolony of Japan, whereas they fought vigorously against workers from minor supercolonies. The three massive supercolonies, together with Argentine ants from Macaronesia, may be the largest non-aggressive unit formed by a social insect species in which intraspecific aggression exists. Absence or low levels of aggression at transcontinental scale, which may have derived from low genetic variation, may help introduced Argentine ants maintain expansive supercolonies. The lack of aggression implies possible frequent exchanges of individuals among the intercontinental populations mediated by human activities.",

    "abstract": "The paucity of empirical data on processes in species life cycles demands tools to extract insight from field observations. Such insights help inform policy on invasive species and on impacts of climate change at regional and local scales. We used the CLIMEX model to infer the response of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), to temperature and moisture from its range in the United States. We tested hypotheses on the mechanisms that limit the distribution of the ant and estimated the potential global area at risk from invasion. The ant can spread further in the United States, including north along the west coast, where patterns of infestation will differ from those in the east. We analyzed the risk of colonization in Australia and New Zealand, where the ant was recently discovered. The patterns of infestation of the ant in Oceania will differ from those in the eastern United States, with slower growth and less winter mortality. This study adds to earlier temperature-based models by incorporating a moisture response; by replacing arbitrary categories of colony size to predict overwintering success with a site-specific model based on the balance between annual growth and survival; and by comparing different hypotheses on low temperature-related mechanisms that limit the geographical distribution. It shows how the response of a species to climate can be synthesized from field observations to provide useful insights into its population dynamics. Such analyses provide a basis for making decisions on regional management of invasive species and an informative context for local studies.",

Liquid bait is a safe and effective alternative, but it requires bait stations to dispense the toxicant. We developed a biodegradable hydrogel to deliver liquid bait obviating the need for bait stations. RESULTS: Alginate hydrogel beads with preferred rigidity and maximum hydration in 25% sucrose solution were engineered by optimizing a crosslinking process. The moisture content of the substrate on which the beads were placed and the relative atmospheric humidity significantly influenced water loss dynamics of the hydrated hydrogel beads. Laboratory choice studies indicated that hydrated hydrogel beads had reduced palatability to foraging ants when they lost e50% water. An enzyme\u0010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that the insecticide thiamethoxam added to sucrose solution was absorbed into the hydrogel beads. Hydrogel beads conditioned in sucrose solution with 1\tmg L-π thiamethoxam provided complete control of all castes of Argentine ant Linepithema humile (Mayr) colony by 14\tdays post treatment in the laboratory trial and provided a 79% reduction in ant activity after 8\tweeks in the field trial. CONCLUSION: Alginate hydrogel beads provided an effective delivery system for liquid baits laced with low concentrations of insecticide to control Argentine ants. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",

    "abstract": "Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is an invasive citrus pest in southern California, which secretes honeydew and has the potential to spread a lethal bacterial disease, huanglongbing, of citrus. In urban citrus, Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), also an invasive pest, tends honeydew-producing hemipterans. We used field data to determine whether the mutualistic relationship between L. humile and six established species of honeydew producers may hinder or favor the establishment of D. citri and its biological control with Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) in citrus via competition or mutualism for ants, respectively. In the field, L. humile and D. citri are engaged in a mutualistic relationship. Ants harvest solid honeydew secreted by psyllid nymphs and tended more than 55% of observed D. citri colonies. Linepithema humile displayed a preference hierarchy when tending honeydew producers infesting citrus. It responded equally or less intensively to D. citri than to other honeydew-producing species. Consequently, the mutualism between L. humile and D. citri was affected by the presence of other honeydew-producing species, and the percentage of D. citri colonies tended by L. humile. The number of ants per D. citri colony also decreased as the number of other honeydew producers increased. Diaphorina citri density was also affected by the presence of other honeydew producers. Both colony size and the number of D. citri nymphs counted per tree decreased as the number of other honeydew producers increased. Our results indicate that competition between honeydew producers for the mutualist ant L. humile may hinder the establishment of D. citri by possibly facilitating increased biological control.",

Despite this, the evidence base has never been holistically synthesised to quantify whether and to what degree non\u0010native ants impact native species diversity. In this study, we performed a meta\u0010analysis of the effects of ant invasion on animal communities. We extracted data from 46 published articles investigating abundance (156 effect sizes) and richness (53 effect sizes) responses of animal taxa to ant invasion in locations relatively unimpacted by other stressors (e.g. human disturbance, other non\u0010native species) to help isolate the effects of invasion. Overall, local animal diversity declined severely, with species abundance and richness lower by 42.79% and 53.56%, respectively, in areas with non\u0010native ants compared with intact uninvaded sites. We then combined responses of individual animal taxa extracted from an article into a single response to represent the \u0018community\u0019 abundance (40 effect sizes) or richness (28 effect sizes) response to non\u0010native ants represented in each article. Local communities decreased substantially in total abundance (52.67%) and species richness (53.47%) in invaded sites. These results highlight non\u0010native ants as the drivers, rather than passengers, of large net\u0010negative reductions to animal community diversity in relatively undisturbed systems around the world, approximately halving local species abundance and richness in invaded areas. Improved international prevention processes, early detection systems harnessing emerging technologies, and well\u0010designed control measures deployable by conservation practitioners are urgently needed if these effects are to be mitigated, prevented or reversed.",

Synchronous changes in nestmate recognition systems occur seasonally in some species of ants, however the mechanisms underlying these seasonal changes are often unknown. We studied two mechanisms, relative brood number and food availability, to determine if they generate temporal variation in intraspecific aggression in an introduced population of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile. Using data from previous studies we found that seasonal increases in aggression levels correlate with seasonal increases in brood-to-worker ratios in the field. However, when we manipulated brood-to-worker ratios in paired experimental colonies, we found no direct evidence that relative brood numbers influenced aggression levels. To determine if food availability influenced aggression we conducted a second experiment in which we randomly assigned pairs of experimental colonies to starved or fed treatments and then measured aggression levels weekly for five weeks. We observed no difference in the level of aggression between these two treatment groups indicating that food availability also has no affect on aggression levels between hostile conspecific colonies.",

    "abstract": "Some species of ants possess an unusual form of social organization in which aggression among nests is absent. This type of social organization, called unicoloniality, has been studied in only a handful of species and its evolutionary origins remain unclear. To date, no study has examined behavioral and genetic patterns at points of contact between the massive supercolonies that characterize unicoloniality. Since interactions at territory boundaries influence the costs of aggression and the likelihood of gene flow, such data may illuminate how supercolonies are formed and maintained. Here we provide field data on intraspecific territoriality for a widespread and invasive unicolonial social insect, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We observed abrupt and well-defined behavioral boundaries at 16 contact zones between three different pairs of supercolonies. We visited nine of these zones weekly during a six-month period and observed consistent and intense intercolony aggression that resulted in variable, but often large, levels of worker mortality. Microsatellite variation along six transects across territory borders showed that FST values were lower within supercolonies (0.08 +- 0.01 (mean +- SE)) than between supercolonies (0.29 +- 0.01) and that this disparity was especially strong right at territory borders, despite direct and prolonged contact between the supercolonies. Matrix correspondence tests confirmed that levels of aggression and genetic differentiation were significantly correlated, but no relationship existed between geographic distance and either intraspecific aggression or genetic differentiation. Patterns of FST variation indicated high levels of gene flow within supercolonies, but little to no gene flow between them. Overall, these findings are inconsistent with a model of relaxed ecological constraints leading to colony fusion and suggest that environmentally derived cues are not the prime determined of nestmate recognition in field populations of Argentine ants.",

    "abstract": "Complex recognition systems underlie the social organization of many organisms. In social insects the acceptance of other individuals as nestmates can involve a variety of different cues, but the relative importance of these cues can change in relation to the fitness costs of accepting or rejecting other individuals. In this study we investigate the mechanisms that underlie recognition behavior in Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). Introduced populations of Argentine ants are characterized by a social structure known as unicoloniality where intraspecific aggression is absent over large distances resulting in the formation of expansive supercolonies. Recent research has identified sites where multiple, mutually aggressive supercolonies co-occur allowing an examination of Argentine ant behavior at territorial boundaries. We found that workers from different supercolonies always interact aggressively with one another, but that neighbors from different colonies (i.e., workers from nests located in the immediate vicinity of territory borders) consistently exhibited higher levels of aggression compared to those displayed by non-neighbors from different colonies (i.e., workers from nests located far enough away from a territory border so that interactions are unlikely). This difference in the level of aggression displayed between neighbours and between non-neighbors from different supercolonies cannot be explained by differences in relatedness or genetic similarity. Instead our findings suggest that direct contact between mutually antagonistic colonies is sufficient to elevate aggression. A laboratory experiment in which we manipulated the extent, to which colonies with no prior history of contact could interact with one another, revealed that aggression increased after colonies were permitted to interact, but dropped after connections between colonies were severed.  Moreover, the mere presence of an aggressive supercolony was sufficient to elicit elevated aggression. Overall these patterns are opposite to the \"dear enemy\" phenomenon and could be the result of the intense territorial aggression exhibited by established supercolonies of this species.",

Moreover, in the field, aggression between workers collected from colony borders was symmetrical, whereas polarized aggression occurred between workers collected 500-m away from colony borders.  Coinciding with this shift in aggression symmetry, we also observed an increase in both the overall level of aggression and the frequency of aggression inboth the field and laboratory bioassays.  We found little evidence for colony-level competitive asymmetries stemming from polarities in aggression at the worker level, either in the laboratory or in the field.  These results illustrate that recognition systems in Argentine ants are surprisingly dynamic and provide experimental evidence for how recognition can be adjusted in response to specific circumstances, in this case the presence of intraspecific competitors.]",

    "abstract": "1.The dispersal capabilities of most plant species remain unknown. However, gaining basic dispersal information is a critical step for understanding species' geographical distributions and for predicting the likely impacts of future climate change. Dispersal mechanisms can indicate short- or long-distance dispersers, and highlight important biological interactions. 2.To predict dispersal mechanisms for species where information is limited, we used generalized linear mixed models with basic life-history and ecological traits. Sets of models were created (using Australian species) for six dispersal categories: wind, unassisted, water, ant, vertebrate-ingestion and vertebrate-attachment dispersal mechanisms. We validated our models on the dispersal mechanisms of 50 Australian, 30 Californian, 30 Swiss plant species and a global compilation of 70 species. 3.Growth form, seed mass and vegetation type were the main predictor variables. Our models predicted dispersal mechanisms for Australian and Californian plant species equally well (c. 70% correct) and to a lesser extent for the Swiss flora (c. 50% correct). Our models predicted observed dispersal mechanisms (c. 50% correct) equally well to inferred dispersal mechanisms (based on seed morphology). 4.Synthesis. Our approach of using easily obtainable traits for predicting dispersal mechanisms of species allows dispersal information to be predicted for species where little is known. From here, the application of realistic dispersal curves to the predicted dispersal mechanisms will further understanding on the dispersal capabilities of species.",

    "abstract": "Although the ecological effects of invasions often become obvious soon after introduced species become established, more gradual effects may take years to manifest and can thus require long-term data for quantification. We analyzed an 8-year record of stable isotope data on Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) from southern California to infer how the trophic position of this widespread invasive species changes over time as native ant species are displaced. We couple this longitudinal analysis with a biregional comparison of stable isotope data (delta15N) on ants from Argentina (native range) and California (introduced range) to quantify (i) how the trophic position of L. humile differs between native and introduced populations, and (ii) how relative trophic position as estimated by delta15N values of Argentine ants compare with those of other ants at the same site. Both long-term and bioregional comparisons indicate that the Argentine ant's relative trophic position is reduced at sites with a longer history of occupation. Over the course of 8 years, the relative trophic position of L. humile remained high at the leading edge of an invasion front but declined, on average, behind the front as native ants disappeared.  Relative to native populations, where L. humile is among the most carnivorous of ants, Argentine ants from California occupied lower trophic positions. These results support the hypothesis that Argentine ants shift their diet after establishment as a result of resource depletion and increasing reliance on plant-based resources, especially honeydew-producing Hemiptera. Our results demonstrate the value of long-term and biregional data in uncovering ecological effects of invasions.",

Stable isotope analysis is a promising method for determining the dietary history of an organism, and has the potential to advance our understanding of the food web ecology of social insects. However, some unique characteristics of eusocial organisms can complicate the application of this technique to the study of their trophic ecology. Using stable isotopes of N and C, we investigated levels of intraspecific variation both within and among colonies.

I also identify the role past climatic fluctuations have had in shaping this species' current distribution.  In chapter one, I conducted a RNA-seq analysis to identify stress-induced genes in P. imparis individuals at the transcriptome level.  To identify candidate genes involved in the stress response, I induced stress by placing the ants at a low or high temperature.  I identified a total of 709 differentially expressed genes.  In the cold-stressed ants, I did not identify a strong response, indicating that the temperature we chose for trials was not cold enough.  Conversely, I found a strong response to the heat.  We found highly-induced include protein folding genes, heat shock proteins, proteins associated with heat shock proteins, Ca2+ ion transport, & a few unknown genes.  I also found functional categories relating to protein folding, muscles, & temperature stimulus increased in the heat-stress response.  In chapter 2, I measured the short-term acclimation ability of high-elevation & low-elevation populations of P. imparis across California.  In addition, I also characterized the thermal environment both above & below ground.  I found that the high-elevation sites showed increased tolerance & reduced capacity in acclimation ability relative to the low-elevation counterparts at their lower limits, suggesting an evolutionary trade-off between tolerance & acclimation ability.  I found less acclimation capacity across all populations in their upper limits.  I also found that the high-elevation sites experience cooler temperatures both above & below ground.  In chapter 3, I used phylogenetic & population genetic analyses to identify population genetic structure & historical demographic patterns across the range of P. imparis.  I relate the genomic patterns to those expected as seen with in situ diversification, or maintained connectivity.  I found 5 well-supported genetically isolated clades across the distribution.  I investigated gene flow between these major genetic clades, but did not find evidence of gene flow between clades.  High support for 5 major geographic lineages & lack of evidence of contemporary gene flow indicate in situ diversification across the species' range, probably influenced by glacial cycles of the late Quaternary.]          *[We sequenced 73 individual ants collected from sites across the United States & Mexico.

Here, we report the results of a continental\u0010scale phylogenomic analysis across the entire range of a widespread species. We analysed sequences of 1402 orthologous ultraconserved element (UCE) loci from 75 individuals to identify population genetic structure and historical demographic patterns across the continent\u0010wide range of a cold\u0010adapted ant, the winter ant, Prenolepis imparis. We recovered five well\u0010supported, genetically isolated clades representing lineages that diverged from 8.2\u00132.2 million years ago. These include: (i) an early diverging lineage located in Florida, (ii) a lineage that spans the southern United States, (iii) populations that extend across the midwestern and northeastern United States, (iv) populations from the western United States and (v) populations in southwestern Arizona and Mexico. Population genetic analyses revealed little or no gene flow among these lineages, but patterns consistent with more recent gene flow among populations within lineages, and localized structure with migration in the western United States. High support for five major geographical lineages and lack of evidence of contemporary gene flow indicate in situ diversification across the species' range, producing relatively ancient lineages that persisted through subsequent climate change and glaciation during the Quaternary.          *[In Supplementary Table 1.

Conversely, we found a strong response to heat: 426 upregulated genes & 210 downregulated genes.  Of these, 10 were expressed at a greater than 10-fold change relative to the control.  The transcripts we could identify included those encoding for protein folding genes, heat shock proteins, histones, & Ca2+ ion transport.  One of these transcripts, hsc70-4L was found to be under positive selection.  We also characterized the functional categories of differentially expressed genes.]",

In addition, we measured the short-term acclimation ability & thermal tolerance of those populations.  To measure thermal tolerance, we used chill-coma recovery time & knockdown time as indicators of cold & heat tolerance, respectively.  Short-term phenotypic plasticity was assessed by calculating acclimation capacity using chill-coma recovery time & knockdown time after exposure to both high & low temperatures.  We found that several populations displayed different chill-coma recovery times & a few displayed different heat knockdown times, & that the acclimation capacities of cold & heat tolerance differed among most populations.  The high-elevation populations displayed increased tolerance to the cold (faster chill-coma recovery time) & greater plasticity.  For high-temperature tolerance, we found heat tolerance was not associated with altitude, but greater tolerance to the heat was correlated with increased plasticity at higher temperatures.]",

    "abstract": "*[In the first chapter, I investigate how enslavement by Polyergus breviceps affects the nestmate recognitions system of its host, Formica altipetens.  I compared the chemical, genetic, & behavioral characteristics of enslaved & free-living Formica colonies.  I found that enslaved Formica colonies were both more genetically & chemically diverse than their free-living counterparts.  Enslaved Formica workers were also less aggressive towards non-nestmates compared to free-living Formica.  These results suggest that parasitism by Polyergus dramatically alters both the chemical & genetic context in which their kidnapped hosts develop, such that it may affect how they recognize nestmates.  In the second chapter, I study how the presence of multiple host species in sympatry shapes the chemical & genetic structure of a single population of Polyergus breviceps.  To successfully adapt to a particular host, slave-making ants may mimic or camouflage themselves with the species-specific chemical cues, that their slaves use to recognize & accept nestmates.  If such host specialization should continue through several generations, genetic structuring according to host may occur.  I collected both chemical & genetic data from Polyergus colonies from the same location parasitizing 3 species of Formica.  I concluded that the Polyergus from this location can be distinguished chemically according to host species & there is sufficient genetic evidence from both maternally & biparentally inherited markers to propose that host-races have formed in this species of slave-maker.  The third chapter examines the phylogeography & population structure of 2 currently recognized species of North American Polyergus (P. breviceps & P. lucidus) & the hosts that they enslave (Formica spp).  I used sequence from one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome oxidase I) & 3 nuclear genes (28S, elongation factor 1-alpha, arginine kinase) to reconstruct the ancestor-descendent relationships between several populations of Polyergus & the different species of Formica they enslave.  Additionally, I subjected the DNA sequence data to a Bayesian method of species delimitation to explore North American Polyergus species boundaries.  Lastly, I use the mitochondrial DNA sequence data to consider the relative effects of geography & host species on the population genetic structure of P. breviceps & P. lucidus.  On the whole, North American Polyergus populations generally follow a broad west-east phylogeographic pattern, & can be divided into 3 distinct species: P. breviceps as 2 species & P. lucidus as it is currently recognized.  Although population structuring of P. breviceps can be primarily explained by geography & to some extent host species, P. lucidus population structure is more strongly dictated by host association & not by geographic distribution.]          *[Formica neorufibarbis misspelled Formica neorufibarbous.]",

    "abstract": "Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in their native South American range, like most other ant species, form spatially restricted colonies that display high levels of aggression toward other such colonies. In their introduced range, Argentine ants are unicolonial and form massive supercolonies composed of numerous nests among which territorial boundaries are absent. Here we examine the role of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in nestmate recognition of this highly damaging invasive ant using three supercolonies from its introduced range.  We conducted behavioral assays to test the response of Argentine ants to workers treated with colonymate or non-colonymate CHCs. Additionally, we quantified the amount of hydrocarbons transferred to individual ants and performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to qualitatively characterize our manipulation of CHC profiles. The GC/MS data revealed marked differences in the hydrocarbon profiles across supercolonies and indicated that our treatment effectively masked the original chemical profile of the treated ants with the profile belonging to the foreign individuals. We found that individual workers treated with foreign CHCs were aggressively rejected by their colonymates and this behavior appears to be concentration-dependent: larger quantities of foreign CHCs triggered higher levels of aggression. Moreover, this response was not simply due to an increase in the amount of CHCs applied to the cuticle since treatment with high concentrations of nestmate CHCs did not trigger aggression.The results of this study bolster the findings of previous studies on social insects that have implicated CHCs as nestmate recognition cues and provide insight into the mechanisms of nestmate recognition in the invasive Argentine ant.",

Although the immediate energetic cost for 2 ants to interact is insignificant, the downstream effects of receiving & integrating social information can have metabolic consequences.

    "abstract": "*[Populations of the desert seed-harvesting ant Pheidole xerophylla are often characterized by high nest density leading to competitive interactions between foragers from different nests. We investigated the inter-nest aggression, spatial distribution and genetic structure of a P. xerophylla population of the Mojave Desert in Southern California. Inter-nest aggression was quantified by standardized staged encounters in a neutral arena. Genetic relatedness within nests and relatedness between nests were calculated using allelic frequencies at four microsatellite-DNA loci. We found a bimodal distribution of inter-colony aggression levels with a first mode at low aggression levels and another mode at much higher aggression levels. Inter-colony aggression levels were largely non-transitive. No effect of geographical distance on inter-nest aggression levels was detected. Despite high amounts of variation in inter-colony relatedness (- 0.24 to 0.37) this variable did not correlate with the level of aggression between nests. Intra-nest relatedness ranged from 0.40 to 0.75 and close inspection of worker genotypes within colonies revealed a high proportion of polygynous colonies or a mixture of polygyny and polyandry. Aggression levels among nests was found to decrease with increasing intra-nest relatedness. These results do not support the idea that aggression is modulated by a nestmate recognition mechanism based on overall genetic similarity. Instead, the absence of transitivity found in inter-colony aggression and bimodal distribution of aggression levels are compatible with a common label acceptance model of nestmate recognition and suggest that label diversity may be encoded by a limited number of loci.]",

    "abstract": "Many animals, from birds to insects, build structures using wood, soil, or a range other materials. Suprisingly to most people, a similarly diverse array of animal homes exist underground, in the hiddent world beneath our feet. This is particularly true for ants who excavate large and complex nests in which they shelter, reproduce and generally go about their lives. Despite the existence of this vast underground world, it has remained largely unexplored. Walter Tschinkel, however, has spent his career researching underground ant nests in his home state of Florida (where they are particularly prevalent) and this book is his story of discovery about what he has learned about these nests and they reveal about ant biology and behavior more broadly. Tschinkel starts the book by describing just how he studies ants nest - an arduous excavation process which involves first filling the nests with plaster, molten metal or wax. But this is a book driven by fascinating questions and the experiments the author has devised to try and answer them. How does nest architecture vary across ant species? How are new nests excavated during colony relocation? Are the ants organized within the nest? Do ants have \"architectural plans?\" What is the effect of all this nest excavation on soils? And how does the division of labor within the nest work? Ultimately, Tschinkel provides answers to many of these questions, but also acknowledges what mysteries, including why nests evolved in the first place, still remain. In telling this story, Tschinkel introduces readers to the surprising beauty and architectural complexity of underground ant nests and to how scientific research on them is done.",

In contrast, the observed patterns of mtDNA variation & wLonF infections suggest frequent horizontal transfer &  losses of wLonF infections.

The precision of discrimination, in turn, relies on variation in the labels that individuals use to recognize group members. However this same variation can be selected against if individuals that are rejected as nonmembers incur a high cost. Here we provide evidence that selection against individuals from genetically diverse groups has contributed to the formation of the unicolonial colony structure that characterizes introduced populations of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Studies in both the laboratory and the field showed that individuals from less genetically diverse colonies attack individuals from more diverse colonies and that attackers survived agonistic encounters more than six times as often as recipients of aggression. This selection, in concert with reductions in genetic diversity after a founder event, likely creates a barrier to the establishment of new, genetically diverse introductions from the native range and may reduce genetic diversity within established populations in the introduced range.",

This confirmed that populations in Brazil, previously identified as L. humile, are likely a different species.  The microsatellite-based analysis provided resolution among native & introduced populations of L. humile that could not be resolved using the mitochondrial sequences.  In the native range, colonies that were geographically close to one another tended to be genetically similar, whereas more distant colonies were genetically different.  Most samples from the introduced range were genetically similar, although some exceptions were noted.  Most introduced populations were similar to native populations from the southern Rio Parana & were particularly similar to a population from Rosario, Argentina.

We examined the response of ants to these disturbances in grasslands in northern California. Twenty-four 30 by 30 m plots were established across two sites that received one of four treatments: grazing, fire, grazing and fire, or no treatment. Ants were censused using 240 pitfall traps with one preburn and two postburn samples (14 d and 1 yr after burning). We analyzed ant abundance using broadly defined groups based on feeding habit and/or habitat use and detected no grazing effect but a significant fire effect that differed by group. Immediate postfire sampling showed an increase in cryptic species (particularly Brachymyrmex depilis). One year after the fire, no response was detected for cryptic species, but burned plots had greater abundance of seed harvesters. Analysis of vegetation showed burned plots had significantly greater forb cover, which might have provided greater food resources, and also lower biomass, which might have facilitated foraging. Understanding the effects of these management tools on ant abundance complements our understanding of their effect on vegetation and assists conservation practitioners effectively manage grassland ecosystems both in California and beyond.",

However, despite an abundance of studies on ant responses to both environmental disturbance & land management techniques, an analysis of the practice & value of including ants in monitoring is lacking.  Consequently, conservation managers are left with little guidance as to if, when, & how ants can be used to assess conservation activities.  Based on our review of approximately 60 published studies, we outline 5 areas where ants provide valuable information for management-based monitoring: to detect the presence of invasive species, to detect trends among threatened or endangered species, to detect trends among keystone species, to evaluate land management actions, & to assess long-term ecosystem changes.  We also discuss practical considerations when designing a monitoring framework for ants, including appropriate methods, taxonomic resolution for sampling, & spatial and temporal scale.  We find that when integrated with management goals, monitoring ants can provide information over the short-term on topics such as the status of invasive or keystone species, as well as over longer time frames, for instance the impact of climate change.  Overall, we conclude that ants merit monitoring based on their inherent ecological qualities, independent of any indicator attributes they might have.]",

    "abstract": "Conservation managers of oak woodlands have been reintroducing fire both as an ecological process per se and to assist in restoring native plant communities. To increase our understanding of the impacts of reintroduced fire on ground-dwelling invertebrates we examined the response of ants and spiders to a late season (autumn) prescribed fire conducted in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland ecosystem in northern California. Twelve 100 m X 100 m plots were established, six plots received a burn treatment and the remaining six plots were unburned controls. Ants and spiders were sampled using pitfall traps left open continuously and collected approximately every 32 days. Sampling was conducted over a year, consisting of four pre-burn and nine post-burn collections. Abundance was analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA, which showed seed-harvester ants decreased significantly in the two months following the fire. Total spider abundance also showed a significant decrease in two months, although this did not occur immediately after the burn. One spider hunting guild, the 'diurnal ambush' group (Thomisidae) remained suppressed for up to nine months. Correspondence analysis measures of ant species abundance with environmental and vegetation variables (percent rock, bare ground, plant species richness and height of herbaceous vegetation) were higher than expected by chance, which assists in explaining some of the responses. Findings from this study revealed that the reintroduction of autumn burns has modest and short-term effect on the invertebrates sampled, suggesting that late season fires are compatible with other conservation goals for oak woodland ecosystems.",

A brief overview of the parasites and pathogens of S. invicta will be presented with emphasis on the biology of three viruses discovered recently from Solenopsis invicta using a metagenomics approach. All of the viruses possess a single-stranded RNA genome, but each possesses a unique genome sequence, structure, and architecture. Two of the viruses appear to cause persistent, asymptomatic infections in the ant host, while the third is highly virulent, resulting in significant colony mortality. Heterologous expression is being employed to mass produce the virulent virus for development as a microbial control agent.

In sampled locations where S. invicta and S. geminata are sympatric (specifically, Gainesville, FL and Travis, TX), SINV-1 was detected in S. geminata. Conversely, in areas in which S. geminata and S. invicta are allopatric, SINV-1 was not detected in S. geminata; these locations included north Australia (n = 12), southern Mexico (n = 107), Hawaii (n = 48), Taiwan (n = 12), and the Johnston Atoll (n = 6). A similar relationship was observed for S. richteri. In areas in which S. invicta and S. richteri were sympatric, SINV-1 was detected in the S. richteri population, but in areas in which S. invicta and S. richteri were allopatric, SINV-1 was not detected. These occurrences suggest that S. invicta is the host of predilection, or preferred host for SINV-1, and that the congenerics, S. geminata and S. richteri serve as either accidental, reservoir, or transfer hosts. The minus genome strand of SINV-1 was detected in S. geminata and S. richteri indicating that these species may serve as functional hosts capable of supporting SINV-1 replication. SINV-1 was not detected in S. xyloni regardless of its proximity to S. invicta. These results suggest that SINV-1 may be an example of pathogen spillover or pollution.

Two genotypes examined, SINV-1 and -1A, exhibited similar seasonal prevalence patterns. Infection rates among colonies of S. invicta in Gainesville, Florida, were lowest from early winter (December) to early spring (April) increasing rapidly in late spring (May) and remaining high through August before declining again in the fall (September/October). Correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between mean monthly temperature and SINV-1 (p<0.0005, r=0.82) and SINV-1A (p<0.0001, r=0.86) infection rates in S. invicta colonies. SINV-1 was widely distributed among S. invicta populations. The virus was detected in S. invicta from Argentina and from all U.S. states examined, with the exception of New Mexico. SINV-1 and -1A were also detected in other Solenopsis species. SINV-1 was detected in Solenopsis richteri and the S. invicta/richteri hybrid collected from northern Alabama and Solenopsis geminata from Florida. SINV-1A was detected in S. geminata and Solenopsis carolinensis in Florida and the S. invicta/richteri hybrid in Alabama. Of the 1989 arthropods collected from 6 pitfall trap experiments from Gainesville and Williston, Florida, none except S. invicta tested positive for SINV-1 or SINV-1A. SINV-1 did not appear to infect or replicate within Sf9 or Dm-2 cells in vitro.

    "abstract": "The New World ant genus Myrmecocystus Wesmael, 1838 (Formicidae: Formicinae: Lasiini) is endemic to arid and semi-arid habitats of the western United States and Mexico. Several intriguing life history traits have been described for the genus, the best-known of which are replete workers, that store liquified food in their largely expanded crops and are colloquially referred to as \u001choneypots\u001d. Despite their interesting biology and ecological importance for arid ecosystems, the evolutionary history of Myrmecocystus ants is largely unknown and the current taxonomy presents an unsatisfactory systematic framework. We use ultraconserved elements to infer the evolutionary history of Myrmecocystus ants and provide a comprehensive, dated phylogenetic framework that clarifies the molecular systematics within the genus with high statistical support, reveals cryptic diversity, and reconstructs ancestral foraging activity. Using maximum likelihood, Bayesian and species tree approaches on a data set of 134 ingroup specimens (including samples from natural history collections and type material), we recover largely identical topologies that leave the position of only few clades uncertain and cover the intra- and interspecific variation of 28 of the 29 described and six undescribed species. In addition to traditional support values, such as bootstrap and posterior probability, we quantify genealogical concordance to estimate the effects of conflicting evolutionary histories on phylogenetic inference. Our analyses reveal that the current taxonomic classification of the genus is inconsistent with the molecular phylogenetic inference, and we identify cryptic diversity in seven species. Divergence dating suggests that the split between Myrmecocystus and its sister taxon Lasius occurred in the early Miocene. Crown group Myrmecocystus started diversifying about 14.08 Ma ago when the gradual aridification of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico led to formation of the American deserts and to adaptive radiations of many desert taxa.          *[Non Myrmecocystus species used as outgroups; ]",

    "abstract": "Almond and pistachio acreage in California has increased substantially from 2000 to 2014. Almond acreage has increased over 72% to 350,000 ha while pistachio acreage increased over 195% to 89,000 ha. At the same time, insecticide/miticide usage has increased over 300% to 4.7 applications per bearing ha in almonds and over 350% to 7.0 applications per bearing ha in pistachios. The key insect pest of almonds and pistachios is navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella, and this pest drives pest management practices. There are a large number of other damaging pests of pistachios and almonds. In pistachios, the true bug complex, which is composed of stink bugs (green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare, Uhler stink bug, Chlorochroa uhleri and redshouldered stink bug, Thyanta pallidovirens), leaffooted bugs (Leptoglossus clypealis, L. occidentalis and L. zonatus), and small plant bugs (Western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, California buckeye bug, Neuroclopus longirostris, calocoris bug, Calocoris norvegicus, Phytocoris bug, Phytocoris spp.) can cause significant damage. In almonds, along with the true bug complex above, other damaging pests include peach twig borer, Anarsia linetella, oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta, and ants (pavement ant, Tetramorim caespitum, southern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni and thief ant, S. molesta). In almonds, control of these pests suppresses the beneficial arthropod complex, which can result in damaging Pacific spider mite and two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus pacificus and T. urticae) populations. The driving forces for this significant increase in acreage and insecticide/miticide usage is the result of a number of factors, which include government regulation, market forces, insecticide resistance and annual insect/mite population pressures. These driving forces will be discussed below with their impact on pest management.",

An encounter with a non-colony mate also increased the probability that a worker would attack ants from a colony that it had not previously encountered.

Our results show that tri-methyl alkanes are more easily learned than single-methyl or straight-chain alkanes. In addition, we reveal that Argentine ants can discriminate between hydrocarbons with different branching patterns and the same chain length, but not always between hydrocarbons with the same branching patterns but different chain length. Our data thus show that biochemical characteristics influence those compounds that ants can discriminate between, and which thus potentially play a role in chemical signalling and nest-mate recognition.",

    "abstract": "Fire ants, Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri, were inadvertently introduced into the United States in the early 1900s and currently inhabit over 129 million hectares in Puerto Rico and twelve southern states from Texas to Virginia. Imported fire ants have also become established in isolated sites in California, New Mexico, and Maryland. They are expected to move upward along the Pacific coast, southward into Mexico and the Caribbean, and northward in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and along the eastern seaboard into Maryland and possibly Delaware. Within the past 10 years populations of S. invicta have been found in Australia, Taiwan, and mainland China. Fire ant population densities in the United States are very high. Workers are aggressive and have a potent sting and they have a high reproductive potential. The medical, agricultural, and other costs of fire ant control and damage in the United States are estimated at nearly six billion dollars per year.  Mature monogyne (single queen) fire ant colonies contain 100,000 to 250,000 workers and reach infestation rates of over 130 mounds per hectare. In the last several decades, polygyne fire ant colonies (multi-queen colonies) appear to be proliferating in the southern United States, with mound densities up to 500 per hectare. Monogyne S. invicta colony workers are territorial and aggressive toward members of other fire ant colonies. In contrast, polygyne colony workers are not aggressive toward non-nestmates, presumably due to broader exposure to heritable and environmentally derived nestmate recognition cues (broad template). The nestmate recognition system for the two social forms is very complex, and may by correlated with a single gene, Gp-9, especially for acceptance or rejection of newly mated queens. Workers from both monogyne and polygyne fire ant colonies execute newly mated queens after mating flights. We discovered that after removal of their colony queen, monogyne worker aggression toward non-nestmate conspecifics quickly drops to investigative levels; however, heterospecific recognition/aggression remains high. Queenless monogyne or polygyne worker groups were also not aggressive toward newly mated queens. Queenless worker groups of both forms that adopted a monogyne-derived newly mated queen became aggressive toward non-nestmate workers and newly mated queens. We suggested that this powerful effect of queens on conspecific nestmate recognition is caused by a queen produced recognition primer pheromone that increases the sensitivity of workers to subtle quantitative differences in nestmate recognition cues. Biogenic amines have been reported to modulate the sensitivity of insects to stimuli. We used this information to probe the primer pheromone/endocrine basis of nestmate recognition in fire ants. Queenright colonies were divided into three components: queenright, queenless, and queenless fed the biogenic amine, octopamine (OA). Queenright colonies maintained high aggression levels. In contrast, queenless workers fed only crickets and aqueous sucrose had low aggression levels. Workers that were fed octopamine had aggression levels that were not significantly different from queenright workers. Feeding OA to fire ant workers was adequate to simulate the presence of the queen, in terms of nestmate recognition. Thus, we have strong evidence that the queen recognition primer pheromone acts on workers to maintain high levels of OA that up-modulates worker sensitivity to the subtle changes in intraspecific nestmate recognition cues.

    "abstract": "The fire ants, Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri, were inadvertently introduced into the United States early in the 1900s and currently inhabit over 150 million hectares in Puerto Rico and twelve southern states from Texas to Virginia. Imported fire ants have also become established in isolated sites in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Maryland. The fire ant's large numbers and potent sting have resulted in significant medical, agricultural, and environmental impacts. The population densities in the U.S. are 5-10 times higher than in South America, most likely due to their escape from natural enemies. Recently, biological control agents have become available for introduction into the United States, e.g. phorid fly parasites and a microsporidian pathogen, setting the stage for integrated fire ant management. An areawide fire ant management project proposal was funded by USDA/ARS Headquarters to demonstrate control of fire ant populations over large areas using commercially available insecticide bait and self-sustaining biological control agents. Control and treatment demonstration sites (120ha + periphery) were set up in each of five states (Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina, and Mississippi). The control and treatment sites both had bait (hydramethylnon and methoprene) applications, but only the treatment site had biocontrol agents released around the periphery. After 3.5 years phorid fly parasites have been established at the demonstration sites. The microsporidian pathogen is established in all sites except Mississippi. Fire ant populations have been reduced by 85-99% in the treatment demonstration sites. Environmental assessment has demonstrated that bait toxicants do affect non-target ant species that would otherwise play a role in decreasing fire ant reinfestation rates. Educational outreach activities resulted in informative brochures, the establishment of a program website, videos, and general information on fire ants. The research component has responded with additional biocontrol organisms and better pathogen detection methods.

    "abstract": "Diplochory is seed dispersal by a sequence of two or more steps or phases, each involving a different dispersal agent. Here, we describe five forms of diplochory and derive general characteristics of each phase of seed dispersal. The first and second phases of diplochory offer different benefits to plants. Phase one dispersal often results in escape from density-dependent seed and seedling mortality near the parent plant and can result in the colonization of habitat patches far from the parent. Phase two dispersal often moves seeds to discrete and predictable microsites, where the probability of seedling establishment is disproportionately high (i.e. directed dispersal). Diplochory appears to have evolved because combining two means of seed dispersal can increase the benefits of seed dispersal whilst reducing the likelihood of seed mortality.

No-choice tests showed that P. curvatus hovered over and attacked all three species of fire ants. The mean number of pupae successfully completing development to adult flies in the trials was 5.03  +- 1.55 (mean +- SE) per female fly in S. invicta, 0.66 +- 0.24 per female fly in S. xyloni, and 0 per female fly in S. geminata. Paired preference tests showed that P. curvatus preferred to hover over S. invicta instead of S. xyloni 77 +- 3% (mean +- SE) of the time and preferred S. invicta over S. geminata 87 +- 4% of the time. The oviposition attempts of active female P. curvatus were 2.8 times higher on S. invicta than on S. xyloni and 16 times higher on S. invicta than on S. geminata.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the number of successful establishments of the invasive Argentine ant outside native range and to see whether introduced supercolonies have resulted from single or multiple introductions. We also compared the genetic diversity of native versus introduced supercolonies to assess the size of the propagules (i.e. the number of founding individuals) at the origin of the introduced supercolonies.   Global.   We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers and microsatellite loci to study 39 supercolonies of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile covering both the native (n = 25) and introduced range (n = 14).   Data from three mitochondrial genes and 13 nuclear microsatellites suggest that the introduced supercolonies studied originated from at least seven founding events out of the native area in Argentina (primary introductions). The distribution of mtDNA haplotypes also suggests that supercolonies in the introduced range each derive from a single source supercolony and that one of these source supercolonies has been particularly successful, being the basis of many introduced populations spread across the world. Comparison of the genetic diversity of supercolonies based on the five most diverse loci also revealed that native and introduced supercolonies have greatly overlapping ranges of diversity, although the genetic diversity is on average less in introduced than in native supercolonies.   Both primary introductions (from the native range) and secondary introductions (from sites with established invasive supercolonies) were important in the global expansion of the Argentine ant. In combination with the similar social organization of colonies in the native and introduced range, this indicates that invasiveness did not evolve recently as a unique and historically contingent event (e.g. reduction of genetic diversity) in this species. Rather, native L. humile supercolonies have characteristics that make them pre-adapted to invade new - and in particular disturbed - habitats when given the opportunity. These results have important implications with regard to possible strategies to be used to control invasive ants.",

    "abstract": "Imported fire ants pose two primary threats to humans: the risk of anaphylaxis following stings, and the potential for secondary infection of localized pustules that result from stings. Additionally, fire ant products such as whole-body extract and venom can present risks to laboratory personnel. Whether in concentrated form in the laboratory or retained within the living animal, fire ant venom alkaloids and proteins are biological toxins with potentially severe health effects. Several recommendations are given for minimizing the risk of stings in the laboratory and field with the understanding that most experienced workers are capable of assessing their own tolerance to stings and acting accordingly. Since there are no fail-safe methods for avoiding fire ant stings, all workers who are exposed to imported fire ants should be familiar with the symptoms of anaphylaxis and be prepared to seek immediate medical assistance if they or their co-workers are stung and show symptoms of hypersensitivity.

    "abstract": "Urban habitats are undergoing a faunal and floral homogenization process worldwide. We investigated how such homogenization influences ant communities. We monitored ant species richness and abundance in natural, semi-natural, urban, and agricultural habitats for one year, along an urban-rural gradient in the San Francisco Bay Area, and examined which human-related and other environmental variables most affect ant distribution. We investigated whether alien ant species have an advantage in human-modified habitats. We found that distance from buildings was the most important factor affecting ant distribution. In total, we recorded 17 ant species, of which four were non-native. Native ant species richness was highest in natural habitats, and alien species richness was highest in urban habitats. Remarkably, in a sample of 19,450 ant workers at food baits, the highest ant abundance across all seasons was in the semi-natural habitat where usually only the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), representing 81% of all ants seen at baits, and the native winter ant (Prenolepis imparis) were present. Agricultural habitats had a surprisingly high number of native and alien species. It appears that the invasive Argentine ant creates a favorable ecological community in semi-natural environments, where they compete successfully with the native species, and do not face the increased competition with other alien species that they encounter in urban habitats. Even well protected natural habitat may be favorable for invasive species, due to its proximity to human disturbance.",

On average, 75.5%% of emergent mosquitoes were collected in jars at the apex of 0.25-m≤ emergence traps placed on the water surface. Recently emerged mosquitoes spent ~1 d in emergence traps before moving into the collection jars. Pest control strips (2.54 cm≤ of Vaportape II: 10%% 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate), which have been used in collection jars during previous studies to deter foraging on newly emerged mosquito adults by Argentine ants (Linepithema humile Mayr), did not significantly reduce the number of adult mosquitoes in collection jars and did not delay the movement of adult mosquitoes into collection jars. The cumulative proportion of adult mosquito production sampled by the pyramidal emergence traps increased at a decreasing rate across time (proportion of total production == \u00120.314 + 1.021(1 \u0012 e{{p.≥wpW) where t is days of trapping).

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine the extent to which the introduced argentine ant (Iridomyrmex humilis), a pest in urban and agricultural environments, has invaded natural habitats in the Lower Sacramento Valley, and its effects on the native ant fauna.  Of 4 natural habitats surveyed (valley riparian woodland, foothill riparian woodland, blue oak-digger pine woodland, and chaparral) at 46 sites in Yolo and Solano counties, only valley riparian woodland was found to have been colonized by I. humilis.  Riparian woodland sites occupied by I. humilis have permanent sources of water and tend to be environmentally degraded.  Populations of I. humilis are common but patchily distributed along 4 principal riparian systems in Yolo and Solano counties (Ulatis Creek, Putah Creek, Cache Creek and the Sacramento River).  Observations indicated that patches of semidisturbed riparian woodland provide refuges from which populations of I. humilis may invade adjacent agricultural land, and vice versa.  The species richness of native ants is markedly reduced at riparian woodland sites occupied by I. humilis.  Among the common native ants, epigaeic (above ground foraging) species are more susceptible to displacement by I. humilis than are hypogaeic species.  The 3 most adversely affected species (L. occidentale, T. sessile, and F. occidua [=moki]), which are absent from sites colonized by I. humilis, are dominant epigaeic ants; 2 of the 3 least displaced species (S. diecki and S. californicum) are timid, cryptobiotic ants that forage in soil and leaf litter.",

    "abstract": "The ant Pheidole vaslitii Pergande has remained a taxonomic enigma since its description over a hundred years ago from a series of workers collected in the Sierra San Lazaro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. A reexamination of the apparent type series in the USNM collection reveals that some of the specimens -- including a major worker designated as 'lectotype' by Creighton (1958) -- are not true types and are not conspecific with P. vaslitii. Selection of a new lectotype of P. vaslitii secures its identity as a form closely related to P. hyatti. It differs from 'typical' P. hyatti by the presence of more extensive sculpture on the head of the major and minor workers and by its shorter body appendages, but intermediate phenotypes occur in parts of Baja California and California. Based on current evidence P. hyatti is reasonably interpreted as a single, polytypic species, with both P. vaslitii and an infraspecific name -- P. hyatti solitanea Wheeler, described from Point Loma, California -- as newly recognized junior synonyms.

    "abstract": "Camponotus and Colobopsis are widely distributed and species-rich genera in the ant tribe Camponotini. Molecular phylogenetic studies demonstrate that they are not sister taxa, but several lineages within each genus have converged to a remarkable degree, confounding the taxonomy of these ants. Based on multiple lines of evidence, including worker and male morphology, we demonstrate that: (1) three species of \u001cCamponotus\u001d belonging to the subgenus Myrmotemnus, including its type species, are in fact members of the genus Colobopsis ; (2) four species previously assigned to Colobopsis belong to the subgenus Myrmamblys of Camponotus ; and (3) three Nearctic taxa recently placed in Colobopsis are members of the genus Camponotus and closely related to Camponotus clarithorax . These taxonomic findings yield the following new or revived combinations: Colobopsis moeschi (comb. nov.), Colobopsis moeschi lygaea (comb. nov.), Colobopsis nutans (comb. nov.), Colobopsis nutans cleliae (comb. nov.), and Colobopsis reichenspergeri (comb. nov.); Camponotus apostemata (comb. nov.), Camponotus aurelianus (comb. rev.), Camponotus cavibregma (comb. nov.), Camponotus horrens (comb. rev.), Camponotus politae (comb. rev.), Camponotus trajanus (comb. rev.), and Camponotus yogi (comb. rev.). A further consequence is the following generic synonymy (senior synonym listed first): Colobopsis = Myrmotemnus syn. nov., and Camponotus = Dolophra syn. rev. At the species level, we argue that Camponotus apostemata and Camponotus cavibregma are junior synonyms (syn. nov.) of Camponotus yogi , and Camponotus quercicola is a junior synonym (syn. nov.) of Ca. laevigatus . Taxonomic comments are also provided on some members of the Camponotus reticulatus group, with Camponotus adustus (stat. nov.) and Ca. leucodiscus (stat. rev.) being recognized as distinct species rather than subspecies of Ca. bellus. A male-based diagnosis of the Camponotini is provided, and differences between the males of Colobopsis and Camponotus are documented and illustrated for the first time. This study reveals new character systems of potential value to the systematics of these ants, including features of the male genitalia, and emphasizes the value of reciprocal illumination between phylogenomics and critical morphological analysis.",

    "abstract": "Ants are the world's premier eusocial organisms and they have assumed pivotal ecological roles in many terrestrial communities. A well resolved and robustly supported phylogeny of the ants is needed to better understand many facets of their ecology and evolution. We report on a new project designed to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of the major lineages of ants. Funded by the US National Science Foundation under the AToL (Assembling the Tree of Life) program, this project runs for five years and involves collaborators from the University of California at Davis, the California Academy of Sciences, and the Smithsonian Institution. In the first year (2004 - 2005) of the Ant AToL grant we have focused our efforts on developing a multi-gene molecular data set and assembling a selection of appropriate taxa. A preliminary analysis, based on ~5.8 kb of sequence data from seven nuclear genes and ~100 exemplar species, reveals a number of novel findings and contradicts some earlier conclusions derived from morphological data. Nearly all of the 21 extant ant subfamilies recognized in a recent morphology-based classification of ants (Bolton 2003) appear to be  monophyletic, but our evidence suggests that only two of the six supra-subfamilial groups (dorylomorphs and myrmeciomorphs) are monophyletic. We find strong support (parsimony and likelihood bootstrap 100 %, Bayesian posterior probability 1.00) for a group, here termed the \"formicoid clade\", which contains all extant ants except Agroecomyrmecinae, Amblyoponinae, Leptanillinae, Paraponerinae, Ponerinae, and Proceratiinae. Relationships among these early diverging (non-formicoid) ants are not well resolved. This work is ongoing, and a more comprehensive account and analysis with additional taxa and new molecular data will be completed at the year's end.

    "abstract": "Using genetic, morphological, and geographical evidence, we investigate the species-level taxonomy and evolutionary history of the Pseudomyrmex elongatulus group, a clade of ants distributed from southwestern United States to Costa Rica. Through targeted enrichment of 2,524 UCE (ultraconserved element) loci we generate a phylogenomic data set and clarify the phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic history of these ants. The crown group is estimated to have originated ~8 Ma, in Mexico and/or northern Central America, and subsequently expanded into southern Central America and the southwestern Nearctic. The P. elongatulus group contains a mix of low- and high-elevation species, and there were apparently multiple transitions between these habitat types. We uncover three examples of one species\u0014of restricted or marginal geographical distribution\u0014being embedded phylogenetically in another species, rendering the latter paraphyletic. One of these cases involves an apparent workerless social parasite that occurs sympatrically with its parent species, with the latter serving as host. This suggests a sympatric origin of the parasite species within the distribution range of its host. Species boundaries are tested using three molecular delimitation approaches (SODA, bPTP, BPP) but these methods generate inflated species estimates (26\u001346 species), evidently because of a failure to distinguish population structure from species differences. In a formal taxonomic revision of the P. elongatulus group, based on almost 3,000 specimens from ~625 localities, we allow for geographic variation within species and we employ distinctness-in-sympatry criteria for testing hypotheses about species limits. Under these guidelines we recognize 13 species, of which nine are new: P. arcanus, sp. nov. (western Mexico); P. capillatus, sp. nov. (western Mexico); P. cognatus, sp. nov. (Chiapas, Mexico to Nicaragua); P. comitator, sp. nov. (Chiapas, Mexico); P. ereptor, sp. nov. (Veracruz, Mexico); P. exoratus, sp. nov. (southeastern Mexico, Honduras); P. fasciatus, sp. nov. (Chiapas, Mexico to Costa Rica); P. nimbus, sp. nov. (Costa Rica); and P. veracruzensis, sp. nov. (Veracruz, Mexico).

In 6 of 8 colonies, the minimum linear dimension or mass of seeds carried by foragers was significantly related to forager size, with r2 values ranging from 3 to 30%.  In 4 of the 5 experiments, colonies were subsequently baited with either large seed fragments alone or small fragments alone.  In 3 of these 4 experiments, I detected a rapid response, over a few hours or days, in which foragers deployed by colonies shifted to larger or smaller mean size in directions predicted by size of the bait.

We investigated whether this pattern extends to physically independent eusocial systems by measuring the metabolic rates of whole functioning colonies of the seed-harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus.  These intraspecific scaling data were compared to the predictions of an additive model developed to estimate collective metabolic rates.  Contrary to the prediction of the additive model, colony metabolic rate allometry resembled the pattern commonly observed interspecifically for individual organisms, scaling with colony mass 0.75.  Among the same-aged colonies, net growth rate varied by up to 7-fold, with larger colonies exhibiting higher net growth efficiency than smaller colonies.  Isolated worker groups exhibited isometric metabolic rate scaling, suggesting that the social environment of the colony is critical to regulating individual patterns of work output.  Within the social environment, individual worker locomotor velocities exhibited power-law distributions that scaled with colony size so that larger colonies exhibited a greater disparity between active & inactive ants than did smaller colonies.  These results demonstrate that behavioral organization within colonies may have a major influence on colony-level metabolism & in generating intraspecific variation in growth trajectories.]",

By recording video of colony behavior, for which ants were individually paint-marked for identification, it was possible to reconstruct the communication networks through which information is transmitted throughout the colony.  Whole colonies of P. californicus were found to exhibit a robust hypometric allometry in which mass-specific metabolic rates decrease with increasing colony size.  The distribution of walking speeds also scaled with colony size, so that larger colonies were composed of relatively more inactive ants than smaller colonies.  If colonies were broken into random collections of workers, metabolic rates scaled isometrically, but when entire colonies were reduced in size while retaining functionality (queens, juveniles, workers), they continued to exhibit a metabolic hypometry.

In the case of P. curvatus, some worker ants may be removed from colonies in the field and shipped to the laboratory for parasitization and then returned to their respective colonies.  To date there have been more than 84 field releases.  Surveys looking for overwintering fly populations  indicate a success rate of 48% for releases conducted in 2002-2005.  Considering the vast area that IFA has invaded, a biological control effort of this magnitude requires considerable cooperation and coordination.  To this end, a unique consortium of effort and resources has developed among IFA infested states and territories. This group includes many federal, state, and university agencies.

    "pages": "18 p.",

    "abstract": "Background: Bacterial endosymbiosis has a recurring significance in the evolution of insects. An estimated 10-20% of insect species depend on bacterial associates for their nutrition and reproductive viability. Members of the ant tribe Camponotini, the focus of this study, possess a stable, intracellular bacterial mutualist. The bacterium, Blochmannia, was first discovered in Camponotus and has since been documented in a distinct subgenus of Camponotus, Colobopsis, and in the related genus Polyrhachis. However, the distribution of Blochmannia throughout the Camponotini remains in question. Documenting the true host range of this bacterial mutualist is an important first step toward understanding the various ecological contexts in which it has evolved, and toward identifying its closest bacterial relatives. In this study, we performed a molecular screen, based on PCR amplification of 16S rDNA, to identify bacterial associates of diverse Camponotini species.  Results: Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA gave four important insights: (i) Blochmannia occurs in a broad range of Camponotini genera including Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and Opisthopsis, and did not occur in outgroups related to this tribe (e.g., Notostigma). This suggests that the mutualism originated in the ancestor of the tribe Camponotini. (ii) The known bacteriocyte-associated symbionts of ants, in Formica, Plagiolepis, and the Camponotini, arose independently. (iii) Blochmannia is nestled within a diverse clade of endosymbionts of sapfeeding hemipteran insects, such as mealybugs, aphids, and psyllids. In our analyses, a group of secondary symbionts of mealybugs are the closest relatives of Blochmannia. (iv) Blochmannia has cospeciated with its known hosts, although deep divergences at the genus level remain uncertain.  Conclusions: The Blochmannia mutualism occurs in Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and Opisthopsis, in addition to Camponotus, and probably originated in the ancestral lineage leading to the Camponotini. This significant expansion of its known host range implies that the mutualism is more ancient and ecologically diverse than previously documented. Blochmannia is most closely related to endosymbionts of sap-feeding hemipterans, which ants tend for their carbohydrate-rich honeydew. Based on phylogenetic results, we propose Camponotini might have originally acquired this bacterial mutualist through a nutritional symbiosis with other insects.

Cardiocondyla minutior appears to be originally from the Indo-Malayan region, where all its closest relatives are found. Surprisingly, there are few records of C. minutior from this region. Instead, most Old World records of C. minutior come from Pacific and Indian Ocean islands where there are few or no native ants, e.g., the Chagos Archipelago, Hawaii, Œles …parses, Easter Island, the Marquesas Islands, the Seychelles, and the Society Islands. Cardiocondyla minutior is becoming widespread in tropical and subtropical parts of the New World. The success of Cardiocondyla species in exotic locales may be due, in part, to their ability to co-exist with dominant invasive ants, such as the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile.",

    "abstract": "*[The long-legged ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes (formerly Anoplolepis longipes) has been long recognized for its impact on other invertebrates.  In the past few years, however, A. gracilipes has been brought to world attention due to its deadly attacks on nesting birds in the Seychelles & on the endemic crabs of Christmas Island.  To evaluate the distribution & potential spread of A. gracilipes, I compiled & mapped specimen records from more than 700 sites worldwide.  In tropical Asia & tropical islands of the Indian & Pacific Oceans, A. gracilipes occurs throughout the moist lowlands, but is not commonly found in arid regions & sites above 1200 m elevation.  In tropical Africa, it is known only from Dar es Salaam & nearby Zanzibar.  In tropical Australia, A. gracilipes has been recorded primarily from moist monsoon rainforests along perennial springs & streams in the northern region & in a few towns on the North & East coasts.  In the Neotropics, there are records of A. gracilipes from western Mexico.  In subtropical Asia, A. gracilipes ranges up to 26-27-degrees-N in northern India, southern China, & southern islands of Japan.  I found only 6 records from latitudes more-than 27-degrees, 2 from exterminated urban populations (Auckland, New Zealand; Brisbane, Australia) & 3 from probably temporary populations (ValparaÌso, Chile; Durban, South Africa; Zayul, Tibet).  The sixth population, on Amami-Oshima Island, Japan, may or may not be temporary.  Anoplolepis gracilipes is not yet known from many moist lowland tropical areas, where it would probably thrive, including West-central Africa & much of the Neotropics. Populations in western Mexico are prevented from expanding eastward by a central mountain range, but may be able to spread South, around the mountains, to the Caribbean, Central America, & South America.  Records from arid Baja California, Mexico indicate that A. gracilipes can invade & persist in areas with arid climates, perhaps due to moderating effects of irrigation.]",

    "abstract": "The little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, has been increasing in importance as an exotic pest. Here we review published and unpublished information on its distribution, ecology, impact, and control. Wasmannia auropunctata occurs throughout most of the warmer parts of the New World, from subtropical Argentina to subtropical Mexico and through much of the Caribbean, though it is not clear whether this species in native to this entire region. During the past century, exotic populations of W. auropunctata have become established in numerous other places, including the Galapagos Islands, West Africa (Gabon, Cameroon, and possibly the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo), Melanesia (New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and possibly Tuvalu), Polynesia (Wallis and Futuna and Hawaii), the mainland US (Florida and possibly California), and on subtropical Atlantic islands (the Bahamas and Bermuda). The latitudinal range of known outdoors populations of W. auropunctata is from 32o40'S in Argentina to 32o20'N in Bermuda. Wasmannia auropunctata is also a greenhouse pest in more temperate regions, such as England and Canada. In many areas, W. auropunctata can be a significant agricultural pest, not only stinging agricultural workers, but also enhancing populations of Homoptera. Homoptera cause damage both through sapping plants of nutrients and by increasing the occurrence of diseases, including viral and fungal infections. In addition, W. auropunctata has negative impacts on many animals, both invertebrates and vertebrates, though most reports on such impact have been anecdotal. The impacts of W. auropunctata populations seem to be most severe on tropical islands where it is not native, such as the Galapagos, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. Reports of widespread blindness in both domestic and native mammals caused by W. auropunctata stings deserve serious attention. Chemical control of W. auropunctata may be possible for small exotic populations spread over a few dozen hectares or less. For large exotic infestations, the only hope for long-term control appears to be classical biocontrol.          *[Wasmannia williamsoni misspelled Wasmannia williamsi.]",

To evaluate its worldwide distribution & potential for further spread, we mapped records of L. humile from more than 2100 sites.  Because several South & Central American Linepithema species have been often mis-identified as L. humile, we excluded all unconfirmed South & Central American records.  We documented the earliest known L. humile records for 95 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major islands, & US states), including several for which we found no previously published records.  We could not confirm any L. humile records from several South & Central American countries with published reports.Most records of L. humile come from the subtropics, particularly from regions with Mediterranean-like climates (i.e., warm dry summers and cool moist winters), including its native range in South America & exotic populations in California, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, & Japan.  In more humid subtropical areas, such as the southeast US, L. humile rarely dominates outside urban areas.  In tropical latitudes, L. humile dominates only at higher elevations, most notably in Hawaii.  In temperate areas, L. humile is almost exclusively an indoor pest.  Linepithema humile has already spread to most subtropical lowland regions with Mediterranean-like climates, but is not known yet from most tropical highland areas with suitable climates.  In the past, L. humile probably arrived in tropical regions by sea accompanying human commerce & had to survive coastal lowland conditions before spreading to higher, cooler elevations.  Nowadays air travel allows L. humile to stowaway in cargo delivered almost anywhere in the world.  Therefore, a wider spread of this pest is expected in the future.]",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial salamanders are integral components of forest ecosystems and the examination of their feeding habits may provide useful information regarding various ecosystem processes. We studied the diet of the Del Norte Salamander (Plethodon elongatus) and assessed diet differences between age classes, genders, and seasons. The stomachs of 309 subadult and adult salamanders, captured in spring and fall, contained 20 prey types. Nineteen were invertebrates, and one was a juvenile Del Norte Salamander, representing the first reported evidence of cannibalism in this species. Mites and ants represented a significant component of the diet across all age classes and genders, and diets of subadult and adult salamanders were fairly similar overall. We detected, however, an ontogenetic shift with termites and ants becoming less important and spiders and mites becoming more important with age. These differences between subadults and adults can likely be attributed to the inability of subadults to consume larger prey items due in part to gape limitation. The diet of the Del Norte Salamander, like other plethodontids, consists of a high diversity of prey items making it an opportunistic, sit-and wait predator.

Interestingly, we found the abundance of most CHCs had a negative correlation with survival, regardless of compound class. We suggest that the CHC differences between L. humile nests in California are insufficient to explain their differential survival against desiccation, and that body mass is a better predictor of desiccation survival at this scale of comparison.]",

Monophyly of the genus is strongly supported in parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian analyses of the concatenated data, as is the monophyly of four species groups defined previously on the basis of morphology. An Andean species, L. oblongum (Santschi), is the sister taxon of the Argentine ant. Eight of the 11 species whose monophyly was testable in the analysis were inferred to be monophyletic. Several instances of species paraphyly and one case of mitochondrial introgression suggest that complex population genetic processes underpin the patterns of diversity in Linepithema, and that simple genetic approaches to taxonomy such as DNA barcoding should be treated with caution. A maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral distributions suggests that Linepithema is of southern South American origin and that populations in the Greater Antilles are the result of four independent colonization events.",

    "abstract": "The future range of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, (RIFA) within the United States was predicted based on its current distribution. A dynamic model of colony growth with two time steps per day was formulated to evaluate colony area and alate production. Colony growth rate depends on daily max/min soil temperatures. Temperature records from 4,537 meteorological stations within the current (near 1.5 million km2) and potential range of RIFA were obtained from NOAA data banks. At each station, a colony was allowed to grow and lifetime female alate production was calculated. Alate production was then matched to the current distribution extremes in Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma. Four zones of colony proliferation success were defined: certain, possible, undemonstrated, and improbable. An annual precipitation limit was selected to indicate regions where arid conditions may prohibit growth in non-irrigated areas. Results of the model predict that RIFA will likely move 80 to150 km North in Oklahoma and Arkansas. They will also likely continue expanding into portions of Virginia, Maryland and Delaware in the East, and New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon, Nevada and maybe even Washington in the West. Geographic Information Systems (GIs) software tools were used to visualize and spatially analyze the results of this model.

    "abstract": "Objective: To review the present understanding of biological control methods for imported fire ants (IFAs). Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE, Biological Abstracts, and the US Department of Agriculture Formis Ant Literature database. Study Selection: All articles published in the last 10 years on biological control of fire ants were selected. Results: The decapitating flies Pseudacteon tricuspis, Pseudacteon curvatus, and Pseudacteon litoralis have been successfully released in the United States. The continued releases of multiple species of decapitating flies will expand the area of impact, applying greater pressure on IFA populations throughout the southern United States. The microsporidium Thelohania solenopsae causes the slow demise of a fire ant colony. The advantages of T solenopsae as a biological control agent include debilitation of queens, specificity for IFAs, self-sustaining infections, and lower relative tolerance to chemical pesticides. Solenopsis daguerrei has also been shown to have detrimental effects on IFA colony growth, the number of sexual reproductives produced, and the number of host queens in multiple queen colonies; however, this parasite is difficult to rear in the laboratory and to introduce into IFA colonies. Conclusions: It is unlikely that IFAs can be completely eradicated from the United States. However, technology using chemicals and/or natural control agents could eventually maintain populations at low levels if an integrated approach is used for control.

Nymphs and adults feed on seeds within C. californicus fruit. Bugs oviposit on the underside of leaves, and females guard their eggs and first-instar nymphs from natural enemies. Embryonic orientation of prolarvae is nonrandom; each embryo is oriented with its venter directed toward the ground. This orientation may facilitate aggregation of first instars. The longitudinal axes of eggs are always oriented upward at about a 16∞ angle of deviation from a line perpendicular to the leaf surface. This is the first recorded observation of this phenomenon in Pentatomoidea. Experimental removal of females guarding first instars results in 100% loss of nymphs, and this is attributed to disruption of the aggregative behavior of nymphs. Maternal guarding appears to be a net benefit to P. stallii, despite possible costs to the brooding female.   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)          *[Antagonism by Dorymyrmex bicolor Wheeler sometimes caused brooding P. stallii females to abandon their egg masses, after which the ants devoured the eggs.  Dorymyrmex bicolor were sometimes observed attacking nymphs on the soil beneath Croton californicus.]",

The secretion is a powerful attractant, which excites workers and draws them out of the nest in the direction indicated by the trail. Trail-laying, as measured by the extrusion of the sting, is an all-or-none response of individual workers; hence individual trails do not communicate quantity or quality of the food find. The trail substance is highly species-specific.  In transposition experiments utilizing the fire ant species Solenopsis invicta, S. geminata, & S. xyloni, it was found that the geminata secretion is different from that of the other 2 species.  The secretions of invicta and xyloni are more interchangeable, but appear to differ somewhat.  The S. molesta & other myrmicines tested, also do not share the invicta trail substances.  Curiously, the Dufour's gland secretion of the dolichoderine species Monacis bispinosa causes a full response in invicta workers, but M. bispinosa uses another substance for its trails.]          [NOTE: S. saevissima is S. invicta or S. richteri in North America.]",

    "abstract": "Pollinators such as bees need reliable access to nectar resources. However, competition for these carbohydrate rewards can be high among floral visitors. Moreover, invasive insects may further restrict pollinator access to flowers. For example, invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) are known to harass and displace pollinators from flowers and reduce nectar reward acquisition. The foraging behavior of bees is strongly influenced by numerous chemical cues and signals at the flower. Thus, to avoid aggressive floral visitors, bees may use chemical cues when deciding whether or not they forage on the flower. Here, we demonstrate that Argentine ants deposit a pygidial gland chemical, iridomyrmecin, on a sugar source while feeding. Based on two-choice laboratory assays conducted with three commercially available bee species, the presence of iridomyrmecin in the sugar resource influenced the foraging decisions of Megachile rotundata and Osmia lignaria, but not those of Apis mellifera. Detailed insights into the chemical signals left by ants at floral resources and their effects on foraging decisions by pollinators can provide vital information for understanding the magnitude and mechanisms of impacts invasive ant species might have on pollinators.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of nitrogen deposition and precipitation on Messor pergandei (Mayr) harvester ants and plants to identify alterations in the desert food web in California. We measured ant colony attributes and shrub fruit densities, as well as nitrogen and carbon concentrations and stable isotopes, at 18 sites along a nitrogen deposition gradient. Ant nest density increased from low to high deposition sites; however, ant nest mound size and the density of abandoned nests decreased as deposition increased. Nest mound size was positively correlated with the size and age of the colony; therefore, these results suggest that colonization has been more frequent with increased inter-colony competition in areas of high deposition. Nitrogen and carbon isotope values of perennial plant leaves and seeds, annual plant seeds, and ants were significantly enriched in the heavy isotopes from low to high nitrogen deposition regions, indicating the possibility of plants assimilating different sources of both elements, including anthropogenically-produced compounds. Plant carbon isotope discrimination also differed with the decrease in precipitation across the gradient. Considering that deserts are limited by both nitrogen and precipitation, our results suggest that altered nitrogen inputs in conjunction with precipitation may result in cascading effects through trophic levels and drive arid ecosystem change.

Many introduced species are able to establish in new environments & some even become invasive.  However, we do not know which traits enable them to survive & reproduce in new environments.  This study aims to identify the characteristics of exotic ants, & to quantitatively test previously postulated, but insufficiently tested assumptions.  We collected data on 9 traits of 93 exotic ant species (42 of them being invasive) & 323 native ant species in North America.  The dataset includes 2536 entries from over 300 different sources; data on worker head width were mostly measured ourselves.  We analyzed the data with 3 complementary analyses: univariate & multivariate analyses of the raw data, & multivariate analyses of phylogenetically independent contrasts.  These analyses revealed significant differences between the traits of native & exotic ant species.  In the multivariate analyses, only one trait was consistently included in the best models, estimated with AIC/c values: colony size.  Thus, of the 9 investigated traits, the most important characteristic of exotic ants as compared to native ants appears to be their large colony size.  Other traits are also important, however, indicating that native & exotic ants differ by a suite of traits.]          *[Technomyrmex difficilis (Forel 1892) = albipes (Smith 1861); Solenopsis invicta (Buren 1972) = wagneri (Santschi 1916); Linepithema humile / Iridomyrmex humilis (Mayr 1868); Ectatomma (Parectatomma) triangulare / Gnamptogenys triangularis (Mayr 1887); Basiceros floridanum / Eurhopalothrix floridana (Brown and Kempf 1960); Crematogaster obscurata (Emery 1895) = agnita (Wheeler 1934); Cardiocondyla mauritanica (Forel 1890) = ectopia (Snelling 1974); Brachymyrmex patagonicus (Mayr 1868) = musculus (Forel 1899); Anoplolepis gracilipes (longipes) (Smith 1857); Neivamyrmex swainsonii (Shuckard 1840) / Neivamyrmex fallax (Borgmeier 1953); Myrmica latifrons (Staercke 1927) = emeryana (Cole 1942).]",

    "abstract": "Plant invasions have tremendous potential to alter food webs by changing basal resources. Recent studies document how plant invasions may contribute to increased arthropod abundances in detritus-based food webs. An obvious mechanism for this phenomenon--a bottom-up effect resulting from elevated levels of detritus from the invasive plant litter--has not been explicitly studied. We examined the effects of an annual grass invasion on ground arthropod assemblages in the coastal sage scrub (CSS) of southern California. Bottom-up food web theory predicts that the addition of detritus would increase generalist-feeding arthropods at all trophic levels; accordingly, we expected increases in fungi, Collembola, and common predators such as mites and spiders. For the common ant taxa, habitat alteration may also be important for predicting responses. Thus we expected that Forelius mccooki and Pheidole vistana, the most common ant species, would decline because of changes in soil temperature (F. mccooki) and habitat structure (P. vistana) associated with litter. We studied trends observationally and conducted a 3-year experiment in which we manipulated litter quantity. In contrast to other published studies, most detritus-based arthropod taxa declined in areas of high grass invasion, and, within trophic levels, responses often varied idiosyncratically. For the two most common taxa, a native ant (F. mccooki), and predatory mites in the Anystidae, we experimentally linked declines in abundance to increased levels of invasive grass litter. Such declines, especially those exhibited by the most common ant taxa, could have cascading effects on the CSS ecosystem, where ants are numerically dominant and thus may have broad influences on food web and ecosystem properties. Our results highlight that accurately predicting arthropod responses to invasive plant litter requires careful consideration of the structural and food resources provided by detritus to each particular food web.",

The screenings showed that total number of enemy species is lowest in these recent introduced areas (1 +- 0.89) than in South America (5 +- 1.00) or in the US (3.3 +- 0.57), with SINV-1 appearing in all populations but not Australia and New Zealand, and SINV-2 only in California and Taiwan. Although the pattern here seems to parallel the general prediction that invasive species leave majority of enemies behind, ongoing eradication efforts in such areas hinder the study from testing whether the populations have gone through the demographic proliferation as a result of enemy release. Despite shortcoming, previous studies did revealed significant costly impacts of these missing enemies on fitness either at an individual or colony level, hence, successful invasion of S. invicta in these recently invaded areas may be explained, at least partly, by conspicuous absence of these enemies.

    "abstract": "Loss of natural enemies during colonization is a prominent hypothesis explaining enhanced performance of invasive species in introduced areas. Numerous studies have tested this enemy release hypothesis in a wide range of taxa but few studies have focused on invasive ants. We conducted extensive surveys for the presence of six microbes in recently established populations (California, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and China) of the invasive fire ant Solenopsis invicta. These microbes include Wolbachia, two microsporidia (Kneallhazia solenopsae and Vairimorpha invictae) and three RNA viruses (SINV-1, -2 and -3), all of which previously have been reported in native South American populations of S. invicta. These surveys showed that the total number of enemy species is lower in the recently invaded areas compared with both South American and US populations. Only two microbes were found in any of these recently invaded areas: SINV-1 was detected in all surveyed populations except Australia and New Zealand, and SINV-2 was detected in California and Taiwan only. These results support the general prediction that invasive species lose many of their natural enemies during invasion. Further, the conspicuous absence of some of these microbes in these areas may result from strong selection against founders due to fitness costs associated with harboring detrimental infections rather than the alternative hypothesis that they simply were absent among the original founders. While the successful invasion of S. invicta in these recently invaded areas may be explained partly by the absence of natural enemies, other factors likely have been important as well.

In this study, we examined whether L. humile foraging routes minimize travel distance and maximize linearity (i.e., have the fewest turns). Colonies of L. humile foraged in an artificial grid containing a number of possible routes to a long-lasting food source. In the design, there were three possible shortest routes that varied only in the number of turns that the ants had to make. The majority of foraging ants preferred one of the three shortest routes to the food, and significantly favored the path with the fewest turns. Selection of the shortest, straightest route may maximize mass recruitment to the food source by decreasing the chance of foraging ants losing the trail.",

    "abstract": "1. In ant-hemipteran mutualisms, ants receive carbohydrates in the form of honeydew, while hemipterans receive protection from natural enemies. In the absence of natural enemies, however, the direct effects of tending are generally less well known. We hypothesised that with increasing tending intensity (ant to aphid ratio), aphid performance would increase initially, then decrease at high tending levels due to the metabolic cost of producing high quality honeydew. 2. We tested our hypothesis in a greenhouse experiment by manipulating Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr) colony size while holding constant the initial size of aphid (Chaitophorus populicola Thomas) aggregations. The two parameters associated with survival, aphid survivorship to maturity and longevity, declined with increasing tending intensity, whereas per capita birth rate and time to first reproduction showed no relationship to attendance. The intrinsic rate of increase declined only at relatively high tending levels, suggesting a nonlinearity in the effect of tending intensity. 3. Tending intensity measured in the experiment was similar to that observed in free-living aggregations of C. populicola. Furthermore, the per capita recruitment rate of ants to free-living aphid aggregations was negatively density-dependent, indicating that small aggregations tend to experience the highest levels of tending intensity. This finding suggests that the aphid's intrinsic rate of increase may be positively density-dependent, mediated by the aphid's mutualistic interaction with the ant. 4. In the Argentine ant-C. populicola interaction, experimental manipulation of colony size revealed a direct cost of ant attendance that was conditional upon tending intensity. Experiments that manipulate only ant presence or absence may yield an incomplete understanding of the mutualistic interaction if underlying nonlinearities exist.",

Ants often tend multiple species of honeydew-producing insects; however, studies that examine such effects typically consider only pairwise mutualisms. This study investigates how multi-species mutualisms between ants and honeydew-producing insects structure arthropod food webs in citrus. In an organic lemon orchard in San Diego County, California, U.S.A., ants or honeydew-producing insects (or neither) were experimentally removed from individual, mature lemon trees and then abundances of the following were estimated over a 2-year period: the Argentine ant, five species of honeydew-producing hemipterans, and California red scale. Red scale produces no honeydew but indirectly benefits from the presence of ants, which disrupt parasitism by Aphytis wasps. Mutualism between ants and honeydew-producing hemipterans indirectly and positively affected red scale. Levels of parasitism decreased with increasing ant recruitment, and red scale density increased with both increasing ant recruitment and increasing honeydew-producing hemipteran abundance. Moreover, abundances of each of three honeydew-producing hemipteran species emerged as positive predictors of red scale density in different analyses; this finding suggests that individual hemipteran taxa exhibit distinct and spatially localised effects on ants. Evidence of positive, indirect effects between two focal species of honeydew-producing Hemiptera was also detected. Guilds of honeydew-producing hemipterans may provide ants with honeydew more consistently or for longer than that produced by any single species. These results argue for an appreciation of how mutualist diversity affects the ecological consequences of mutualisms.",

In the short term, these organized attacks cause harvester ants to cease foraging & to plug their nest entrances.

The short-term introduction of experimental Argentine ant colonies outside of P. subnitidus nest entrances stimulated behaviors similar to those observed in raids.  P. subnitidus decreased its foraging activity & increased the number of nest entrance workers, many of which labored to plug their nest entrances.  Raids are not likely to be the result of competition for food.  As expected, P. subnitidus foraged primarily on plant material (85% of food items obtained from returning foragers), but also collected some dead insects (7% of food items).  In buffet-style choice tests in which we offered Argentine ants food items obtained from P. subnitidus, L. humile only showed interest in dead insects.

Control 12:231-236, 1998), an in vitro microtiter dish assay was developed to monitor ADF activity produced by bacteria grown in cultures.  Using these methods, we show that ADF activity is present in the supernatants of bacterial cultures, is filterable, heat stable, and acid sensitive, and passes through a 10-kDa-pore-size membrane.  Thus, ADF appears to be comprised of a small, extracellular, and possibly nonproteinaceous compound(s).  The amount of ADF repellency detected depends on the ant species being tested, the sucrose concentration (in vitro assays), and the strain, form, and age of the ADF-producing bacteria.
