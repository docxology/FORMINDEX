    "abstract": "Maintaining and updating FORMIS requires the cooperative efforts of myrmecologists throughout the world.  >>Please begin by inspecting citations of your own work for accuracy and completeness<<.  The addition of keywords and/or abstracts would be especially useful.  Please see the next section for instructions about how to contribute or update citations.  AGRICOLA will be searched to keep FORMIS updated; however, this will only find a small portion of the literature.  It is hoped that this database will become a magnet and distribution mechanism for specialty ant bibliographies like the Fire Ant Literature Database.  Specialty bibliographies are needed for genera such as Formica, Camponotus, Myrmica, Pheidole, Monomorium, Messor and Cataglyphis to name a few.  Specialty bibliographies on subjects such as foraging, bioenergetics, myrmecophiles, and ant-plant symbioses would also be useful.  Geographic bibliographies for places like Hawaii, India, Mexico, Brazil, etc. could also be assembled.  Specialty bibliographies can range from a few dozen citations to several thousand; the only requirement is that they be thorough.  New citations could also be added by journal.  Please contact Dr. Porter if you are interested in adding a bibliography to FORMIS.  Users are welcome to create their own customized bibliographies from FORMIS; however, they should be aware that personal modifications to FORMIS will be lost in future updates if they are not sent in for official inclusion.  Also, users who use EndNote to automatically create bibliographies at the end of their papers should be aware that citation numbers in FORMIS will not be consistant from year to year, so a paper started on one database needs to be finished on the same one.",

Since the early 1990's, A. gracilipes supercolonies have occupied over 30% of the 10,000-ha of rainforest on Christmas Island.  Thirty-four discrete high-density supercolonies formed between 1989 & 2003, ranging in size across nearly 3-orders of magnitude from 0.9 to 787-ha.  Supercolonies boundaries are diffuse, & ants were observed in low densities in some cases up to 200-m from the main high-density supercolony.  The 13 boundaries examined were all dynamic over a 10-20 observation month period, 9 boundaries expanded, & the maximum rate of spread was 0.5-m day-1.  Across boundary transition zones, between high-density supercolonies & intact  rainforest, A. gracilipes reduced other ant species richness, occupied red crab burrows, & killed resident red crabs, which was the trigger for 'invasional meltdown' on Christmas Island.  The highly variable & unpredictable nature of A. gracilipes boundaries poses a challenge for incorporation into a predictive framework, as well as for their management.  Gives good evidence that mating flights do occur as well as colony budding.]",

    "abstract": "Positive interactions play a widespread role in facilitating biological invasions. Here we use a landscape-scale ant exclusion experiment to show that widespread invasion of tropical rainforest by honeydew-producing scale insects on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean) has been facilitated by positive interactions with the invasive ant Anoplolepis gracilipes. Toxic bait was used to exclude A. gracilipes from large (9-35 ha) forest patches. Within 11 weeks, ant activity on the ground and on trunks had been reduced by 98-100%, while activity on control plots remained unchanged. The exclusion of ants caused a 100% decline in the density of scale insects in the canopies of three rainforest trees in 12 months (Inocarpus fagifer, Syzygium nervosum and Barringtonia racemosa), but on B. racemosa densities of scale insects also declined in control plots, resulting in no effect of ant exclusion on this species. This study demonstrates the role of positive interactions in facilitating biological invasions, and supports recent models calling for greater recognition of the role of positive interactions in structuring ecological communities.",

    "abstract": "*[On Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, sexual brood of the invasive Yellow Crazy Ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes (Smith, 1857), was produced annually during a single period associated with the onset of the wet season.  However, workers were produced continuously throughout the year & colony investment to worker production measured by the standing biomass of eggs, larvae, & pupae, typically exceeded 98%.  High, aseasonal investment in worker production, together with aseasonal worker activity, would suggest that there should be no seasonal preference shown by workers at food stations containing both protein & carbohydrate.  However, workers showed a preference for one food type over another on 46 of 61 occasions at one site & on 31 of 41 occasions at another.  When a preference was shown, it was predominantly for protein-rich food during the dry season & almost always for carbohydrate at the onset & during the wet season.  We suggest that these preferences reflect seasonal shortages in key resources when invertebrates (protein-rich) are scarce during the dry season & honeydew from scale insects (carbohydrate) is depleted by rain during the wet season.  On Christmas Island, timing & duration of the dry season preference for protein has been exploited by the control program for A.\tgracilipes supercolonies, which deploys a toxin in a proteinaceous bait matrix during dry periods.]",

A significant positive linear correlation was found between the number of extrafloral nectaries per leaf, calyx, bract, and bracteole and the patrolling time of C. compressus, Camponotus paria (Emery), Pheidole spec., and Tetramorium spec. (all Hymenoptera: Formicidae) at the corresponding plant parts. Many one-to-one deterrent interactions between the ant visitors and adult R. foveicollis were recorded, with C. compressus being involved in most encounters on the calyx and bracts, Pheidole spec. on the leaves, and Pachycondyla tesserinoda (Emery) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on the bracteoles. Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabr.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) exhibited significant deterrent effects on adult herbivores on the corolla when in groups larger than 15 ants. Ant exclusion and inclusion experiments revealed a significant reduction in the residence time, as well as dose- and time-dependent reduction in the frequency of visits of the herbivore on crop plants with C. compressus, C. paria, Pheidole spec., and T. melanocephalum ants, compared to the control. Results support the optimal defense hypothesis, as the plant structures most closely linked to plant fitness bear the extrafloral nectaries and are defended by the visiting ant species.

Investigation of prey diversity & temporal activity patterns with the null model tests of niche overlap revealed a significant overlap indicating that the activity periods & prey diversity may not be solely influenced by interactions among the co-existing ant species.  However, niche partitioning in the daily peak activity periods was demonstrated during all the 3 seasons (summer, rainy, & winter) particularly between Pheidole sp. &  T. melanocephalum.  Pheidole sp. exhibited a high intensity, broadly extended mono-modal foraging pattern.  Camponotus compressus & C. paria showed bi-modality in their foraging activity during the rainy season & mono-modal patterns during summer & winter seasons.  Pachycondyla tesserinoda, Tetramorium sp., & T. melanocephalum exhibited peak foraging activities in the morning hours during the summer & rainy seasons.  The activity profiles of C. compressus & T. melanocephalum were skewed towards late afternoon hours during the winter season, indicating avoidance of foraging activity during the favorable periods when the more aggressive Pheidole sp. is active.  In the sponge gourd agroecosystem, the ants captured predominantly Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, & Coleoptera.  While Pheidole sp. hunted mainly the large orthopteran prey, other ant species captured worker ants in the sponge gourd agroecosystem.  In the cauliflower agroecosystem, Pheidole sp. was the only species to also hunt orthopteran prey.  Other ant species captured prey chiefly belonging to Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Isoptera, & Diptera.

Thus, the higher density of extrafloral nectaries at vulnerable plant sites, along with the visits of ants to such sites, may influence the spatiotemporal activity patterns of the insect herbivores.]          *[Ten ant species were recorded on the plants. The 6 most abundant ant species were Camponotus compressus, Camponotus paria, Pachycondyla tesserinoda, Pheidole sp., Tapinoma melanocephalum, & Tetramorium sp.  During April & June, there were significantly more C. compressus & C. paria than Pheidole sp., P. tesserinoda, & Aphaenogaster sp.  In May, only C. compressus were significantly more abundant.

    "abstract": "1. Field investigation of the association between sponge gourd, Luffa cylindrica plants and its ant visitors revealed that five of the six most frequent species: Camponotus compressus, C. paria, Pheidole sp., Pachycondyla tesserinoda and Tetramorium sp. Mainly visited the extrafloral (EF) nectaries present on the leaves, bracts, bracteoles and calyx of the plant.  Tapinoma melanocephalum was the only ant species observed at the floral as well as the EF nectaries.   2. A bioassay of ant behavior revealed aversion to young and mature unisexual flowers of sponge gourd in the five predominantly EF nectary-visiting ant species, while floral preference was demonstrated in T. melanocephalum.  A significant difference was not found in the number of insect pollinators visiting T. melanocephalum occupied and un-occupied flowers, suggesting the absence of deterrent effect of this tiny ant species on the pollinators.  3. Further behavioral assays showed preference for 2- and 4-day-old leaves and also 2-day-old buds, while the 4-day-old buds induced avoidance in all the species. Androecium and gynoecium had significantly higher repellent effects in comparison to the petals. Thus floral repellents probably help to reduce nectar theft and prevent loss of pollen function.    4. This aversion was not demonstrated in the case of old flowers. A significantly greater number of insect pollinators visited young and mature flowers compared with old flowers, suggesting that selective exclusion of medium- and large-sized EF nectary-visiting ant species from the flowers, as a result of aversion to floral repellents, serves to avoid the threat of attack to insect pollinators of sponge gourd.",

Field observations revealed that six ant species, the most important being Pheidole sp., preyed on the crop-damaging stages of DBM and BC. Bait experiments with larvae of DBM and BC, placed randomly on the ground, demonstrated significant active retrieval by Pheidole sp. Investigations on larval density of both the insect pests on cauliflower crops, located within 1-5 m distances from nests of Pheidole sp., revealed a significant increase in the level of infestation of the crop plants with increasing distance from the ant nests. While a significant negative correlation was found between infested plants with low larval densities, a positive correlation was found between plants with high larval densities with regard to the distance of crop plant location from the ant nest. Ant-inclusion and -exclusion experiments under field conditions further confirmed the role of predatory ants, with Pheidole sp. having the major impact in the direct retrieval of the lepidopteran larvae from the crop plants. A significant difference was found in the leaf area damaged by BC larvae between the ant-included and -excluded potted plants during the 6-h observation period. Thus, this study provides direct evidence of the role of ants in actively searching and directly preying on the larval stages of DBM and BC, on cauliflower plants. Moreover, we demonstrate that in ephemeral, annual cropping agroecosystems, predatory ants are important natural enemies of lepidopteran pests, playing a significant role in plant protection.",

To test this, we used an online database (antmaps.org) to compare the geographic distribution of ants in major habitat types (rainforest, limestone forest, rubber plantation) in Xishuangbanna, SW China.  Additionally, we conducted a meta-analysis of 24 other papers & compared the geographic distribution of ants in primary & secondary forests, & rubber plantations.  Our results showed that rubber-plantation ants had, on average, wider geographic distributions, compared with rainforest & limestone-forest ants in Xishuangbanna.  The same distributional pattern was observed from the global meta-analysis.  Species that were characteristic of rubber plantations occupied wider geographic distributions than primary-forest ants, while secondary forest ants had intermediate geographic distributions.  However, when only native ants were analyzed, geographic distributions did not vary among the 3 habitats.  Our results show that forest conversion to monoculture rubber plantations replaces habitat specialist species with non-native generalists, which have broader geographic distributions.  This replacement by generalists results in homogenization of ants in disturbed habitats, which may alter ecosystem functions & services.]",

    "abstract": "Tea mosquito bug (TMB), Helopeltis antonii V. Signoret (Heteroptera: Miridae) is a major insect pest in cashew production in India. Current control strategy consistently applies conventional pesticides especially insecticides of organophosphates, carbamates and synthetic pyrethroids. A three round calendar based spray schedule is the most popular measure being adopted across the country, providing desirable control of tea mosquito bug. However, the use of broad-spectrum insecticidal sprays, even occasionally, has profound influence on the pest and beneficial fauna of the cashew ecosystem, resulting in environmental and social problems. Organic cashew growers have no effective pest management options to limit TMB damage, because other soft chemicals are also ineffective. The tree inhabitating red weaver ants Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius) (Formicidae: Hymenoptera) are known to control over fifty species of insect pests on many tropical tree crops across the world. Not much research work has been carried out previously in respect of biocontrol potentials of weaver ants in India. Nowadays research interest is on the increase to recognize the weaver ants in a control programme of cashew pests. Prior studies have confirmed that the prevalence of weaver ant is correlated with reduction of Helopeltis populations in certain cashew plantings of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in South India. In the present paper, the existing pest management situation and the significance of ant husbandry practices for a future integrated control programme of tea mosquito bug are discussed.",

This study seeks to identify solutions to this general problem by evaluating the efficacy of common household items as barriers to deter ants from infesting cat food. Fifteen products were evaluated for deterring the ants. Trials using boards with an array of the products were used to identify those successful in deterring the ants. Additionally, the effect of each of the successful items on the cat's appetite was assessed to identify any products that might reduce the cat's appetite. The experiments revealed that only three products were completely successful in deterring the ants in all trials: ground cinnamon, turmeric, and baby powder, of which the cinnamon and baby powder were observed to have less significant effects on the cat's appetite than the turmeric. Furthermore, all three of the products remained effective throughout seven days without reapplication. The findings in this study show that household products can be particularly useful to families who are traveling and leaving their cats alone at home, but they can also be used every day in place of artificial ant deterrents. Overall, this paper should serve as a guide for pet owners on how to better protect their pet's food from ant and other insect infestations using household products. This study should also serve as a foundation for additional research to be conducted regarding at-home pest control.",

However, a recent taxonomic revision of the genus recognized only 79 species.  Such contrasting views have major implications for an understanding of not only the diversity of such an important genus, but also its biogeography & evolutionary history.  The taxonomic revision considered I. anceps (Roger) to represent a single species, despite its marked morphological variation & range from Australia to India & China.  Subsequently, a preliminary morphological analysis recognized 6 species within the complex.  Here we describe results from an integrated morphological, CO1, & distributional analysis that assesses if the 6 morphologically based taxa are differentiated genetically, & if there are additional species in the complex that are yet to be recognized.  We found the morphological differentiation within the complex to be matched by extensive genetic divergence, & that matched morphological & genetic differentiation frequently occurs in sympatry.  We recognize up to 18 species among our sequenced specimens from the complex, with their centre of diversity occurring in Queensland.  Our findings are consistent with results showing that other Iridomyrmex species recognized in the taxonomic revision represent several to many actual species.  The recognition of only 79 species of Iridomyrmex does not reflect true diversity within this ecologically dominant genus, nor the complexity of its biogeography & evolutionary history.]",

After the death of the gamergate or her absence following colony fission, the gamergate is replaced by a newly eclosed nestmate worker.  After a replacement, colonies go through short-lived periods in which 2 matrilines of sisters co-occur.  This is a situation which can be described as serial polygyny.  To measure the consequences of serial polygyny, a genetic analysis was performed on 449 workers from 46 colonies of D. cyaneiventre using 5 microsatellite loci.   The presence of more than one matriline among workers of the same nest was detected in 19% of colonies, indicating a recent change of gamergate.  The average genetic relatedness among nestmate workers was 0.751 & did not significantly differ from the theoretical expectation under strict monogyny & monandry (0.75).  We show that the rate of gamergate turnover relative to the rate of worker turnover is the crucial parameter determining the level of serial polygyny & its effect on the genetic structure of colonies.  This parameter, estimated from our data, confirms that serial polygyny occurs in D. cyaneiventre, but is not strong enough to influence significantly the average genetic relatedness among workers.]",

    "abstract": "Recruitment is a fundamental feature of animal societies and its efficiency largely depends on within-group communication. Insect societies are often populous and decentralised decisions need to be made by individuals with limited local information when time is of the essence. Recruitment of colony members to food, defence or to a new nest fall under this category. Colony relocation in tandem running ants is a particularly important case where only a small number of leaders possess information about the new nest and time is crucial, as longer exposure is detrimental to the colony\u0019s survival and reproduction. We investigated the programmes and positional effects of individual members during relocation of the Indian tropical ant Diacamma indicum in their natural habitat. Analysis of more than 1000 transports across eight relocating colonies reveals that they have a path efficiency of 85%. We found that transporters reoriented towards the target nest within seconds of initiation and tandem running in this species is so well organised that over 97% of transports reached their target nest without facing any interruption indicating that the communication between leaders and followers was exceptional. With an average speed of 3.8 cm per second these are the fastest tandem running ants recorded. We used mixed-effects model to understand the effect of patch heterogeneity and transport type on the speed and path efficiency of these ants and found that tandem leaders reduced their speed when traversing grassy patches and relied upon the slower coupled adult-brood transport. This investigation of ants performing tandem runs through heterogeneous terrains showcases the exceptionally efficient recruitment dynamics during colony relocation. In the next step, similar studies in the context of foraging and guarding in the natural habitat will be required to fully appreciate the recruitment capabilities of these superorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Most organisms need to make temporal and spatial choices pertaining to a wide range of activities like mating, feeding and resting. Arriving at a consensus on facing a choice could be even more challenging in social insects as inputs from multiple individuals need to be consolidated. Colony relocation is one such event that showcases the interplay between individual inputs and colony level choices. Diacamma indicum is a ponerine ant that uses tandem running for colony relocation. A small subset of the colony become transporters by either transporting brood or males in their mandibles or by becoming tandem leaders and leading all adult females via tandem running to the new nest. Previous studies show the importance of these individuals in the relocation process and document the presence of leader following leader events, which may be a means for information exchange among leaders. The present set of experiments evaluate colony relocation dynamics in the context of two unequal, but equidistant target nests by following 1135 uniquely marked ants. When faced with a light and dark nest, indecision was minimal and all ten colonies relocated to the dark nest. Knowledge of both targets was not crucial for choice of the better option as less than 10% of transporters had visited both targets before initiating transports. A transporter's latency to start transportation was not influenced by the number of individuals present at the target nest or by the mode of discovery; independent exploration or through leader following leader event. Further the contribution of dependent transporters was found to be significantly lower than independent transporters. Examining decision making by individual transporter and how they influence colony level choice across this simple scenario will enable in understanding the versatility of tandem running recruitment.",

Non-dependence on quantitative data and the ability to relate the phylogenetic structure of assemblages with ecological conditions of the habitat, and to ascertain priorities for conservation of habitats, makes non-parametric taxonomic diversity measures, such as variation in taxonomic distinctness delta+ and average taxonomic distinctness delta+, highly useful tools for assessment of litter ant biodiversity. Although delta+ values saturated leading to closer values for the 3 litter ant assemblages, delta+ proved to be a more dependable index. Evenness in taxonomic spread was high in ant assemblages in deciduous forests and low in evergreen forests compared to the regional master list. Low delta+ of ant assemblage in deciduous forests indicates that among the 3 forest vegetation types, deciduous forests provided the most favorable habitat conditions for litter ants. Low evenness, as is indicated by delta+ in evergreen forests, was attributed to the presence of a group of taxonomically closely related ant assemblage more adapted to prevail in moist and wet ecological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Ophiocordyceps species infecting ants - the so-called zombie-ant fungi - comprise one of the most intriguing and fascinating relationships between microbes and animals. They are widespread within tropical forests worldwide, with relatively few reports from temperate ecosystems. These pathogens possess the ability to manipulate host behaviour in order to increase their own fitness. Depending on the fungal species involved the infected ants are manipulated either to leave the nest to ascend understorey shrubs, to die biting onto vegetation, or descend from the canopy to die at the base of trees. Experimental evidence has demonstrated that the behavioural change aids spore dispersal and thus increases the chances of infection, because of the existing behavioural immunity expressed inside ant colonies that limits fungal development and transmission. Despite their undoubted importance for ecosystem functioning, these fungal pathogens are still poorly documented, especially regarding their diversity, ecology and evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe 15 new species of Ophiocordyceps with hirsutella-like asexual morphs that exclusively infect ants. These form a monophyletic group that we identified in this study as myrmecophilous hirsutelloid species. We also propose new combinations for species previously described as varieties and provide for the first time important morphological and ecological information. The species proposed herein were collected in Brazil, Colombia, USA, Australia and Japan. All species could readily be separated using classic taxonomic criteria, in particular ascospore and asexual morphology.          *[Table 1.

    "abstract": "*[This dissertation investigates causes & effects of agricultural intensification on the structure & function of ant assemblages in coffee plantations & forest patches of Andean Colombia.  Coffee intensification significantly reduced vegetation complexity & increased management index values, as measured from 14 habitat variables.  Using a leaf-litter sampling protocol, I found that less intensely managed coffee farms harbored significantly higher ant species richness.  Ant communities in polygeneric shaded coffee were significantly more similar to forest patches than any other management type.  Additionally, significant positive associations among ant communities & the number of species involved in ant mosaics dropped sharply with intensification.  I carried out nesting resource augmentation experiments to examine how the quantity & quality of nesting resources affect ant biodiversity.  Ants responded quickly to the addition of nesting resources across the intensification gradient.  In the quality resources experiment, the diversity of ants nesting in multi-species groups of twigs was significantly higher than in mono-specific groups across all scales.  These results suggest that bottom-up mechanisms are important for ant species loss throughout the intensification process, although other biotic & abiotic factors such as microhabitat & competition might also play a role.  Finally, ant predation in shaded vs. unshaded coffee plantations was studied in the field & laboratory.  Exclosure experiments demonstrated that ant communities prey on the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) in both shaded & unshaded coffee plantations, but this function increased with shade in the wet season, when most infestation takes place.  Predation in the field fluctuated between 2%-27% of borer adults.  My studies strongly support the conclusion that the structure & function of ant biodiversity are negatively affected by intensification of coffee agriculture.          *[Acanthognathus teledectus misspelled Acanthognatus teledectus; Acanthostichus misspelled Acantostychus; Eciton burchellii misspelled Eciton burchelli; Odontomachus erythrocephalus misspelled Odontomachys erythrocephalus; Solenopsis (Diplorhoptrum) misspelled Solenopsis diplorrhoptum; Cerapachyinae misspelled Cerapahyinae.]",

    "abstract": "A pattern noted in ecology is that diversity at one level begets diversity at other levels. In the case of consumers competing for similar resources, the diversity of those resources is thought to provide some degree of niche diversification in which a diverse set of consumer species can coexist. If, however, the diverse resources are not sufficiently distinct from one another, from the standpoint of the consumer species, such niche diversification will not exist. We experimentally show that a diverse array of twigs attracted 80% more species of twig-nesting ants than a monospecific collection of twigs.

    "abstract": "*[We studied the structure & organization of small foraging groups, in an attempt to understand the process through which the cohesiveness of the moving file is maintained.  The recruited group moves in a single file, as if steered by a leader at the moving tip.  Ants in the group were found to exhibit certain fidelity to their respective positions in the file, despite the occasional breakdown of the cohesiveness due to disturbance and/or obstructions on their path.  This fidelity decreases from both ends towards the middle part of the file.  Accordingly, 3 segments could be recognized in the moving file: (a) the leading ant that almost always maintains its position & steers the group, (b) a short tail part with a few ants that always trail the file &, (c) the mid part that binds the group.  Ants in this segment always tend to follow the leader through a cascading chain of tactile communication.  If the leader ant is removed, entire group loses its orientation & enters into a chaotic search state.  But removing any other ant does not affect the cohesiveness, rather it's position is occupied by the member preceding it, thus maintaining the link in the group.  The cohesiveness of the moving group appeared to result from (a) regulation of the movement of the group by the leading ant, &, (b) an interactive process among the rest of the ants.  Based on these 2 elements, a simple automated model of the group's movement was developed that could effectively mimic the observed pattern.  We also provide evidence to suggest that recruitment of groups occurs in the direction of resource rich patches, & in response to, the information received by the colony.]",

To understand the universality of the phenomena revealed in H. saltator, biological studies of closely related species are important. We investigated the nest architecture and colony reproductive structure of Harpegnathos venator at two sites in northern Thailand. Nests had chimney-like entrances with a funnel diameter of about 3 cm and consisted of two or three chambers, the floors of which were flat and smooth. The floors and walls inside the chambers were decorated with several small fragments of cocoons, which has been referred to as \u001cwall-papering\u001d. Most colonies included one or more mated dealate queens that laid eggs, whereas only a few mated workers reproduced in the queenright colonies. In our sampling, virgin dealate queens were found in several colonies, but there were very few queenless colonies that reproduced by mated workers. Additional colonies collected from three other sites in Thailand also had dealate queens. The H. venator colonies reproduced mainly by mated queens, although many mated workers were present. The nest architecture of H. venator was similar to that of H. saltator, but the colony reproductive structure was different: queen colonies of H. saltator are always monogynous, and queenless colonies that reproduce by gamergates are frequently found. Furthermore, virgin dealate queens are never found in H. saltator. Factors affecting these differences between the two congeneric species are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Chloroxylon swietenia DC. (Rutaceae) is widely used in folk medicine and provides a commercial timber. In the present study, phenological events such as flowering and fruiting phenology, pollinator visitation, anthesis, pollen viability, and pollen tube germination tests were analyzed in 11 populations, in Tamil Nadu, India. The number of flowers was recorded as 82.6 ± 1.4 to 162.2 ± 4.2 during flower bud formation and reduced to 25.4 ± 0.5 to 61.8 ± 1.0 at maturity. The number of fruits per twig was 21.0 ± 0.8 to 47.2 ± 0.7 in initial stages and slightly reduced to 16.2 ± 1.8 to 34.6 ± 1.4 at maturation. Sixty-two species of insects were visiting the flowers with bees/ants as effective pollinators. The 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay revealed more viable pollen grains in five populations, and fluorescence dye assay revealed maximum viable pollen grains in six populations. In the pollen tube germination test, the 60% sucrose concentration provides significant results, with a high number of germinated pollen grains.

    "abstract": "*[Ants & seeds show a variety of interactions, from generalist seed harvesters to more selective elaiosome-eating ants.  Seed harvesting by ants is an interaction typical of non-forested systems from mid & low latitudes.  Most aspects of the foraging strategy of harvester ants can be interpreted as a time-saving policy.  Ants take advantage of the limited periods of time in which activity outside the nest is feasible to collect as many seeds as possible, using in many cases a trunk trail system to access to the foraging patches.  This voracious strategy inflicts severe seed losses to certain plant species.  However, harvester ants also behave as accidental seed dispersers (dyszoochory) by dropping or mislaying seeds in foraging areas, foraging trails, chaff piles; & granary chambers.  The alteration of local microsite conditions caused by harvester ants can be beneficial for the dispersed seeds.  In contrast to the less-discerning seed harvesters, some seed-feeding ants behave as true gourmets.  Myrmecochory is an interaction that requires selective ants to collect elaiosome-bearing seeds & disperse them after consuming the elaiosome.  Ants obtain nutritional benefits from myrmecochory, valuable in quality rather than in quantity.  Plants can benefit from an increase in dispersal distance, predator avoidance, reduction of kinship among seeds & arrival to favorable microsites.  The interaction can be vital for plants, & is highly dependent on the ant species that collects the diaspore.  A third type of interaction involving seeds & ants is diplochory.  In this case, seeds experience 2 phases of dispersal, usually a combination of a coarse & a fine event.  Ants can participate in diplochory by collecting coarsely dispersed seeds & transporting them to favorable microsites.  Many diplochorous plants offer a reward for frugivores in the form of fruit pulp, as well as a reward for ants in the form of an elaiosome.  In other cases, the seeds can be secondarily dispersed by dyszoochory rather than by myrmecochory.]          [NOTE: S. saevissima is S. invicta or S. richteri in North America.]",

Neighbor-joining trees inferred from 647 bp of Cytb and 1,026 bp of COI using Oecophylla longinoda as an outgroup indicated that the haplotypes of O. smaragdina were clearly separated into seven groups: group 1 of India excluding West Bengal; group 2 of Bengal, Indochinese Peninsula, Malay Peninsula and Greater Sunda Islands, including Lombok and Sumbawa; group 3 of the Philippines; group 4 of Flores; group 5 of Sulawesi; group 6 of Halmahera; and group 7 of New Guinea and Australia. This grouping was also supported by a strict consensus tree derived from maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood trees. In addition, two haplotypes of LW Rh were found in O. smaragdina: one in group 2 and another in all the other groups.

We explored the organisation of the AL in the ant Oecophylla smaragdina through Golgi analysis and other standard histological procedures. Six topographically distinct glomerular clusters were noticed in the AL. AL volume, total number of glomeruli and its spatial organisation were different in the castes of Oecophylla smaragdina. We could count 220 glomeruli in the AL of the major worker, whereas only 140 glomeruli were located in AL of minor workers. LNs with their cell body located on the dorsal, dorso-lateral, ventral, ventro-lateral, and medial position of the AL were characterised. Most of the LNs are oligoglomerular. Uniglomerular and multiglomerular PNs were also identified. The results underline a caste specific organisation of the AL in Oecophylla smaragdina. The characterised LNs and PNs further reveals the complex neural circuitry involved in the processing of important chemical cues related to the lifestyle of the ant.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how biodiversity is distributed is increasingly becoming important under ongoing and projected human land use. Measures of beta diversity, and its partitions, can offer insights for conservation and restoration of biodiversity. We ask how different species, functional groups, and land use contribute to beta diversity, and whether invasive species have a negative influence on beta diversity. We address these questions using ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) at 277 sites distributed across five geomorphic land use types in Goa, India. We recorded 68 species (35 genera, 7 subfamilies) of which 5 were invasive. We classified them into eight functional groups. Oecophylla smaragdina\u0014a common tropical arboreal species, and Anoplolepis gracilepis\u0014a globally significant invasive, contributed the most to beta diversity. Large\u0010bodied omnivores which may influence soil functions contributed more to beta diversity than small\u0010bodied predators. Lateritic plateaus contributed most to beta diversity, whereas human\u0010influenced plantations contributed the least. Beta diversity across sites was related to species turnover, whereas nestedness was more prominent for functional groups. This indicates how species replace one another with change in land use, but functional roles are lost despite such turnover. Sites with human land use had higher incidence of invasive species, and invaded sites contributed less to beta diversity than non\u0010invaded sites. Human land use strongly influences diversity and distribution of ant assemblages. Land use may spare local species richness, but not functional groups. A small number of invasive species exert negative influence even in very speciose communities.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions are open to exploitation by one or other of the partners and a diversity of other organisms, and hence are best understood as being embedded in a complex network of biotic interactions. Figs participate in an obligate mutualism in that figs are dependent on agaonid fig wasps for pollination and the wasps are dependent on fig ovules for brood sites. Ants are common insect predators and abundant in tropical forests. Ants have been recorded on approximately 11% of fig species, including all six subgenera, and often affect the fig-fig pollinator interaction through their predation of either pollinating and parasitic wasps. On monoecious figs, ants are often associated with hemipterans, whereas in dioecious figs ants predominantly prey on fig wasps. A few fig species are true myrmecophytes, with domatia or food rewards for ants, and in at least one species this is linked to predation of parasitic fig wasps. Ants also play a role in dispersal of fig seeds and may be particularly important for hemi-epiphytic species, which require high quality establishment microsites in the canopy. The intersection between the fig-fig pollinator and ant-plant systems promises to provide fertile ground for understanding mutualistic interactions within the context of complex interaction networks.",

    "abstract": "When postulating evolutionary hypotheses for diverse groups of taxa using molecular data, there is a tradeoff between sampling large numbers of taxa with a few Sanger\u0010sequenced genes or sampling fewer taxa with hundreds to thousands of next\u0010generation\u0010sequenced genes. High taxon sampling enables the testing of evolutionary hypotheses that are sensitive to sampling bias (i.e. dating, biogeography and diversification analyses), whereas high character sampling improves resolution of critical nodes. In a group of ant parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Eucharitidae: Oraseminae), we analyse both of these types of datasets independently (203 taxa with five Sanger loci, 92 taxa with 348 anchored hybrid enrichment loci) and in combination (229 taxa, 353 loci) to explore divergence dating, biogeography, host relationships and differential rates of diversification. Oraseminae specialize as parasitoids of the immature stages of ants in the subfamily Myrmicinae (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), with ants in the genus Pheidole being their most common and presumed ancestral host. A general assumption is that the distribution of the parasite must be limited by any range contraction or expansion of its host. Recent studies support a single New World to Old World dispersal pattern for Pheidole at c. 11-27\tMa. Using multiple phylogenetic inference methods (parsimony, maximum likelihood, dated Bayesian and coalescent analyses), we provide a robust phylogeny showing that Oraseminae dispersed in the opposite direction, from Old World to New World, c. 24-33\tMa, which implies that they existed in the Old World before their presumed ancestral hosts. Their dispersal into the New World appears to have promoted an increased diversification rate. Both the host and parasitoid show single unidirectional dispersals in accordance with the presence of the Beringian Land Bridge during the Oligocene, a time when the changing northern climate probably limited the dispersal ability of such tropically adapted groups.          *[Ant species listed from Table S1: Oraseminae ant and plant host records.]",

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization is a growing threat to biodiversity, causing wide-scale extirpation of species from their natural habitats. Some species such as rock agamas, Psammophilus dorsalis, seem to be sufficiently tolerant and continue to persist in urban environments. Given that urbanization alters species composition at multiple trophic levels, we expect a shift in the diet composition and hunting modes of populations across rural and urban areas. Based on identified contents from stomach flushes, we found that P. dorsalis are generally myrmecophagous, and their diet is mainly composed of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Diet of males and females in each area overlapped highly (80-91%), even though males were significantly larger than females. Dietary overlap between urban and rural populations also was high (80.3%). Surprisingly, rural lizards had lower body mass indices than did urban lizards, despite the greater diversity of prey types and the larger volume of food consumed. This species uses a sit-and-wait hunting strategy, but we found that the rate of movement of males was higher in rural areas compared to urban areas, which likely results in higher energy expenditure. Individuals of P. dorsalis do not seem to be negatively affected by urbanization but instead manage to hunt in and around the small patches of vegetation that remain, enabling them to maintain a higher body condition than that of lizards in undisturbed rural habitats.",

    "abstract": "33 species are recognized in the ant subfamily Leptanillinae. 17 of them are based on workers and 16 on unassociated males. The workers are grouped into the single genus Leptanilla Emery (= Leptomesites Kutter, syn. nov.) which includes the following species: L. revelierei Emery (= L. doderoi Emery, syn. nov.) from S. France, Corsica, Sardinia and N. Africa. The three intraspecific forms attributed to this species can be separated from the typical form and one from each other on consistent morphological grounds but they have been not formally synonymized because of the high number of male-based and morphologically divergent species coming from the same area and which should at least in aprt correspond to the worker-based forms.  L. theryi Forel from Algerie and Tunisia. L. kubotai n. sp. from Japan. L. morimotoi Yasumatsu from Japan. L. buddhista n. sp. from Nepal. L. besucheti n. sp. from Sri Lanka. L. oceanica n. sp. from Ogasawara Is. L. havilandi Forel from Singapore. L. tahi n. sp. from Thailand. L. butteli Forel from Malaysia. L. swani Wheeler from Australia. L. tanakai n. sp. from Japan. L. escheri (Kutter) from S. India. L. vaucheri Emery from Morocco. L. boltoni n. sp. from Ghana. L. nana Santschi from Tunisia.  The males are only partly reviewed because it has not been possible to examine all the known species. It is underlined, moreover, that some of these males could be extraneous to the Leptanillinae and even to the Formicidae, although their placement within the Leptanillinae seems to represent the most reasonable solution for the moment. 11 species in 4 genera result from literature and 5 additional species are recognized in the present paper. Only 3 of them, of particular zoogeographical interest, are described, that is: L. africana n. sp. from Nigeria, L. australis n. sp. from S. Africa and L. islamica n. sp. from Aden. Two others from Spain and Tunisia respectively, are briefly described but not named because of the intriguing status of the previously known Mediterranean species.  A particular emphasis is given to the discovery of L. oceanica on the Ogasawara Islands. To explain this record we are forced to admit the capacity of long distance dispersal for Leptanilla, an assumption which reproposes the problem af the previously supposed antiquity of these ants and of their consequently low evolutionary rate.",

Moreover, two new exotic species of particular interest are described: A. pertinax n. sp., taken at 2200 m altitude in the Darjeeling district (India), which represents the northern record for the genus in central Asia and the highest altitudinal record for the genus as a whole.  This species shows no morphological relationships with other Indian species, but is comparable with A. minuta (Forel) from Sumatra.  A. besucheti n. sp. is described from the island La Digue in the Seychelles.  This is the smallest known species in the genus and it shows no considerable affinities with other species.  It is regarded as a palaeoendemic, also in view of the fact that no Amblyopone species are known to occur in central and South Africa and Madagascar, a situation contrasting with the high species concentration in the Indoaustralian area.",

    "abstract": "The traditional hypothesis that ant soldiers originate from large size workers is rejected in favour of their direct origin from gynes. This conclusion is supported by the first report of soldiers smaller than workers, by an intercaste morphometric comparative analysis by means of D'Arcy Thompson's transformation grids and by phylogenetic studies on Cephalotes showing that the cephalic shield appeared ancestrally among soldiers and only later among gynes. The same conclusion flows from facts already known but hitherto misunderstood and stressed in this paper such as: 1) there are species of Cephalotes with soldiers with incomplete cephalic shield and no gyne shield and other species with complete soldier shield but only incomplete gyne shield; 2) the phragmotic behaviour is exercised by workers and soldiers and not by gynes but its morphological correlate, i.e., the shield-shaped head, occurs among soldiers and gynes and not in workers. These observations prove that the selection pressure for the shield morphology acts on workers and soldiers and not on gynes but its morphological correlate actually appears first in soldiers, later in gynes and never in workers. These data sharply contrast with a worker origin of soldiers and are perfectly consistent with the hypothesis of a separate origin of soldiers directly from gynes.",

    "abstract": "The higher phylogeny of the Formicidae was analyzed using 68 characters and 19 taxa: the 14 currently recognized ant subfamilies plus 5 potentially critical infrasubfamilial taxa.  The results justified the recognition of 3 additional subfamilies: Aenictogitoninae Ashmead (new status), Apomyrminae Dlussky & Fedoseeva (new status), and Leptanilloidinae Bolton (new subfamily).  A second analysis of these better delimited 17 subfamilies resulted in 24 equally most parsimonious trees.  All trees showed a basal division of extant Formicidae into two groups, the first containing (Myrmicinae, Pseudomyrmecinae, Nothomyrmeciinae, Myrmeciinae, Formicinae, Dolichoderinae, Aneuretinae) and the second the remaining subfamilies.  Clades appearing within these groups included the Cerapachyinae plus 'army ants', the Nothomyrmeciinae plus Myrmeciinae, the 'formicoid' subfamilies (Aneuretinae + Dolichoderinae + Formicinae), and the Old World army ants (Aenictinae + Aenictogitoninae + Dorylinae), but relationships within the last two groups were not resolved, and the relative positions of the Apomyrminae, Leptanillinae and Ponerinae remained ambiguous.  Moreover, a bootstrap  analysis produced a consensus tree in which all branches were represented in proportions much lower than 95%.  A reconstruction of the ground plan of the Formicidae indicated that the most specialized of all recent ants are the members of the subfamily Dorylinae and the least specialized ones are the monotypic Apomyrminae.",

    "abstract": "*[The Indian ant Harpegnathos saltator may be unique among insects in using its jumping capacity not only as an escape mechanism, but also as a normal means of locomotion, & for catching its prey in flight.  High-speed cinematography used to analyse the various phases of the jump suggests that Harpegnathos employs a novel jumping mechanism to mediate these behaviors: namely the synchronous activation of its middle & hindlegs.  Electrophysiological recordings from muscles or nerves in pairs of middle & hindlegs show remarkably synchronous activity during fictive jumping, supporting the synchronous activation hypothesis.  Harpegnathos is not the only ant to jump, & a cladistic analysis suggests that jumping behaviour evolved independently 3 times during ant evolutionary history.]",

    "abstract": "Measurements of head width of 2,068 workers from a single colony of Pheidologeton diversus (Jerdon) collected in south India, allowed a clear grouping of the population into three major subcastes. The size limit of head width for each subcaste and its relative frequency are as follows: minor workers (0.56 - 1.00 mm; 90.48%); medium workers (1.00 - 3.12 mm; 7.54%); major workers (3.12 - 5.20 mm; 1.98%). The boundary between the contiguous subcastes is well marked by strong reductions of frequency or total absence of intermediate individuals belonging to the critical size groups. Polynomial regressions have been used to analyze the allometry between different body parts between a representative subset of 88 workers fitting the whole variability range of the population. The following measurements have been taken: head length, head width, scapus length and length of the posterior tibia. The results show triphasic allometry between scapus and tibia length; tetraphasic allometry between head length and head width, between scapus and head length, and between scapus length and head width; pentaphasic allometry between tibia length and head width and between tibia and head length.  These results represent the first records of pentaphasic allometry in ants and some of the few records of allometry of a degree higher than triphasic among animals, although this is probably partly due to the use of less ensitive analytical methods in most of the previous literature. Our results entirely confirm a former suggestion by van Boven (1970) that the length of the tibia, when compared with some cephalic measurements, shows the hignest degree of allometry in ants.",

Time taken to cover the distance from the nest to the food source and back was 4 to 112 min and 1 to 78 min respectively.  More time taken by the foragers to cover the distance from the nest to the food source was due to spending time in search of food source.  Longest paths were observed in February to May summer months, and the shortest during June to September rainy months.  The length of the foraging paths were directly proportional to the availability of food nearby the nest area.]",

However, in several populations from south India, referred to as 'nilgiri', gamergates do not mutilate their nestmates, but monopolize reproduction using dominance interactions.  Various lines of evidence indicate that 'nilgiri' populations are closely related to the neighboring species D. ceylonense.  To determine whether this important behavioural difference between 'nilgiri' & D. ceylonense is associated with significant genetic differentiation, we have used microsatellite & mitochondrial markers to examine genetic variation within & between 'nilgiri' & D. ceylonense.  We found a very high genetic differentiation between the 2 forms, which suggests a lack of gene flow.  There was an unexpected pattern of mitochondrial variation, because all 'nilgiri' populations show identical or very closely related COII sequences, except one population with a very different haplotype.  This divergent haplotype is genetically much more distant from the other 'nilgiri' haplotypes than are D. ceylonense haplotypes.]",

Of the more than 800 scutacarid species that have been described so far, about the half of them can be found together with various animal taxa.  Scutacarid species can be phoretic using their hosts for dispersal, they can be inquilines of their hosts benefiting from favourable conditions in the hosts' nests, or they can be both.  The highest number of scutacarid species, (n = 214) is associated with ants.  The most frequent genera Archidispus, Imparipes, & Scutacarus show host preferences: Scutacarus & Imparipes tend to prefer ants, while Archidispus prefers beetles.

    "abstract": "Paussus, commonly known as ant nest beetles, is the most diverse genus of Paussinae (Coleoptera: Carabidae) with a very complex taxonomic history. Biodiversity research in Southeast and South Asia yields new species that can contribute to a better understanding of the morphological disparity and species-group or subgenus delimitation. Here, we describe nine new species from Southeast Asia and China: Paussus (Scaphipaussus) fencli sp. nov. (China), P. (S.) mawdsleyi sp. nov. (Borneo), P. (S.) bakeri sp. nov. (Philippines), P. (S.) jendeki sp. nov. (Laos), P. (S.) saueri sp. nov. (India), P. (S.) annamensis sp. nov. (Vietnam), P. (S.) phoupanensis sp. nov. (Laos, Vietnam), P. (S.) bilyi sp. nov. (Thailand), and P. (S.) haucki sp. nov. (Thailand). We also bring new data on P. (S.) corporaali Reichensperger, 1927 (Java) and P. (S.) madurensis Wasmann, 1913 (India). Besides formal descriptions, we provide photographs of the habitus in the dorsal and dorsolateral view, antennal club, head crest, and male genitalia if the male is available. Based on the comparison of new and earlier described species, we show that the antennae are highly diverse within the Scaphipaussus. Considering other characters, some species are placed in Scaphipaussus, but they differ from putative relatives in the antennal morphology. The presence of the frontal protuberances and crests is a more reliable character. Additional species show that Scaphipaussus is most diverse in southeastern Asia, especially in Indo-Burma. Concerning its supposed late Miocene origin, the group underwent rapid radiation. The species diversity of Scaphipaussus almost doubled in the last decade, and it is highly probable that further species will be described in the future.          *[Some previously recorded species of Scaphipaussus were collected from ant nests, mainly of the genus Pheidole Westwood, 1839, e.g., Pheidole ghatica Forel, 1902; P. javana Mayr, 1867,  P. latinota Roger, 1863; P.pallidula (Nylander, 1849); P. plagiaria Smith, 1860; & P. wroughtoni, Forel, 1902.",

The ants were found to be active foragers, scavengers, & predators prevalent in the vicinity of several horticultural plantations & crops.  The workers ants preyed on many insect species & fed on nectar exudates from plants as well as sticky secretions produced by Homopteran & Lepidopteran insects.  Results of this study revealed that O. smaragdina attacked a number of species of aphids, mealy bug, lepidopteran larvae, & a few beetles.  It consumed 100% sucking pests tested such as Green stink bug, Chinavia hilaris & hibiscus mealy bug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus & moderately consumed different species of aphids, i.e., oleander aphid, Aphis nerii (71.2%), Aonla aphid, Setaphis bougainvilleae (71%), Cowpea aphid, Aphis Craccivora (62.5%), Mustard aphid, Lipaphis erysimi (72.5%), Cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (70.4%), & 67% of chrysanthamum aphid, Macrosiphoniella sanborni, whereas, gundhi bug (0%) was not preferred for their feeding, perhaps due to the unpleasant odor, emitted by the bug.  Other than sucking pests, O. smaragdina highly preyed on larvae of lemon butterfly, Papilio demoleus (100%), chickpea pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (100%), rice horn caterpillar, Melanitis leda ismene (100%), & while a lesser feeding preference was seen in case of tobacco cut worm larvae, Spodoptera litura (72%), red pumpkin beetle, Raphidopalpa foveicollis (70%), fall army worm larvae, Spodoptera frugiperda (68%), & in leaf defoliator larvae, Euproctis spp. (54%) consumption was noticed.  Tussock moth larvae, Lymantriidae (0.00%), Bihar hairy caterpillar larvae, Spilosoma oblique (0.00%) were not at all since preferred probably due to the presence of hairs /setae on their body.]",

The species in question is a relic of old fauna & closely resembles the primitive M. ritae-group species.  A detailed description of the 3 larval instars of Myrmica inezae Forel, 1902 is provided.  The ist larvae exhibit aphaenogastroid body profile.  The 2nd & 3rd larvae exhibit pheidoloid body profile, but is pogonomyrmecoid in the previously reported larval stages of genus Myrmica Latreille, 1804.  M. inezae differs from the earlier described larval stages of M. rugosa & M. rupestris (rugosa-group) based on number of occipital hairs (6 in M. inezae as compared to 8 in M. hecate & M. rupestris); mandibular teeth (2 in M. inezae as compared to one in M. hecate & M. rupestris), & shape of maxilla (conoidal in M. inezae as compared to paraboloidal in M. hecate & M. rupestris).]",

    "abstract": "*[The Northern-Indian Shivalik mountain range has recently come under strong anthropogenic pressure.  Ants were used as bioindicators to assess ecosystem health of the area.  We measured diversity, community patterns, species composition, & the influence of invasive species of ants by collecting at 75 sites from 44 locations in 3 habitats: primary forest, secondary forest, & non-forest areas using 6 collection techniques.  We obtained the most comprehensive dataset compiled for Indian ants to date (sample coverage 94 % to 97 %) & sampled 31,487 ant specimens, representing 181 species from 59 genera & 9 ant families.  Thirty of the 59 genera were represented by a single species, 12 genera by more than 5 species, & 26 species were new to science.  Species richness differed significantly between habitats, with 151 in secondary forest, 120 in primary forest, & 110 in non-forest areas.  Species richness rose with altitude & was influenced by precipitation, northern latitude, & eastern longitude.  As demonstrated by redundancy analysis & beta diversity, habitats also differed in species composition.  Nineteen invasive/tramp species, comprising ca. 13% of total abundance, were distributed among the 3 habitats (including primary forest).  Our findings point towards a disrupted, degraded ecosystem with high anthropogenic impact & reduced ecosystem health, even in the primary & protected forest areas.  Invasive species pose a serious threat to the native species of Himalaya.  At present the ant invasions are limited to lower mountain ranges, but with increases in global temperatures invasive species will soon spread to Himalayan highlands.]",

However, much work remains to document and catalogue the species of India and their geographic distributions, especially for diverse invertebrate groups. In the present study, a comprehensive and critical list of Indian ant species is provided with up-to-date state-wise distribution. A total of 828 valid species and subspecies names belonging to 100 genera are listed from India. Potential erroneous data, misidentifications and dubious distributional records that may exist in the literature are also identified. The present exhaustive listing of Indian ants will provide a holistic view about diversity and distribution and will also help to identify major undersampled areas where future sampling and taxonomic efforts should be directed.          *[NOTE: This identification needs to be confirmed.  India would be a significant range extension for the invasive species Solenopsis invicta.]          *[This Solenopsis invicta record is listed as dubious by https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Solenopsis_invicta  checked 7 Sept. 2019.]",

Among insects, especially ants, relatively few observations have been formalized about the morphology of immature stages. Using light and scanning electron microscopy, this study presents the first description of the different larval instars of Aphaenogaster cristata (Forel, 1902) and Aphaenogaster pachei (Forel, 1906), species endemic to the Himalayas that predominate in areas where cold temperature stress and disturbances limit the presence of other ants. The existence of four larval instars was estimated based on the frequency distribution of their measured maximum head widths. We observed discrete alterations in the body constitution and parts among the different instars, suggesting they must follow similar habits until pupation. The two species, however, present noticeable particularities in their mandibles and hair types, suggesting intrinsic life adaptations. Observed traits complementary with previous descriptions with larvae of the genus and related taxa are suggestive of considerable evolutionary distance from Messor, considered the sister clade, which merits further taxonomic investigation in future studies.",

The pattern observed could be attributed to the optimal climatic conditions present at mid-altitude.

    "abstract": "Understanding a species' reproductive biology, which encompasses floral biology, pollination biology, and breeding system, is necessary for the restoration of endangered plant species. Buchanania lanzan is a vulnerable evergreen tree in IUCN Red Data Book due to excessive deforestation and over-exploitation. Light and scanning electron microscopy and histochemical analysis were used to study floral and pollination biology. Experiments were conducted to study floral and pollination biology, including pollen viability, stigma receptivity, and pollen-pistil interactions. Bisexual, pentamerous, complete yellowish-white flowers have an annual growth of 11 months and are arranged in terminal and axillary panicles. Anthers dehisce between 10.30 and noon, 9-10 hours after anthesis. Stigmas were receptive at the time of anther dehiscence and remained receptive for two days. The flowers contain sucrose-rich nectar and emit a mild scent to attract visitors, including Musca domestica, Apis cerena indica, and black ants. None of these visitors appeared to be an effective pollinator. The results of pollination trials showed that the species outcrosses with low levels of selfing. Cross-pollinated flowers had a higher percentage of fruit sets (74.4%) compared to self-pollinated (43.4%) and open (3%). The index of self-incompatibility (ISI) indicates partial self-incompatibility. Due to the probable loss of pollinators or the lack of efficient pollinators, the natural population of B. lanzan has not yet been restored. To achieve the required fruit or seed set cross-pollination facilitated by humans would be a feasible technique. Therefore, to prevent the extinction of this species, human management is required in terms of cross-pollination. As a result, the scientific knowledge produced by the current study may prove helpful in various breeding initiatives and the preservation of this medicinal plant species. Further, this knowledge forms the basis for taking measures for the conservation and management of forests.",

    "abstract": "1. Nest mounds are an integral part of many subterranean insect species, and they aid in thermoregulation, gaseous exchange, and flood prevention. Ants living in subterranean nests are prone to nest flooding particularly during monsoons and this will impact the colonies' fitness. 2. Diacamma indicum is a tropical Ponerine ant species that lives in simple, single\u0010chambered nests with a single entrance. In this study, we characterised the mound architecture and performed field experiments to check functional significance of mounds. 3. On examining mound architecture (n = 19 nests), we found that mounds not only elevated the nest entrance by 3.39\tcm on average, but they also made the entrance at the top of the mound significantly smaller than the nest entrance at the base of the mound. Both these features are likely to reduce rainwater from falling directly into the nest's entrance tunnel. 4. Upon performing partial (n = 18 nests) and complete destruction (n = 20 nests) in two different seasons, colonies were observed to actively rebuilt mounds to pre\u0010destruction levels within 3\tdays in all cases. 5. Furthermore, examining the amount of water that entered the nest upon flooding in the presence and absence of mounds (n = 18 colonies) revealed that mounds prevented a minimum of 29.2% of water from seeping into the nest from the surrounding area, as mounds could act as a levee. This study highlights the active architectural adaptations to flooding by an organism that dwells in subterranean nests in a tropical habitat.",

    "abstract": "*[We hypothesized that environmental perturbations around Douala have repercussions on the native litter-dwelling ants.  Collections conducted in 33 houses, six gardens of 225 m2 each, 41 plantations of one hectare each, & 34 2-year old fallows of one hectare each suggested lowly even communities, low species richness, low diversity, & low dominance by a few species.  Among 28 species recorded, 5 species were most common: 2 foreign origin species [S. geminata (Fabricius, 1804) & Trichomyrmex destructor (Jerdon, 1851), from tropical America & India respectively], one native species [Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius, 1793)] & 2 ambiguous native range species [Paratrechina longicornis (Latreille, 1802) & Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius, 1793)] (since they have long been recorded as having a widespread distribution).  Alien species were more highly represented than native ones (52.9% & 47.1% respectively).  Inside houses, gardens, & plantations, the ant species were distributed according to the geometrical progression (Motomura's model), while in the old fallows, abundance distribution suggested an evolved ecosystem (Mandelbrot's model).  Between the 3 dominant species, Pa. longicornis, Ph. megacephala, & S. geminata, the first species was positively correlated with the third one ,while other associations were not significant.  These dominant species appeared to be influencing the abundance of the rare species.  Dominance & high abundance of a few species indicated, that areas were influenced mostly by interspecies competition and/or disturbance by human activities.]          *[Anochetus katonae & Odontomachus troglodytes incorrectly listed in Formicinae; they are Ponerinae.]",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effects of various insect species, such as those of Bombyx mori, Hermetia illucens and Tenebrio monitor, that have long been used in combination with medicinal plants and are an important alternative to modern medicine in many parts of the world. The current use of traditional pesticides from around the year 2010 and the characteristics of isolated biologically active molecules are also presented. Natural insect products were examined or isolated from ants, bees, beetles, cockroaches, termites, bees, etc. The biological activities of these natural products derived from insects include antimicrobial, antifungal, anticancer, antiviral, antioxidant and anti\u0010inflammatory effects. Insect additives to animal feed rarely distort the relevant physicochemical variables or sensory profile of the meat, whereas the fatty acid (FA) profile is discernibly changed. In fact, insect derivatives have great potential for future drug discovery in natural products, as well as for the production of nutritious foods for humans and for animals. It is concluded that the inoculation of insect powder in animal feeds results in the prevention and treatment of disease, enhances the growth of animals and promotes the bioactive compounds in animal\u0010based products. Owing to the sustainability of their breeding, large\u0010scale cultures of these insects seem economically viable. Insect oil and protein as well as chitin ingredients are widely used in cosmetics, and these substances are considered high\u0010value co\u0010products. The major challenges associated with their use will be linked to the development of methods for separating industrial\u0010derived materials.",

    "abstract": "This study unravels the evolution and biogeographic history of the globally distributed ant genus Crematogaster on the basis of a molecular phylogeny, reconstructed from five nuclear protein-coding genes and a total of 3384 bp of sequence data. A particular emphasis is placed on the evolutionary history of these ants in the Malagasy region. Bayesian and likelihood analyses performed on a dataset of 124 Crematogaster ingroup taxa lend strong support for three deeply diverging phylogenetic lineages within the genus: the Orthocrema clade, the Global Crematogaster clade and the Australo-Asian Crematogaster clade. The 15 previous subgenera within Crematogaster are mostly not monophyletic. Divergence dating analyses and ancestral range reconstructions suggest that Crematogaster evolved in South-East Asia in the mid-Eocene (40-45 ma). The three major lineages also originated in this region in the late Oligocene/early Miocene (~24-30 ma). A first dispersal out of S-E Asia by an Orthocrema lineage is supported for 22-30 ma to the Afrotropical region. Successive dispersal events out of S-E Asia began in the early, and continued throughout the late Miocene. The global distribution of Crematogaster was achieved by subsequent colonizations of all major biogeographic regions by the Orthocrema and the Global Crematogaster clade. Molecular dating estimates and ancestral range evolution are discussed in the light of palaeogeographic changes in the S-E Asian region and an evolving ocean circulation system throughout the Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene. Eight dispersal events to/from Madagascar by Crematogaster are supported, with most events occurring in the late Miocene to Pliocene (5.0-9.5 ma). These results suggest that Crematogaster ants possess exceptional dispersal and colonization abilities, and emphasize the need for detailed investigations of traits that have contributed to the global evolutionary success of these ants.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are becoming more prevalent due to the rise of global trade and expansion of urban areas. Ants are among the most prolific invaders with many exhibiting a multiqueen colony structure, dependent colony foundation and reduced internest aggression. Although these characteristics are generally associated with the invasions of exotic ants, they may also facilitate the spread of native ants into novel habitats. Native to diverse habitats across North America, the odorous house ant Tapinoma sessile has become abundant in urban environments throughout the United States. Natural colonies typically have a small workforce, inhabit a single nest, and are headed by a single queen, whereas urban colonies tend to be several orders of magnitude larger, inhabit multiple nests (i.e., polydomy) and are headed by multiple queens (i.e., polygyny). Here, we explore and compare the population genetic and breeding structure of T. sessile within and between urban and natural environments in several localities across its distribution range. We found the social structure of a colony to be a plastic trait in both habitats, although extreme polygyny was confined to urban habitats. Additionally, polydomous colonies were only present in urban habitats, suggesting T. sessile can only achieve supercoloniality within urbanized areas. Finally, we identified strong differentiation between urban and natural populations in each locality and continent\u0010wide, indicating cities may restrict gene flow and exert intense selection pressure. Overall, our study highlights urbanization's influence in charting the evolutionary course for species.",

We experimentally induced conflicts by splitting each colony into 2 groups, a control group containing the gamergate and an orphaned group displaying aggressions until a new dominant worker arises.  Immunocompetence was assessed by the clearance of Escherichia coli bacteria that we injected into the ants.  Time budget analysis revealed a lower rate of labor and especially brood care in orphaned groups, supporting the existence of a cost of conflicts on labor.  Fifteen days after splitting, a lower immunocompetence was also found in orphaned groups, which included workers involved and not involved in conflicts.

Here it is shown that M. sahlbergi , like M. pharaonis , is found worldwide, almost certainly as a result of introductions. Including quarantine interceptions, this species is recorded from seven global biogeographic regions, but its established outdoor distribution is currently limited to the tropics and subtropics.

A heli-baiting operation in 2002 used high concentration fipronil (at 0.1 g/kg at 4 kg/ha) to eradicate all targeted supercolonies.  However, supercolonies began to steadily redevelop across the island.  We conducted surveys over the entire island from May to September 2009 & located 74 separate supercolonies that covered 833 ha.  The boundary of each supercolony was mapped precisely by ground truthing.  Two thirds of this area was too inaccessible & dangerous to be baited using standard hand-baiting techniques.  So in September 2009, we heli-baited 785 ha of supercolonies (with the remaining 48 ha intentionally not baited), using 3,294 kg of ant bait, but this time using one tenth of the previous concentration of fipronil (0.01 g/kg at 4 kg/ha).  All targeted supercolonies were again controlled, with ant activity reduced by 98.4% 4-weeks after baiting, & remained reduced by 99.4% 20-weeks after baiting.  Direct non-target impacts of the baiting were minimal.]",

    "abstract": "A review is presented of the 13 genera currently taken to constitute the Solenopsis-group, which is redefined here. The genus-group in the sense of this paper includes three former groups, the Monomorium-, Megalomyrmex-, and Solenopsis-groups, combined. Extensive modifications to the genera formerly included in the first of these are proposed, including the new synonymy of Syllophopsis Santschi and Chelaner Emery under Monomorium Mayr, the reinstatement of Phacota Roger and Bondroitia Forel as valid genera, and the exclusion of Hagioxenus Forel from the group. The genera Tranopelta Mayr and Ochetomyrmex Mayr (= Brownidris Kusnezov) are newly excluded from the group and the previous provisional synonym of Monomorium, Xenoaphaenogaster Baroni Urbani, is transferred out of the group and newly synonymized with Pheidole Westwood. One new genus, Epelysidris, is described from Borneo.  The status of Diplorhoptrum Mayr as a separate genus is considered and rejected and a key to recognized genera is presented. Treatment of individual genera varies from a short review of current knowledge to a redefinition and revision of some smaller genera (Anillomyrma Emery, Bondroitia Forel, Diplomorium Mayr). The very large genus Monomorium is reviewed and redefined on a world-wide basis and its extensive genus-level synonymy is discussed in detail. The former genera and subgenera now synonymized with Monomorium are fitted into a system of informal species-groups which are defined and discussed on a world-wide basis. A new name is proposed for the type-species of Monomorium, which is preoccupied, and the authorship and publication date of M. antarcticum (Smith) is investigated. The large Afrotropical fauna of Monomorium is fully revised and keyed, and contains 145 species in 8 species-groups. The latter are keyed separately and only two species- groups are confined to the Afrotropical region. Of the 145 species currently recognized as valid, 46 are described as new in this paper and 35 are newly elevated to species-rank from former infraspecific status; 43 new species-level synonyms are proposed, mostly of former infraspecific forms.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ant societies comprise individuals belonging to different castes characterized by specialized morphologies and behaviors. Because ant embryos can follow different developmental trajectories, epigenetic mechanisms must play a role in caste determination. Ants have a full set of DNA methyltransferases and their genomes contain methylcytosine. To determine the relationship between DNA methylation and phenotypic plasticity in ants, we obtained and compared the genome-wide methylomes of different castes and developmental stages of Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator.  Results:  In the ant genomes, methylcytosines are found both in symmetric CG dinucleotides (CpG) and non-CpG contexts and are strongly enriched at exons of active genes. Changes in exonic DNA methylation correlate with alternative splicing events such as exon skipping and alternative splice site selection. Several genes exhibit caste-specific and developmental changes in DNA methylation that are conserved between the two species, including genes involved in reproduction, telomere maintenance, and noncoding RNA metabolism. Several loci are methylated and expressed monoallelically, and in some cases, the choice of methylated allele depends on the caste.  Conclusions:  These first ant methylomes and their intra- and interspecies comparison reveal an exonic methylation pattern that points to a connection between DNA methylation and splicing. The presence of monoallelic DNA methylation and the methylation of non-CpG sites in all samples suggest roles in genome regulation in these social insects, including the intriguing possibility of parental or caste-specific genomic imprinting.",

    "abstract": "The organized societies of ants include short-lived worker castes displaying specialized behavior and morphology and long-lived queens dedicated to reproduction. We sequenced and compared the genomes of two socially divergent ant species: Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator. Both genomes contained high amounts of CpG, despite the presence of DNA methylation, which in non-Hymenoptera correlates with CpG depletion. Comparison of gene expression in different castes identified up-regulation of telomerase and sirtuin deacetylases in longer-lived H. saltator reproductives, caste-specific expression of microRNAs and SMYD histone methyltransferases, and differential regulation of genes implicated in neuronal function and chemical communication.

    "abstract": "Northeast India is amongst the 34 Biodiversity Hot Spots of the world with large number of unexplored flora and fauna. A total of 74 potential isolates with probiotic properties were isolated from Oecophylla smaragdina, an edible insect used by local tribes as a nutritious medicinal food source out of which, the most potential probiotic candidate was identified as Bacillus sp. PD6 by 16S rRNA sequencing. Cell surface trait analysis shows hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation percentage of 46.2\t±\t0.32% and 61.41\t±\t0.28% respectively. The cell free extract (CFE) of the isolate shows the presence of essential amino acids viz, lysine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, and threonine indicating its nutritional value. It survives significantly at pH range from 1 to 10 and capable of hydrolyzing bile salt. The CFE shows antagonistic effect against B. cereus ATCC 11778, E. coli ATCC 25922 and L. monocytogenes ATCC BAA751. FTIR spectra of bacterial exo-polysaccharide shows the presence of ΩCåC\u0013H õúcëúcï, ΩN\u0013H õúcëúcï, ΩC\u0013H õúcëúcï, ΩC\u0013H bëôdbôg and ΩCåO õúcëúcï bonds.

We examined the response of male ant-mimicking salticid spiders of the genus Myrmarachne and of five different color forms to retreat and dragline silks of sympatric females of six color forms to determine whether silk-based cues could be used as pre-mating isolation mechanisms and aid species determination. We found evidence for polymorphism within one species Myrmarachne plataleoides, a well-known mimic of the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina. Male color morphs of this species showed cross-interest in female silks of other color morphs of this species, but also exhibited greatest preference for the silk of their own color morph, providing evidence for assortative mating and the possibility of silk-based cues as mechanisms of incipient speciation via disruptive selection. Males of two other color forms exhibited unambiguous preference for the silk of their own color forms, suggesting that these two forms are distinct species. The silk-based findings were confirmed by no-choice mating experiments and opportunistic observations of natural matings.",

    "abstract": "The generic classification of the ant subfamily Dorylinae is revised, with the aim of facilitating identification of easily-diagnosable monophyletic genera. The new classification is based on recent molecular phylogenetic evidence and a critical reappraisal of doryline morphology. New keys and diagnoses based on workers and males are provided, along with reviews of natural history and phylogenetic relationships, distribution maps, and a list of valid species for each lineage. Twenty-eight genera (27 extant and 1 extinct) are recognized within the subfamily, an increase from 20 in the previous classification scheme. Species classified in the polyphyletic Cerapachys and Sphinctomyrmex prior to this publication are here distributed among 9 and 3 different genera, respectively. Amyrmex and Asphinctanilloides are synonymized under Leptanilloides and the currently recognized subgenera are synonymized for Dorylus . No tribal classification is proposed for the subfamily, but several apparently monophyletic genus-groups are discussed. Valid generic names recognized here include: Acanthostichus (= Ctenopyga), Aenictogiton, Aenictus (= Paraenictus, Typhlatta), Cerapachys (= Ceratopachys), Cheliomyrmex, Chrysapace gen. rev., Cylindromyrmex (= Holcoponera , Hypocylindromyrmex , Metacylindromyrmex), Dorylus (= Alaopone syn. n., Anomma syn. n., Cosmaecetes, Dichthadia syn. n., Rhogmus syn. n., Shuckardia, Sphecomyrmex, Sphegomyrmex, Typhlopone syn. n.), Eburopone gen. n., Eciton (= Camptognatha, Holopone, Mayromyrmex), Eusphinctus gen. rev., Labidus (= Nycteresia , Pseudodichthadia), Leptanilloides (= Amyrmex syn. n., Asphinctanilloides syn. n.), Lioponera gen. rev.

    "abstract": "The mutualistic interspecific relationships of trophobiosis between trophobiont planthoppers (Hemiptera, Fulgoromorpha) providing food to the host called xenobiont, are reviewed. The degree of interspecific relationships between these symbionts varies from occasional or short time duration (a few hours to a few days) to longer ones, with trophobionts left free to escape (optobiotic type) by the xenobiont, or maintained enclosed in nests or ant shelters (cryptobiotic type). Of 267 collected cases, 126 are new illustrated observations. Occasional trophobiosis is documented in 13 families of planthoppers and appears to be quite general in Fulgoromorpha, although it is reported for the first time for Dictyopharidae, Eurybrachidae, and Nogodinidae. Xenobionts associated with planthoppers are reported from ants and other Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Blattodea, but also from Mollusca and even small gekkonid vertebrates. Tettigometridae appear to be exclusively tended by ants, while Fulgoridae significantly more often by cockroaches (40%) than by ants (27%). Long-time trophobiosis occurs always with ants, cryptobiotic ones reported in Cixiidae, Delphacidae, Tettigometridae, Meenoplidae, Flatidae and Hypochthonellidae, while optobiotic ones remain restricted to tettigometrids. A particular focus on Tettigometridae attended by ants is provided with new etho-ecological observations of 92 currently described tettigometrids species, 32 different species (35%) are now known to be able to be ant-attended. In Bulgaria, where fourteen species occur, trophobiosis occurs with at least five species of them (36%). In tettigometrids, subsociality, sessility, and underground life appear to be key factors allowing more complex relationships with ants. However, the planthopper size and thus the amount of food (drops of honeydew) is probably also an important factor. This might explain many new observations in large-sized and often isolated fulgorids with cockroaches. Tapping of trophobiont forewings by cockroaches, moths, or of the bark subtrate by geckos has been observed, but antennal palpation behaviours by ants are the most commonly observed with tettigometrids, although not with larger planthoppers. In tettigometrids, specific tegumentary glands secretions (allomones) of the abdomen pleurites might also mediate their long-term mutualistic associations, even possibly completing honeydew kairomones actions mediating planthopper trophobiosis in general.",

    "abstract": "The genus Stenamma Westwood comprises a group of cryptic, cold tolerant ants that occur throughout the Holarctic and Middle American regions. Traditional approaches to taxonomy and phylogeny are confounded by multiple factors, including the conservative and often convergent morphology of workers and the rarity of reproductive castes in collections. Monophyly of Stenamma and relationships within the genus are uncertain as nearly all previous taxonomic work has been regional in scope. Furthermore, the sister group to Stenamma has not been well established. Here an extensive molecular dataset consisting of ten genes (~8 kb of data), 48 ingroup taxa (20 Nearctic, 6 Palaearctic and 22 Neotropical) and 8 outgroup taxa (6 closely related non-Stenamma and 2 additional myrmicines) is used to investigate the broad-scale phylogeny and evolutionary history of Stenamma. Phylogenetic analysis is performed under maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks on individual genes and several alternate concatenated datasets, which are used to investigate the effects of inclusion or exclusion of COI and intronic regions. The timing of Stenamma evolution is inferred in beast and ancestral areas are reconstructed using both the s-diva and DEC methods, as implemented in the programs rasp and lagrange, respectively. Stenamma is revealed as monophyletic with high support and tentatively is sister to a group of New World species placed currently in Aphaenogaster Mayr and Messor Forel. Within Stenamma, two major clades are recovered: a 'Holarctic clade' (HOC) and a 'Middle American clade' (MAC). The HOC consists of the European S. striatulum Emery sister to two well-supported groups, the informal 'debile' and 'brevicorne' clades. The 'brevicorne' clade is entirely Nearctic, whereas the 'debile' clade includes both Nearctic and Palaearctic representatives. The MAC occurs from the southern United States to northern South America and, with the exception of S. huachucanum Smith, is almost completely isolated geographically from the HOC. It includes a depauperate northern clade and the 'MAC core', which is a diverse assemblage of wet forest adapted species found throughout Central America. Divergence dating and biogeographic reconstruction show that Stenamma is most likely to have originated in the Nearctic at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (~35 Ma) and diversified more rapidly at 16 and 8 Ma for the HOC and MAC, respectively. Potential environmental factors affecting the evolution of Stenamma include the intense global cooling of the late Eocene combined with aridification and mountain building. The phylogenetic results are discussed in relation to the current Stenamma species groups and several new morphological characters are presented to help in identification.",

    "abstract": "Aim:  The standard latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), in which species richness decreases from equator to pole, is a pervasive pattern observed in most organisms. Some lineages, however, exhibit inverse LDGs. Seemingly problematic, documenting and studying contrarian groups can advance understanding of LDGs generally. Here, we identify one such contrarian clade and use a historical approach to evaluate alternative hypotheses that might explain the group's atypical diversity pattern. We focus on the biogeographical conservatism hypothesis (BCH) and the diversification rate hypothesis (DRH).  Location:  Global.  Taxon:  Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Stenammini).  Methods:  We examined the shape of the LDG in Stenammini by plotting latitudinal midpoints for all extant, described species. We inferred a robust genome-scale phylogeny using UCE data. We estimated divergence dates using beast2 and tested several biogeographical models in BioGeoBEARS. To examine diversification rates and test for a correlation between rate and latitude, we used the programs BAMM and STRAPP, respectively.  Results:  Stenammini has a skewed inverse LDG with a richness peak in the northern temperate zone. Phylogenomic analyses revealed five major clades and several instances of non-monophyly among genera (Goniomma, Aphaenogaster). Stenammini and all its major lineages arose in the northern temperate zone. The tribe originated ~51 Ma during a climatic optimum and then diversified and dispersed southward as global climate cooled. Stenammini invaded the tropics at least seven times, but these events occurred more recently and were not linked with increased diversification. There is evidence for a diversification rate increase in Holarctic Aphaenogaster + Messor, but we found no significant correlation between latitude and diversification rate generally.  Main Conclusions:  Our results largely support the BCH as an explanation for the inverse latitudinal gradient in Stenammini. The clade originated in the Holarctic and likely became more diverse there due to center-of-origin, time-for-speciation and niche conservatism effects, rather than latitudinal differences in diversification rate.

    "abstract": "The morphology of organisms relates to most aspects of their life history and autecology. As such, elucidating the drivers of morphological variation along environmental gradients might give insight into processes limiting species distributions. In eusocial organisms, the concept of morphology is more complex than in solitary organisms. Eusocial insects such as ants exhibit drastic morphological differences between reproductive and worker castes. How environmental selection operates on the morphology of each caste, and whether caste\u0010specific selection has fitness consequences is largely unknown, but is potentially crucial to understand what limits ant species' distributions. Here we aimed to examine whether ant shape and body size covaries with climate at the scale of an entire continent, and whether such relationship might be caste specific. We used 26,472 georeferenced morphometric measurements from 2,206 individual ants belonging to 32 closely related North American species in the genus Formica to assess how ant morphology relates to geographic variation in the abiotic environment. Although precipitation and seasonality explained some of the geographic variation in morphology, temperature was the best predictor. Specifically, geographic variation in body size was positively related to temperature, meaning that ants are smaller in cold than in warm environments. Moreover, the strength of the relationship between size and temperature was stronger for the reproductive castes (i.e. queens and males) than for the worker caste. The shape of workers and males also varied along these large\u0010scale abiotic gradients. Specifically, the relative length of workers' legs, thoraxes and antennae positively related to temperature, meaning that they had shorter appendages in cold environments. In contrast, males had smaller heads, but larger thoraxes in more seasonal environments. Overall, our results suggest that geographic variation in ambient temperature influences the morphology of ants, but that the strength of this effect is caste specific. In conclusion, whereas ant ecology has traditionally focused on workers, our study shows that considering the ecology of the reproductive castes is imperative to move forward in this field.",

Despite economic and ecological impact of pest ants, effective management still faces many challenges and control failures with liquid spray insecticides are common. The odorous house ant (Tapinoma sessile Say) is an adaptive and widespread pest ant found in North America. This study examined regional variation in T. sessile insecticide susceptibility to three classes of insecticides commonly used in ant control. T. sessile showed significant regional variation in insecticide susceptibility on a relatively small geographic scale. A comparison of colonies collected in urban vs. natural areas showed no significant difference in susceptibility in tests with lambda\u0010cyhalothrin and fipronil. In tests with dinotefuran, urban colonies were significantly more tolerant relative to natural colonies. These results suggest that habitat type and previous insecticide exposure do not reliably predict susceptibility levels in individual populations. Queens were significantly more tolerant relative to their worker counterparts across all insecticides. Higher insecticide tolerance in queens may explain why T. sessile is such a persistent pest in urban environments. The results provide a foundation for the development of more effective and efficient control methods for T. sessile and warrant further investigation of spatial and potentially temporal variability in insecticide susceptibility in ants.",

    "abstract": "Disturbance resulting from urbanization is a leading cause of biotic homogenization worldwide. Native species are replaced with widespread non-native species and ants are among the world's most notorious invaders. To date, all documented cases of ant invasions involve exotic introduced species that are spread around the world by human-mediated dispersal. I investigated the effect of urbanization on the evolution of invasive characteristics in a native ant species, the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say). Colony social structure, life history traits, and the spatial pattern of nest distribution were compared by sampling T. sessile across a gradient of three distinct habitats: natural, semi-natural, and urban. Results demonstrate a remarkable transition in colony social and spatial structure and life history traits between natural and urban environments. In natural habitats, T. sessile colonies are comprised of small, monogyne (single queen), and monodomous (single nest) colonies. In urban areas, T. sessile often exhibit extreme polygyny and polydomy, form large supercolonies, and become a dominant pest. Results also suggest that urban T. sessile colonies may have a negative impact on native ant abundance and diversity. In the natural environment T. sessile coexisted with a wide array of other ant species, while very few ant species were present in the urban environment invaded by T. sessile. Habitat degradation and urbanization can lead to extreme changes in social and spatial colony structure and life history traits in a native ant species and can promote the evolution of invasive characteristics such as polygyny, polydomy, and supercolonial colony structure.",

    "abstract": "1. In social insects, the number of nests that a colony inhabits may have important consequences for colony genetic structure, the number of queens, sex allocation, foraging efficiency, and nestmate recognition. Within the ants, colonies may either occupy a single nest (monodomy) or may be organised into a complex network of nests and trails, a condition known as polydomy.  2. The current study is a large-scale, long-term, comprehensive field examination of various features of colony social and spatial structure in the facultatively polydomous black carpenter ant, Camponotus pennsylvanicus (DeGeer). The study examined the density, persistence, and the spatiotemporal distribution of colonies across a gradient of land disturbance associated with urban development. The temporal and spatial pattern of nest use was compared between fragmented landscapes where nesting sites were interspersed among human-built structures (urban plots) and less disturbed landscapes with higher tree density (suburban plots). In addition, nesting site fidelity and changes in colony spatial structure were monitored over 7 years.  3. Long-term monitoring and extensive sampling over a large spatial area allowed the first comprehensive insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of colony and population structure in C. pennsylvanicus. A total of 1113 trees were inspected over 233 ha. Camponotus pennsylvanicus were active on 348 of the 1113 trees (31%) and these represented 182 distinct colonies. The colonisation rate remained relatively stable over 7 years suggesting that an equilibrium point had been reached. Relative to the suburban plots, tree density was 65% lower in the urban plots. The proportion of trees colonised by C. pennsylvanicus was significantly higher in the urban plots suggesting that intraspecific competition for nesting sites may be especially high in areas with lower tree density. Colony spatial structure also differed significantly between habitats and a higher incidence of monodomy was observed in the urban environment. The average number of trees per colony across all subplots was 1.95 (range 1-4) indicating that C. pennsylvanicus are weakly polydomous.  4. The composite picture that emerges for C. pennsylvanicus colonies in the urban habitat is a chain reaction of events: (i) the urban habitat has a lower tree density, (ii) lower tree density results in higher tree colonisation rate, (iii) higher tree colonisation rate results in simpler colony spatial structure (i.e. higher incidence of monodomy), and (iv) simpler colony spatial structure results in numerically smaller colonies. Long-term monitoring of the spatiotemporal pattern of nest site use in selected colonies revealed a unique trend. While worker counts in selected colonies remained relatively stable throughout the course of the study, colony spatial structure changed considerably with 28% of colonies experiencing a change. Furthermore, the likelihood of detecting a change in colony spatial structure increased with the amount of time passing from the initial inspection.  5. In conclusion, tree density has a significant effect on a number of important colony features in C. pennsylvanicus. Besides tree density, other environmental features such as human-built structures cause habitat fragmentation and may act as natural barriers to worker dispersal and/or foraging. Such barriers may ultimately affect the social and/or spatial structure at both the colony and the population level.",

    "abstract": "Eusocial insects often live in colonies comprised of an extensive network of interconnected nests and estimating colony spatial structure and colony boundaries may be difficult, especially in cryptic, subterranean species. A combination of aggression assays and protein marking was used to estimate nest spatial distribution in field populations of the highly polydomous cornfield ant, Lasius neoniger. The estimates were first obtained via 1-on-1 aggression tests for workers collected from different nests within the research plots. The aggression tests were followed by mark-recapture field studies which utilized rabbit IgG protein. The ants were allowed to self-mark by feeding on sucrose solution spiked with the IgG protein. Colony spatial structure was detected by sampling ants from different nests and analyzing them for the presence of the marker using an ELISA test. Estimates based on aggression tests were substantially higher relative to those based on protein marking. The average colony size based on aggression tests was 2.0 +- 0.2 m2 and was significantly higher than the 1.1 +- 0.4 m2 estimate based on protein marking. The estimate based on protein marking was even lower, 0.2 +- 0.1 m2, when a Fluon-coated ring restricted ant feeding to the focal nest and prevented ants from other nests from feeding on the protein-marked sucrose. No significant correlation was detected between internest aggression and internest distance. Likewise, no correlation was detected between distance from the focal nest and the percentage of workers testing positive for the protein marker. The results show that both approaches have their own limitations, but their simultaneous use allows for a more accurate assessment of colony spatial structure. The advantages and limitations of each technique are discussed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Horizontal insecticide transfer is thought to play an important role in controlling a wide range of urban pests including ants, bed bugs, cockroaches, and termites. Despite decades of research and numerous laboratory studies, horizontal transfer has never been demonstrated in the field. As a result, the importance of horizontal transfer (and the resulting secondary kill) for practical pest management remains unknown. The goal of this study was to provide the first experimental examination of horizontal transfer under field conditions. The specific objective was to investigate horizontal transfer of fipronil in field colonies of black carpenter ants, Camponotus pennsylvanicus. RESULTS: Laboratory experiments demonstrated that fipronil is effectively transferred from treated donors to untreated recipients and causes significant secondary mortality. Fipronil was effectively vectored to untreated ants from donors exposed via residual and direct spray applications, and 100% mortality was achieved with both exposure routes. Furthermore, horizontal transfer continued beyond secondary mortality and resulted in significant tertiary mortality, which has not been previously demonstrated in ants. Field experiments utilized a novel, three\u0010step control method consisting of trap\u0013treat\u0013release and demonstrated that fipronil is effectively transferred when foraging workers are trapped, treated, and subsequently released back into their colonies. CONCLUSION: The current study is the first field demonstration of the importance of horizontal transfer for the control of pest ants. The trap\u0013treat\u0013release method may be an effective alternative to broadcast spray applications and could help alleviate problems such as insecticide run\u0010off, environmental contamination, and non\u0010target effects. This method has the potential to provide effective management of invasive and pest ants and should be further tested across a wider range of ant species, habitats, and active ingredients. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",

    "abstract": "Invasive ants are a significant pest around the world and have negative impact on natural and agricultural environments. Chemical control is mainly accomplished with residual sprays and toxic baits. Hydrogel baits are a novel bait formulation that has proven highly effective against multiple invasive ant species, but potential non\u0010target effects have not been investigated. The baits are typically saturated in 25% sucrose solution which makes them attractive to foraging ants and potentially non\u0010target organisms such as pollinators. The objective of the current study was to perform field studies to assess the potential attractiveness of hydrogel baits to various pollinating and non\u0010pollinating arthropods in a variety of ecosystems, including tallgrass prairies, urban pollinator gardens, and commercial apiaries. The study focused on social Hymenoptera as pesticides are acutely toxic to various Hymenoptera and have been implicated as one of the contributing factors in pollinator declines. Results show that Diptera were overwhelmingly the most common visitors and accounted for >40% of all visitors. Other common groups included beetles and yellowjackets. Common pollinating insects such as honeybees, solitary bees, and butterflies rarely visited the baits and accounted for ca. 3% of all visits and were never found on ground baits. Results show that the risk to pollinators is relatively low; most arthropods attracted to the baits were taxa that are extremely abundant, not of conservation concern, and in some cases pestiferous or invasive. The deployment of hydrogels for invasive ant control in areas where multiple invasive insect taxa are present may have the additional benefit of controlling multiple pests.          *[The study focused specifically on non-target (non-ant) visitors & the presence of ants was not recorded.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many ant species are pests in urban, agricultural, and natural habitats around the world. The primary means of reducing or eliminating ant infestations utilizes chemical control, mainly applications of residual insecticides. Control failures with residual insecticides are common, driven in part by a lack of understanding of basic biological and life history characteristics, including interspecific variation in susceptibility to insecticides. The current study evaluated the susceptibility of 12 species of urban pest ants to three classes of insecticides. RESULTS: Results show significant variation in susceptibility across species. Contrary to the hypothesis of proportionality, no significant relationship was detected between body mass and median lethal time (LTÖÄ) or time to 100% mortality. The odorous house ant (Tapinoma sessile) was consistently the least susceptible to all insecticides, as indicated by the highest LTÖÄ values and the greatest amount of time required to reach 100% mortality. Comparatively low susceptibility to commonly used spray insecticides may explain why T. sessile is such a persistent pest. Broadcast applications of spray insecticides may kill off the most susceptible species, leaving behind T. sessile. Lack of competition from other ant species, combined with increased access to nesting and feeding resources may allow T. sessile to fill a vacant ecological niche and expand its range. CONCLUSION: Considering T. sessile's relatively low susceptibility to insecticides, its ability to become established in areas colonized by other invasive ants, and its highly invasive behaviors, it should be watched for by biosecurity programs as it has high potential to become a globally invasive pest. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "abstract": "Subterranean termites provide a major potential food source for forest-dwelling ants, yet the interactions between ants and termites are seldom investigated largely due to the cryptic nature of both the predator and the prey. We used protein marking (rabbit immunoglobin protein, IgG) and double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) to examine the trophic interactions between the woodland ant, Aphaenogaster rudis (Emery) and the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar). We marked the prey by feeding the termites paper treated with a solution of rabbit immunoglobin protein (IgG). Subsequently, we offered live, IgG-fed termites to ant colonies and monitored the intracolony distribution of IgG-marked prey. Laboratory experiments on the distribution of protein-marked termite prey in colonies of A. rudis revealed that all castes and developmental stages receive termite prey within 24 h. In field experiments, live, protein-marked termites were offered to foraging ants. Following predation, the marker was recovered from the ants, demonstrating that A. rudis preys on R. flavipes under field conditions. Our results provide a unique picture of the trophic-level interactions between predatory ants and subterranean termites. Furthermore, we show that protein markers are highly suitable to track trophic interactions between predators and prey, especially when observing elusive animals with cryptic food-web ecology.",

    "abstract": "1. The odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile, is a native ant species common throughout North America. In its natural habitat, T. sessile is a low-key species that consists of small colonies. In invaded urban areas, T. sessile exhibits extreme polygyny and polydomy and becomes a dominant invasive pest. 2. The current study examined: (i) the density, persistence, and the spatial distribution of nests in a large supercolony of T. sessile, (ii) trail abundance and overall colony connectivity as facilitated by the network of trails, (iii) the abundance and the spatial distribution of competing ant species, and (iv) the effect of environmental factors on the number and distribution of T. sessile nests. 3. A distinct pattern of seasonal polydomy was observed, whereby the colony undergoes an annual fission-fusion cycle. The colony occupies one or a few nests during the winter, experiences rapid exponential growth in the spring to colonize available nesting sites, reaches maximum nest density in the summer, and again coalesces in the winter, returning to the same winter location year after year. The trails show spatio-temporal variation as well, depending on the location of nesting and foraging sites. Furthermore, nest movements may be driven by soil microclimate and proximity to man-made structures. 4. In total, 119 ant nests were discovered in a 3.15 ha plot, 90 (76%) of which belonged to T. sessile. Tapinoma sessile exhibited strong colony connectivity as 78/90 (87%) of nests were connected to at least one other nest by a trail. Mean persistence time for T. sessile nests was 133 +- 5 days. 5. Results indicate that T. sessile is a highly adaptable native ant species that exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its colony social structure. A high degree of polygyny and polydomy may contribute to its ecological dominance and pest status in urban environments.",

    "abstract": "Predation pressure from ants is a major driving force in the adaptive evolution of termite defense strategies and termites have evolved elaborate chemical and physical defenses to protect themselves against ants. We examined predator-prey interactions between the woodland ant, Aphaenogaster rudis (Emery) and the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar), two sympatric species widely distributed throughout deciduous forests in eastern North America. To examine the behavioral interactions between A. rudis and R. flavipes we used a series of laboratory behavioral assays and predation experiments where A. rudis and R. flavipes could interact individually or in groups. One-on-one aggression tests revealed that R. flavipes are vulnerable to predation by A. rudis when individual termite workers or soldiers are exposed to ant attacks in open dishes and 100% of termite workers and soldiers died, even though the soldiers were significantly more aggressive towards the ants. The results of predation experiments where larger ant and termite colony fragments interacted provide experimental evidence for the importance of physical barriers for termite colony defense. In experiments where the termites nested within artificial nests (sand-filled containers), A. rudis was aggressive at invading termite nests and inflicted 100% mortality on the termites. In contrast, termite mortality was comparable to controls when termite colonies nested in natural nests comprised of wood blocks. Our results highlight the importance of physical barriers in termite colony defense and suggest that under natural field conditions termites may be less susceptible to attacks by ants when they nest in solid wood, which may offer more structural protection than sand alone.",

    "abstract": "Stomodeal trophallaxis plays a major role in ant colony nutrition and communication. While the rate of food distribution at the individual level (worker to worker) is rapid, factors affecting the rate of food distribution at the colony level remain poorly understood. We used the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say), as a model species to investigate the factors affecting the rate of spread of liquid carbohydrate food throughout a colony. To track the movement of the food we used protein marking and double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, DAS-ELISA. Increasing colony size while keeping the number of donor workers constant significantly decreased the number of individuals testing positive for the marker. After 8 h of trophallactic interactions with ten donors, 92 +- 5% of recipient workers tested positive in a colony of 125 and 38 +- 5% tested positive in a colony of 1,000. Interestingly, as colony size increased and the percentage of workers testing positive decreased, the proportion of workers actually receiving food increased. Food originating from a single donor fed approximately 12 individuals in colonies comprised of 125 recipients and approximately 38 individuals in colonies comprised of 1,000 recipients. Thus, the per capita consumption of food decreased as colony size increased, most likely because the amount of food reaching the colony was limited. Increasing the number of donors while keeping colony size constant significantly increased the number of recipient ants testing positive for the marker. As the number of donor workers doubled, the percentage of recipients testing positive more than doubled suggesting that the number of individuals receiving food increases with increasing colony size, while the per capita amount of food decreases. When food was available ad libitum and in close proximity to the nest, numerous workers fed directly at the food source. This dramatically increased the rate and the extent of food distribution to both the workers and the queens and colony size had no significant effect on the spread of the marker in the workers or the queens. The rate and the extent of food distribution at the colony level may depend on a number of factors including the number of successful foragers, the size and density of the recipient colony, and the recipient caste.",

    "abstract": "To advance our understanding of the causes and the consequences of budding (colony multiplication by fragmentation of main nests), we investigated nest movement in the facultatively polydomous Pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis. Demographic data revealed that Pharaoh ants are highly polygynous and have a relatively low worker to queen ratio of 12.86. Budding experiments demonstrated that the number of available bud nests has a significant effect on colony fragmentation and increasing the number of bud nests resulted in smaller colony fragments. The overall distribution among bud nests was uneven, even though there was no evidence that the different life stages and castes partitioned unevenly among the bud nests and the analysis of individual colonies revealed no evidence of an uneven split in any of the colonies. This demonstrates that Pharaoh ants have the ability to exert social control over colony size and caste proportions during budding, which may contribute to their success as an invasive ant. The intensity of nest disturbance had a significant effect on whether or not the ants migrated into bud nests. Major disturbance resulted in the ants abandoning the source nest and migrating to bud nests and minor disturbance did not stimulate the ants to abandon the source nest. The results of the successive budding experiment which allowed the ants the opportunity to bud into progressively smaller nest fragments demonstrate that Pharaoh ants maintain a preferred minimum group size of 469 +- 28 individuals. Food allocation experiments utilizing protein marking revealed that nest fragmentation in Pharaoh ants has no negative impact on intracolony food distribution. Overall, our results suggest that nest units in the Pharaoh ant behave like cooperative, rather than competitive, entities. Such cooperation is most likely facilitated by the fact that individuals in all bud nests are genetically related, remain in close proximity to each other, and may continue to exchange individuals after budding.",

The mechanisms by which Argentine ants effectively compete against native ant species have been previously addressed in field studies that centered on interference and exploitation competition at baits and mainly examined the colony-level performance of Argentine ants. Detailed behavioral observations explaining the basis for the strong competitive ability of L. humile are comparatively rare. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which Argentine ants displace native ants we examined the aggressive interactions between the Argentine ants and the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile in four different aggression assays: (1) worker dyad interactions, (2) symmetrical group interactions, (3) intruder introductions into an established resident colony, and (4) a resource competition assay which focused on competition for food and nesting space. Our results demonstrate a clear disparity between worker-level and colony-level fighting ability of Argentine ants and provide behavioral evidence to explain the superior interference ability of Argentine ants in group assays. Argentine ants experienced mixed success in fighting against odorous house ants in dyad interactions, but gradually gained a numerical advantage in symmetrical group interactions by active cooperation among nestmates. Results of the resource competition assay indicate that Argentine ants recruit rapidly, numerically dominate food and nesting sites, and aggressively displace T. sessile from baits. Taken together, the results of these assays allow us to pinpoint the behavioral mechanisms responsible for the remarkable competitive ability of Argentine ants.",

We tested both repellent and nonrepellent formulations on outdoor (concrete and mulch) and indoor (ceramic and vinyl) substrates. Repellency was evaluated using a behavioral bioassay in which colonies were given a choice to leave the treated zone and move into empty nests provided in the untreated zone. We used a novel experimental design whereby ants walked on a Slinky coil suspended from a metal support frame, thus permitting a long foraging distance with a minimum use of space and resources. Cypermethrin, a repellent pyrethroid insecticide, resulted in colony budding, although the response was delayed. Toxicity of insecticides was evaluated as worker, queen, and brood mortality. The most effective treatment was fipronil, which provided 100% reduction in pretreatment activity by 2 d posttreatment on both concrete and mulch. Chlorfenapyr was highly effective on both outdoor and indoor substrates. Significant substrate effects were observed with insecticides applied to nonabsorbent substrates (ceramic tile), which performed better than insecticides applied to absorbent substrates (vinyl tile). Other highly absorbent materials (mulch and concrete), however, did not reduce insecticide efficacy. This is because ants relocated nests into and/or under these attractive nesting materials, thus increasing their exposure to toxic insecticide residues. Our results demonstrate efficacy of nonrepellent liquid insecticides as indoor treatments for the control of Pharaoh ants and possibly as exterior perimeter treatments.",

Aggression assays demonstrated high levels of aggression in pairings involving workers from different urban colonies & workers from different natural colonies, but low aggression in pairings involving queens from different urban colonies.  Colony merging tests demonstrated that urban T. sessile colonies are highly aggressive to each other, but capable of fusing under laboratory conditions when competing for limited nesting and food resources.  Despite highly aggressive interactions & relatively high worker & queen mortality, all colony pairs merged in 3-5 days.  Fusion occurred after most workers died and the survivors merged.

    "abstract": "Twelve genera of Oraseminae (Hymenoptera: Eucharitidae) are recognized in the Old World. The genus Orasema is now considered as found only in the New World, and the Old World species, previously treated as species groups, are now treated as distinct genera.

    "abstract": "*[Forty-five colonies of Temnothorax curvispinosus (Mayr, 1866) containing the rare inquiline ant T. minutissimus (Smith, 1942) were collected near Bloomington, Indiana, USA.  The colonies were censused & some were kept in laboratory culture.  Dealate & alate females of T. curvispinosus & T. minutissimus were dissected.  The parasite females have a total of 6 ovarioles.  Both, T. minutissimus & the host species, are facultatively polygynous, & the parasite is host-queen tolerant.  Alate males were found in August & September.  High numbers of alate & dealate, mated but not yet reproductive, young females of T. minutissimus were present in colonies collected in early spring, a feature which had been known as 'Intranidal Mated Offspring Hibernation'.  Mated young queens of T. minutissimus seem to disperse in spring to invade host colonies.  Apparently, they are accepted quite easily by host colonies.  Rearing of colonies collected in the early spring, or hibernated in the laboratory, yielded first a brood of sexuals of T. curvispinosus, & subsequently considerable numbers of gyne pupae of T. minutissimus appeared.  Only very few males were produced, sex ratio was about 0.1 males/females.  Intranidal mating attempts were observed, & newly mated young females were detected in colonies having reared gynes & males of T. minutissimus.  Life history of the species is a novel combination of traits found in different other parasitic ant species, intranidal mating and IMOH as in a few European 'degenerate slavemakers' of the genus Myrmoxenus, but the parasite is host-queen tolerant, as is the case in 2 of the 3 European inquiline species of Leptothorax (former Doronomyrmex).  The development of the parasites after the host species sexuals is a novel trait.  The male of T. minutissimus is described.  It is characterized by a reduced number of antennomeres (9-11 instead of 12), and a certain 'morphological feminization'.]",

    "abstract": "1. Ants establish mutualistic interactions involving a wide range of protective relationships (myrmecophily), in which they provide defence against enemies and partners provide food rewards and/or refuge. Although similar in the general outcome, myrmecophilic interactions differ in some characteristics such as quantity and quality of rewards offered by partners which may lead to different specialisation levels and, consequently, to different network properties. 2. The aim of this study was to identify structural patterns in myrmecophilic interaction networks, focusing on aspects related to specialisation: network modularity, nestedness and taxonomic relatedness of interaction ranges. To achieve this, a database of networks was compiled, including the following interactions: ants and domatia-bearing plants (myrmecophytes); ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants (EFNs); ants and floral nectary-bearing plants (FNs); ants and Lepidoptera caterpillars; and ants and Hemiptera. 3. Myrmecophilic networks differed in their topology, with ant-myrmecophyte and ant-Lepidoptera networks being similar in their structural properties. A continuum was found, ranging from highly modular networks and phylogenetically structured interaction ranges in ant-myrmecophyte followed by ant-Lepidoptera networks to low modularity and taxonomically unrelated interaction ranges in ant-Hemiptera, EFN and FN networks. 4. These results suggest that different network topologies may be found across communities of species with similar interaction types, but also, that similar network topologies can be achieved through different mechanisms such as those between ants and myrmecophytes or Lepidoptera larvae. This study contributes to a generalisation of myrmecophilic network patterns and a better understanding of the relationship between specialisation and network topology.",

Occasionally, when a dead tree was found swarming with black ants, he would crush some of the ants & give them to him to eat as a medicinally beneficial tidbit in the spring.  Gabriel Polchis (another Malechite Indian) also indulged in this delicacy.  In connection with the medicinal properties of ants we learn some striking points.  The London Pharmacopaeia of 1696 reveals. \"Ants are hot & dry; excite lust, & by their sharp scent wonderfully refresh the spirit: the greater, or winged, with a little salt, cure the psora, or scab, & leprosie.\"  Savarof, once addressing the Russian Soldiers, told them to \"have a dread of the hospital!German Physic stinks from afar; is good for nothing & rather hurtful; but take care of your health; a soldier is inestimable!

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insects are known to be able to provide valuable nutrients to indigenous populations across the Amazon. However, studies on traditional insect use in the Peruvian Amazon are scarce. This study documents edible insect diversity and characterizes their food and collection patterns in eight Awaj˙n communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Additionally, we reviewed what has been known to date about the nutrient composition of the documented species. METHODS: The survey was conducted among the Awaj˙n populations living in the Huampami, Paisa, Achu, and Tseasim communities in the Cenepa district and the Shijap, San Mateo, Kusu, and Listra communities in the Imaza district. Data collection was conducted through a freelisting exercise complemented by a semi-structured inquiry form in the Awaj˙n language. In total, 104 informants (72 men and 32 women) aged between 16 to 73 years were interviewed. RESULTS: The Awaj˙n people use at least 12 insect species, with Rhynchophorus palmarum, Atta cephalotes, and Rhinostomus barbirostris being the most important ones. Beetles of the family Curculionidae represent the culturally most salient taxon. In the more accessible and developed Imaza district, the Awaj˙n tend to eat almost exclusively R. palmarum, while in the more isolated and preserved Cenepa district, the community\u0019s preferences are linked with more species. Although men are the main insect collectors, women cited more edible insects on average. The insects are eaten mainly roasted or raw. Further use patterns and differences between the districts are discussed. CONCLUSION: Traditional knowledge related to edible insects and the ecosystems they occur in is widespread among the Awaj˙n populations, and insects still represent an important part of the indigenous food system. This ethnobiological survey discovered five species that are newly recorded as edible insects. Chemical composition of insects deemed edible by the Awaj˙n ought to be analyzed in the future and awareness about their nutritional importance should be raised to harness the potential of this underutilized yet nutrient-rich traditional food.          *[NOTE:  This identification needs to be checked.  Crematogaster sordidula is a European-Mediterranean species.]",

They show a wide range of bizarre morphological characteristics, including highly varied trichomes, associated with this lifestyle.  They occur throughout Australia & Indomalaysia, with a few species occurring as far from this centre of diversity as India & Japan.  At present the subfamily contains 12 genera & 174 species, several of which are newly described herein (Teretriopsis theryi, gen.nov., sp.nov., Papuopsis andersoni, gen.nov., sp.nov., & Quasimodopsis riedeli, gen.nov. sp.nov.).  This paper presents a phylogenetic analysis based on morphological characters of all of the main lineages of the family, provides a complete catalogue of the species, a key to all the genera, & proposes several new combinations.  The phylogenetic analysis reveals 2 large clades, one (including the genera Chlamydopsis Westwood, Eucurtia Mjˆberg, & Ectatommiphila Lea) is largely restricted to the Australian continent, whereas the other, containing all other genera, is much more widespread, including many Australian species, but extending also through Indomalaysia into SE Asia.  The beetles are known to utilize many hosts, including ants in four different subfamilies (Myrmicinae, Ponerinae, Dolichoderinae, and Formicinae), as well as termites in the genus Eutermes.

    "abstract": "*[Most ant species are generalist feeders, & only some ground-nesting & ground-foraging species are strictly predators.  Ants are central-place foragers (with the exception of army ants during the nomadic phase) that may use different foraging strategies.  Solitary hunting is the most common method employed by predatory ants.  Cooperative hunting, considered more evolved than solitary hunting, is used by army ants & other ants such as Myrmicaria opaciventris, Paratrechina longicornis or the dominant arboreal Oecophylla.  Army ants are predators with different levels of specialization, some of which focus on a particular genus or species, as is the case for Nomamyrmex esenbeckii which organizes subterranean raids on the very large colonies of the leaf-cutting species Atta cephalotes or A. colombica.  Arboreal ants have  evolved predatory behaviors adapted to the tree foliage, where prey are unpredictable & able to escape by flying away, jumping or dropping.  The weaver ant, Oecophylla longinoda, for example, hunts prey diurnally in groups.  They detect prey visually from a relatively long distance & the workers adhere to the plant substrate by means of very powerful adhesive pads & claws.  On some occasions, during prey retrieval, the prey can be stolen by other ants; food-robbing is more frequent in ground-dwelling than in arboreal species.  Many predatory ants are engaged in a kind of arms race: they have evolved morpho-physiological adaptations to foil prey defense or escape mechanisms.  Mandible shapes have changed & powerful venoms have been developed by different species.  Depending on their prey specialization ants can have many different mandible shapes: trap-jaw mandibles, nutcracker mandibles adapted to hunting long prey, pitch-fork mandibles, falciform mandibles, & long mandibles.  Other ant species are specialized in hunting a certain prey type, but do not have a mandible shape particular to that specialization; these species are egg predators, collembolan predators, or social insect predators.  Some ant species are either specialized or occasional termite predators.]          [NOTE: S. saevissima is S. invicta or S. richteri in North America.]",

    "abstract": "We examined the morphology of the cauline domatia of the semi-myrmecophyte Humboldtia brunonis at different stages of ontogeny. We observed that the hollow chamber in H. brunonis is spontaneously formed by the plant, and suggest this to be a collective effect of both schizogeny and lysogeny, following acropetal lignification of the pith cells as the domatium internode swells up. Unlike some other cauline domatia, there is a self-opening slit that provides access to the domatium chamber. We investigated the micro-structure of the inner wall of the domatia using scanning electron microscopy, and observed that cells that form the inner lining of the domatia cavity have canaliculated, lignified sclerenchyma with numerous plasmodesmata, as reported for the true myrmecophyte Leonardoxa africana, which could explain the observed nutrient flux from domatia-dwelling invertebrates into the host plant. We also observed fungal mycelia in ant-occupied domatia, though the role of fungi in this ant-plant system awaits further investigation.",

    "abstract": "How a symbiosis originates and is maintained are important evolutionary questions. Symbioses in myrmecophytes (plants providing nesting for ants) are believed to be maintained by protection and nutrients provided by specialist plant-ants in exchange for nesting spaces (called domatia) and nourishment offered by ant-plants. However, besides the benefits accrued from housing protective ants, the mechanisms contributing to the fitness advantages of bearing domatia have rarely been examined, especially because the domatia trait is usually constitutively expressed, and many myrmecophytes have obligate mutualisms with single ant species resulting in invariant conditions. In the unspecialized ant-plant Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae) that offers extrafloral nectar to ants, only some plants produce domatia in the form of hollow internodes. These domatia have a self-opening slit making them more prone to interlopers and are occupied mostly by non-protective ants and other invertebrates, especially arboreal earthworms. The protection mutualism with ants is restricted in geographical extent, occurring only at a few sites in the southernmost part of this plant's range in the Western Ghats of India. We examined nutrient flux from domatia residents to the plant using stable isotopes. We found that between 9% (earthworms) and 17% (protective or non-protective ants) of nitrogen of plant tissues nearest the domatium came from domatia inhabitants. Therefore, interlopers such as earthworms and non-protective ants contributed positively to the nitrogen budget of localized plant modules of this understorey tree. 15N-enriched feeding experiments with protective ants demonstrated that nutrients flowed from domatia inhabitants to nearby plant modules. Fruit set did not differ between paired hand-pollinated inflorescences on domatia and non-domatia bearing branches. This was possibly due to the nutrient flux from domatia to adjacent branches without domatia within localized modules. This study has demonstrated the nutritive role of non-protective ants and non-ant invertebrates, hitherto referred to as interlopers, in an unspecialized myrmecophyte. Our study suggests that even before the establishment of a specialized ant-plant protection mutualism, nutritional benefits conferred by domatia inhabitants can explain the fitness benefits of bearing domatia, and thus the maintenance of a trait that facilitates the establishment of a specialized ant-plant symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting summer monsoon rainfall with precision becomes crucial for the farmers to plan for harvesting in a country like India where the national economy is mostly based on regional agriculture. The forecast of monsoon rainfall based on artificial neural network is a well-researched problem. In the present study, the meta-heuristic ant colony optimization (ACO) technique is implemented to forecast the amount of summer monsoon rainfall for the next day over Kolkata (22.6-degrees N, 88.4-degrees E), India. The ACO technique belongs to swarm intelligence and simulates the decision-making processes of ant colony similar to other adaptive learning techniques. ACO technique takes inspiration from the foraging behavior of some ant species. The ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark a favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. A range of rainfall amount replicating the pheromone concentration is evaluated during the summer monsoon season. The maximum amount of rainfall during summer monsoon season (June-September) is observed to be within the range of 7.5-35 mm during the period from 1998 to 2007, which is in the range 4 category set by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The result reveals that the accuracy in forecasting the amount of rainfall for the next day during the summer monsoon season using ACO technique is 95% where as the forecast accuracy is 83% with Markov chain model (MCM). The forecast through ACO and MCM are compared with other existing models and validated with IMD observations from 2008 to 2012.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the influence of habitat on floral (flower and nectar characteristics, phenology) and pollination biology (flower visitors and breeding system) on Callistemon citrinus (syn. Callistemon lanceolatus), an Australian species of family Myrtaceae. In India, this small ornamental tree is cultivated in gardens, avenues and road sides and flowers throughout the year. At Agra (Uttar Pradesh, northern India) this species flowers twice a year (February-May and August-November). Flowers open early in the morning and can be characterized as protandrous for a brief period. Fresh open flowers presented ca. 25% of total produced nectar. Nectar sugar composition consisted of only glucose and fructose. A wide array of visitors (honey bees (Apis dorsata), butterflies, wasps, ants, moth, hover flies, several birds and Indian palm squirrel) visit flowers either for pollen or nectar or for facilitating self- and cross-pollination by their intra- and inter-tree movements. Among these, honey bees are dominant in number and in the amount of pollen on their body, while butterflies, ants, wasps, sunbirds, parrots, oriental white-eye sparrow and squirrels forage only for nectar and can be considered occasional pollinators or nectar thieves. Although flowers are highly visited, nectar in standing crop showed that flower visitors did not consume the total nectar produced. Nectar replenishment decreased with age in both bagged- and exposed flowers, showing the capability of secreting nectar after removal during the entire flower lifetime. Experimental hand-pollinations showed that naturalized C. citrinus fruits matured through autogamy, geitonogamy or xenogamy as was reported for native Australian populations. C. citrinus displays an interesting reproductive strategy, shows phenotypic plasticity of flowering periodicity and interacts with a generalized pollinator system, attracts a wide array of animal species with a conspicuous amount or replenished nectar after removals, and uses both compatibility strategies - xenogamy and autogamy - to ensure successful pollination and seed production at native or naturalized habitats.",

    "abstract": "Ants of the genus Formica play an important role in biogenesis by participating in various processes, including the formation of complex trophic networks. The role of ants in an ecosystem depends on their species and geographic population, which can be difficult to identify. Formica gagatoides with a wide range and F. kozlovi are among some examples. The question is whether the Siberian populations of F. kozlovi really belong to this species or are local populations of F. gagatoides. Based on the materials collected in Russia (Murmansk Region, the north of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, Altai, Far East), a morphological analysis (key diagnostic features) and molecular genetic analysis (COI, ITS1, D2 28S) were carried out. In all localities, there were individuals with pure (gagatoides, kozlovi) and mixed (gagatoides/kozlovi) morphotypes, with the exception of the Magadan Region, where the kozlovi morphotype was absent.

Ant abundance and diversity were monitored at the level of genus at two field sites in West Lafayette, IN, taking into account temperature, humidity, and habitat as possible factors in ant distribution. Temperature was found to be a significant factor affecting the abundance of ants, while humidity was not. The different habitats at the two locations resulted in the presence of different genera. The number of pavement ants was positively correlated with the number of cornfield ants (Lasius neoniger Emery) in Copper Beech Apartments, but not at Purdue Village. There was also a slightly greater diversity of ants found at Copper Beech Apartments.",

The study was carried out at 2 sampling stations: Elliot park & Agri-Horticulture Society.  The flower species were selected: Helianthus annuus, Petunia sp., & Bouganvilia spectabilis, because these species are more common among other species.  In each flower, diversity of visiting insects were studied by qualitative & quantitative assessment.  Indices were Species richness, Index of Dominance, Relative abundance, Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, & Evenness Index for insects for all selected sites were calculated using the statistical formulae. The present results clearly indicate that the flower visiting insects are very less in numbers on 3 flowering species & index values were decreased.  It was concluded that the 3 flowering species (sunflower, petunia, bougainvillea) are very common in both the parks, but insect visitors are common, but present less in number, which may be due to the vehicular pollution and/or human interference and/or landscape changes due to nearby neighborhood blocks, office, & residential buildings, etc.]",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is well known as one of the major risk for cardiovascular diseases which annually affect millions of people. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a key role in blood pressure regulation process. Indeed, hypertension treatment by synthetic ACE inhibitors (e.g. captopril, lisinopril and ramipril) is effective; however, their use can cause serious side effects, such as hypotension, cough, reduced renal function and angioedema. Thus, research was focused on natural ACE inhibitory peptides sources such as foodstuffs and also, more recently, edible insects. In the last decades, ACE inhibitory activity has been detected in protein hydrolysates from insect species belonging to the orders of Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and also Orthoptera. Further investigations led to identify specific ACE inhibitory peptides from the silkworm Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), the yellow mealworm Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and also from the weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Even if ACE inhibitory activity of these bioactive peptides has been in vitro assayed and is comparable to those of some bioactive peptides derived from other animal protein sources, the in vivo effectiveness of most of these bioactive peptides still needs to be confirmed. The aim of this review is to present an outline of the currently available data on the potential use of insects for hypertension treatment with a focus on the ACE inhibitory peptides identified in these invertebrates to date.",

It is not very likely that the species that have received the most attention are in any way representative of ants in general.  Pogonomyrmex ants, which have the best demographic information, form large colonies with very long-lived queens.  They produce colonies that are genetically diverse, due to multiply mated queens, & the colonies gather seeds as a main food source.  This deviates in every way from more 'typical' ants.  Leaf-cutter ants, which also have substantial demographic data, have the same list of oddities only perhaps more extreme; they also have multiply mated queens, huge colonies, & have the most intricate caste system specialized for processing vegetation & cultivating fungi.  The demography of fire ants is known primarily from its introduced range.  The list of species that are well-known are those that have advantages for collecting demographic data.  It is important to remember that we are not in a position to make generalizations about ant demography.

The spatial & temporal biological diversity of ants belonging to subfamily Formicinae compared to total diversity of ants collected was studied at 4 diverse sampling sites: an agricultural field where a Kharif crop (soybean) was grown followed by a  rabi crop (mustard); a relatively undisturbed forested area with tall subabul trees; a grassy lawn, & a mango orchard from July 2005 to June 2006 at fortnightly intervals.  Although species richness fluctuated between 2 & 3 at each sampling site throughout the sampling period, a total of only 5 different species could be collected from the various sites, viz., C. compressus, C. parius, C. sericeus, L. frauenfeldi, & C. setipes.  C. compressus was found at all microhabitats as a dominant species.

    "abstract": "In queenless species of ants, colonies consist of workers with equivalent reproductive potentials. Aggressive interactions regulate fertility and sexual activity. The genus Diacamma is unusual, because monogyny is regulated by mutilation (i.e., removal of a pair of tiny innervated thoracic appendages) of all young workers. One exception is the 'nilgiri' population from south India, where only 6 % of workers were mutilated in ten field colonies (range 2.8-12.5 %). Nonetheless, all colonies were monogynous. To investigate the behavioural mechanisms underlying the replacement of the 'gamergate' (mated reproductive worker) in 'nilgiri', we experimentally divided colonies in two. In the groups lacking the gamergate, aggression soon started among the younger workers. One of these workers exhibited a dominant posture after 1-2 days, and this new alpha started ovipositing and sexual calling within 2-3 weeks. When she was confronted with the original gamergate, olfactory recognition occurred immediately, and this sometimes led to a characteristic dominance behaviour ('sting smearing'). The fate of 85 young workers of known age was studied: they were usually the target of aggression from either gamergates or new alphas. Their gemmae elicited attention, although these were seldom removed. A small change in the gemma pheromone apparently caused an evolutionary switch from mutilation (as occurs in the very closely related D. ceylonense) to a reversible regulation of reproduction in 'nilgiri'.",

A low buzzing note was coming from the nests, and McGovern realized that they had arrived just in time for the swarming of these insects.  He was perplexed as to how the Indians had gauged their arrival so accurately, for almost at once thousands of the queens and drones began to take wing. The natives turned the baskets upside down over the various exits, and the ants flew into them and were caught.  All of the baskets were quickly filled, and the ant hunting expedition returned to camp jubilant.          .......The ants were not very large, but some ninety to a hundred of them made a very satisfactory meal, according to McGovern.  The Indians ate some of them raw, and others they roasted.  Of the raw ants they ate only the heads.  However, the whole bodies were eaten if they were roasted.  The Indians had large earthenware pans in which they roasted the insects over the fire.  McGovern, a true scientific spirit ever eager for new experiences, tried the ants both cooked and raw.  He found the uncooked heads too oily, but the roasted ants tasted to him like crisp bacon; and he could not understand why anyone should object to eating them.  These Indians considered ants a great delicacy.\".          \"Humboldt (1850; vide Cutright 1943: 311) reported that, on the Rio Negro, the Indians ate a white paste containing black spots which proved to be dried, smoked ants.  \"Several bags of them were hanging above a fire at the time to be used in subsequent repasts\".]",

    "abstract": "In the queenless ant, Diacamma ceylonense, the cuticular hydrocarbons (C25-C35) of nestmate workers vary in their proportions according to age and fertility. Newly eclosed adults ('callows') initially have the same cuticular profile, but with time this changes to that typical of foragers. In contrast, workers that begin to produce eggs develop a different cuticular profile. Several substances (n-C29 and some methyl C25 and C27) discriminate these different social categories (callows, foragers and egg-layers). In Diacamma ceylonense, inter-colony variation of the cuticular hydrocarbons was much lower than intra-colony variation. We also found qualitative differences between the sexes, with males having a clearly different profile with much more alkanes. We discuss these results in the context of physiological models of the relation between ovarian activity and the synthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons. Variations in cuticular profile are a reliable reflection of ovarian activity, and could be used by ants as a fertility signal.          *[Thirteen colonies of Diacamma ceylonense (282+-93 workers per colony) were collected from Bangalore (S India) in November 1998, August 1999, December 1999, & April 2000.]",

    "abstract": "Economic losses resulting from vineyard mealybug infestations have increased dramatically during the past decade. In response, there has been a cosmopolitan effort to improve control strategies and better understand mealybug biology and ecology, as well as their role as vectors of plant pathogens. Mealybugs are named for the powdery secretions covering their bodies. The most important vineyard mealybugs belong to the subfamily Pseudococcinae (Hardy et al. 2008). Although numerous mealybug species are found in vineyards, this chapter will cover only those that have risen to the level of primary pest. These are the grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus (Ehrhorn), obscure mealybug, Pseudococcus viburni (Signoret), long-tailed mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni Tozzetti), citrophilus mealybug, Pseudococcus calceolariae (Maskell), vine mealybug, Planococcus ficus (Signoret), citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso), pink hibiscus mealybug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green), and the newly identified Gills mealybug, Ferrisia gilli Gullan. Meanwhile in Brazil and India, Dysmicoccus brevipes (Cockerell) and Xenococcus annandalei Silvestri respectively, feed on vine roots. Collectively, these species will be referred to as the vineyard mealybugs, although their host range is diverse and many are pests of other agricultural crops and ornamental plants (McKenzie 1967; Ben-Dov 1995).   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)",

    "abstract": "The widespread and rapid establishment of the olive fruit fly in California required immediate changes in integrated pest management (IPM) programs for olives. After finding that resident natural enemies did not provide adequate control, researchers began a worldwide search for parasitoids, with exploration in the Republic of South Africa, Namibia, India, China and other countries. Parasitoids were shipped to California, and most were studied in quarantine to determine the best species for release. Two parasitoid species - Psyttalia lounsburyi and Psyttalia humilis - are now being released throughout the state\u0019s olive-growing regions, and researchers are studying their effectiveness.   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)          *[Ants (e. g., Formica species) were the most abundant predators on the ground & were observed carrying & killing olive fruit fly pupae.  Predation rates vary among orchards, depending on factors such as the species & densities of predators present & the soil depth at which fly pupae are located.]",

    "abstract": "Information available on species composition, richness and diversity of ant communities of Western Ghats is limited. Recognizing this, the study (2010-2013) was undertaken to evaluate richness and diversity of ants in eight sites of Western Ghats, India, with added notes on how it varies on elevation gradient. Spanning across broad altitudinal and latitudinal gradient, selected sites differed greatly for various micro-habitat variables. Using standard collection protocols and employing five collection techniques, 173 species belonging to 65 genera in 10 subfamilies were collected including twenty species published as new to science and two genera and six species reported for the first time from India. Varying among sites, species richness was recorded lowest (S =/29) at Manalar and highest (S/=/116) at Periyar Tiger Reserve. With little but significant variations among sites, the Shannon-Wiener's species diversity index (H2) was recorded highest (H2/=/2.60) at Periyar Tiger Reserve and lowest (H2/=/2.11) at Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary connoting that sites with lower richness were not necessarily less diverse. Beta diversity (≤-diversity) was lowest (19%) between contiguous sites like Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary and Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary and highest between site Manalar and Periyar Tiger Reserve at 68% suggesting that ant species composition distinctly varied in these sites. Our results indicated that only few species were adapted to full spectrum of environmental variation along altitudinal gradient studied and both species richness and diversity peaked at mid-elevations as against higher elevations wherein it underwent rapid decline. Such behavior is presumably due to favorable ecological conditions at middle altitudes. Our findings rank high as they not only provide baseline data against which futuristic faunal changes could be assessed with respect to perturbations in a biodiversity hotspot but they also could be used to designate ecological sensitivities to various regions of Western Ghats for future conservation programs.",

Normally only a small proportion of bushes is affected & these are associated with the presence of nests of an undetermined species of Pheidole.An account is given of the life-history of O. assectator, & the developmental stages are briefly described.  The eggs are laid singly in incisions made by the ovipositor on the underside of the leaf in parallel rows arranged lengthwise.  The newly hatched larvae exist as free-living planidia on the leaf surface, from where, they are carried by unknown means into the ants' nests in the soil beneath the tea bushes.  Here the planidium transfers to the last-instar larva of the ant & penetrates its body.  There it remains inactive, until its host reaches the prepupal stage, then endoparasitic feeding & development start.  After the host pupa has formed, the parasite larva emerges, establishes itself below the thorax of its host.  It remains there, feeding ectoparasitically, through 2 further instars, completely consuming the contents of its host.

The results indicate the anticipated presence of neurotoxin in ant venom (2,5-dipropyl-decahydroquinoline). This alkaloid is a known non-competitive inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), but the proper mechanism of inhibition by decahydroquinoline was obscure and has been addressed in this study. Based on the results and known facts, the second part of this study deals with in silico docking and molecular dynamics simulations to portray the molecular level inhibition of nAChRs by decahydroquinolines. Molecular docking and dynamics studies indicate that the inhibition of nAChRs by decahydroquinoline is attained by occluding the pore lumen of nAChRs in the serine-leucine ring. The GC-MS analysis followed by in silico studies thereby indicates that the potent non-competitive inhibitor of nAChRs found in the venom of Oecophylla must be posing paralyzing effects on its prey.",

Ants generally forage for flowers in quest of nectar & other sustenance, & in doing so they pollinate the flowers that they encounter.  This review identified the pollination networks between ants & plants at the species & family levels.  Pollination is often affected by a number of aspects, including the flower's sex, its ovary position, the inflorescence it bears, & the time of year.  The available literature demonstrates that ants visit the inflorescences of the same species only to promote cross-pollination, a process known as 'geitonogamy'; however, we conclude that ants may visit different inflorescences of different plants in the field.  If ant pollination is the norm, there is less selection pressure to acquire self-compatibility; nonetheless, ants' cross-pollination may have caused ants to co-evolve with the pollinating flowers.  This indicates that ants are more than just curious bystanders to some flowers; they act as significant pollinators.]          *[Myrmecia urens incorrectly listed with Myrmicinae; Myrmeciinae not included in counts of subfamilies.]",

We investigated whether impacts caused by the introduced yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes), a pantropical invader rapidly expanding its range, extend to higher-order consumers by comparing counts, behaviors, and nesting success of endemic forest birds in ant-invaded and uninvaded rainforest on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). Point counts and direct behavioral observations showed that ant invasion altered abundances and behaviors of the bird species we examined: the Island Thrush (Turdus poliocephalus erythropleurus), Emerald Dove (Chalcophaps indica natalis), and Christmas Island White-eye (Zosterops natalis). The thrush, which frequents the forest floor, altered its foraging and reproductive behaviors in ant-invaded forest, where nest-site location changed, and nest success and juvenile counts were lower. Counts of the dove, which forages exclusively on the forest floor, were 9-14 times lower in ant-invaded forest. In contrast, counts and foraging success of the white-eye, a generalist feeder in the understory and canopy, were higher in ant-invaded forest, where mutualism between the ant and honeydew-secreting scale insects increased the abundance of scale-insect prey. These complex outcomes involved the interplay of direct interference by ants and altered resource availability and habitat structure caused indirectly by ant invasion. Ecological meltdown, rapidly unleashed by ant invasion, extended to these endemic forest birds and may affect key ecosystem processes, including seed dispersal.",

A. gracilipes directly interfered with frugivory; their experimental exclusion from fruiting displays increased fruit handling 3-fold to 6-fold, compounding indirect effects of ant invasion on resources & habitat structure that influence bird abundances & behaviors.  This invasive ant, whose high densities are sustained through mutualism with introduced scale insects, rapidly decreases fruit handling by endemic island birds & may erode a key ecological function, seed dispersal.  Because most other invasive ant species form expansive, high-density supercolonies that depend in part on association with hemipteran mutualists, the effects that we report here on avian frugivore-plant associations may emerge across their introduced ranges.]",

Preventing high\u0010risk INNS from being introduced is the most cost\u0010effective way to avoid their adverse impacts. We applied a horizon scanning approach to identify potentially INNS in the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (OTs), ranging from Antarctica to the Caribbean, and from the Pacific to the Atlantic. High\u0010risk species were identified according to their potential for arrival, establishment, and likely impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function, economies, and human health. Across OTs, 231 taxa were included on high\u0010risk lists. The highest ranking species were the Asian green mussel (Perna viridis), little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), and mesquite tree (Prosopis juliflora). Shipping containers were identified as the introduction pathway associated with the most species. The shared high\u0010risk species and pathways identified provide a guide for other remote islands and archipelagos to focus ongoing biosecurity and surveillance aimed at preventing future incursions.",

    "abstract": "The correct identification of colony boundaries is an essential prerequisite for empirical studies of ant behavior and evolution. Ant colonies function at various organizational levels, and these boundaries may be difficult to assess. Moreover, new complexity can be generated through the presence of spatially discrete subgroups within a more or less genetically homogeneous colony, a situation called polydomy. A colony is polydomous only if individuals (workers and brood) of its constituent nests function as a social and cooperative unit and are regularly interchanged among nests. This condition was previously called polycalic, and the term polydomy was used in a broader sense for a group of daughter nests of the same mother colony (implying limited female dispersal), without regard to whether these different nests continued to exchange individuals. We think that this distinction between 'polycaly' and 'polydomy' concerns two disparate concepts. We thus prefer the narrower definition of polydomy, which groups individuals that interact socially. Does this new level of organization affect the way in which natural selection acts on social traits? Here, after examining the history of terms, we review all ant species that have been described as expressing polydomous structures. We show that there is no particular syndrome of traits predictably associated with polydomy. We detail the existing theoretical predictions and empirical results on the ecology of polydomy, and the impact of polydomy on social evolution and investment strategies, while carefully distinguishing monogynous from polygynous species. Finally, we propose a methodology for future studies and offer ideas about what remains to be done.",

    "abstract": "Twenty\u0010three Aphaenogaster species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) occur in North America. While morphology and ecology define most species, the species limits of a group in the Eastern United States are unclear. In particular, the morphological and behavioural characters of A. carolinensis, A. picea and A. rudis overlap. These observations suggest that these three species are not monophyletic. We therefore tested the monophyly of Aphaenogaster in the context of molecular phylogenetic analyses. We used DNA data from five genes: CO1, CAD, EF1±F2, long\u0010wavelength rhodopsin and wingless, to reconstruct phylogenies for 44 Aphaenogaster and outgroup species. In the resulting trees, reconstructed using parsimony and Bayesian inference, species boundaries associated with well\u0010supported monophyletic clades of individuals in most of the 23 North American Aphaenogaster collected from multiple locations. However, some clades were unresolved, and both A. picea and A. rudis were not monophyletic. Although this may indicate that clades of multiple species represent fewer but morphologically varied species, given the short branch lengths, the lack of resolution may reflect the fact that these ants have recently radiated, and a lack of gene lineage sorting explains the non\u0010monophyly of species. Additional biological information concerning pre\u0010 and postmating barriers is needed before a complete revision of species boundaries for Aphaenogaster.

The possible correlation between the cavedwelling life & this partial neoteny is briefly discussed, but with a remarkable fact: in the evolution of Eustra, the neotenic features appeared before the colonization of caves.  An identification key of the species is given.  Totally, 13 new taxa are described: Eustra hammondi n.sp., E. gomyi n.sp., E. matanga darlingtoni n.ssp., E. matanga negrosensis n.ssp., E. csikii burmanensis n.ssp., E. taiwanica n.sp., E. pseudomatanga n.sp., E. pseudomatanga cavernicola n.ssp., E. plagiata peguensis n.ssp., E. ceylanica n.sp., E. indica n.sp., E. storki n.sp., & E. andrewesiana n.sp.  The genus Ozaenaphaenops Deuve, 1986, proposed for the troglobiomorphic species, is here considered as a junior subjective synonym of Eustra Schmidt-Goebel, 1846.

An ethogram of oviposition behavior was constructed based on observations made in an oviposition cage. Ovipositional behavioral acts were catalogued and separated into two behavioral repertoires: searching and egg laying. Gravid females of S. epius oviposited similar numbers of eggs on three mealybug species. Females preferred eggs and adults to nymphs of mealybugs for oviposition. Among three species of mealybugs attended by ants, females laid fewer eggs in the mealybug mass attended by Oecophylla smaragdina than on mealybugs attended by Tapinoma melanocephalum and Camponotus variegatus. Females preferred mealybug masses already containing conspecific eggs to mealybug masses containing conspecific larvae or Cryptolaemus montrouzieri larvae for egg deposition. Gravid females laid larger numbers of eggs under bright sunlight than in diffused sunlight or shade. The results of this study showed that S. epius can effectively attack any species of mealybugs, avoid intra- and interspecific competition, and co-exist with some species of ants attending mealybugs. With the knowledge of these behaviors, this predator can be effectively utilized as a major biological control agent of mealybugs.",

    "abstract": "Spalgis epius is an economically important hemipterophagous butterfly. Detailed information on the population dynamics, natural enemies, and prey range of S. epius and its association with mealybug-attendant ant species is lacking. Three years of field studies conducted at Bangalore University campus, Bengaluru, India on these aspects indicated that the population density of S. epius was greatest from June to December and least from February to May in the low land region. S. epius survived on eight prey species, which were present in different months, of which Phenacoccus indicus was recorded as a prey of S. epius for the first time. Different prey species occurred on 12 species of host plants. The occurrence of S. epius was negatively correlated with temperature and positively correlated with relative humidity and prey populations. Six mealybug-attendant ant species were associated with the larvae of S. epius . The seven general predators of S. epius adults were recorded. Knowledge on the population dynamics and a prey range of S. epius and its interaction with mealybug-attendant ant species could be helpful to using this predator as a major biocontrol agent of various species of mealybugs. This study contributed to our understanding of the population dynamics of a hemipterophagous butterfly.",

    "abstract": "*[My research focused on the evolution of reproductive strategies in social insects, more precisely in ants both at the colony & individual level.  The species studied are characterized by a mode of colony foundation by fission, i.e. new colonies are founded with the help of workers.  Colony fission has rarely been studied in monogynous species.  A population genetic approach has showed that limited dispersal associated to fission lead to significant genetic differentiation at the scale of few hundred meters.  This differentiation strongly increasing with geographical distance.   Another consequence of fission is the succession of reproductive females over time within colonies, which affect the relatedness between colony members.  Moreover, each change of reproductive females is generally associated with conflicts that we showed to be costly for workers both by decreasing the time spent at working & by decreasing their immune defences.  These costs can affect the optimal rate of reproductive changes as well as the rate of fission.  At the individual scale, I was especially interested in the evolution of mating system, especially of polyandry & parthenogenesis in the ant Cataglyphis cursor.  Our work revealed a peculiar reproductive strategy of the ant queens, i.e. a conditional use of sexual reproduction with high level of polyandry for the production of workers & of parthenogenesis for the production of new queens.  Such reproductive strategy increases the rate of gene transmission by the queen, keeping at the same time the advantages of a genetically diverse workers force.  In my research project, I plan to investigate in more details the evolution of such reproductive strategy as well as the optimal strategies of fission.  I also would like to develop an evolutionary immunology approach for a better understanding of the evolution of mating strategy and of some aspects of division of labor.]           Includes complete copies of: ANNEXE 1: Doums C, Cabrera, H, Peeters C, 2002, Population genetic structure and male-biased dispersal in the queenless ant Diacamma cyaneiventre, Molecular Ecology 50: 2251-2264, appendix 1.

We used both mitochondrial & microsatellite markers to assess the consequence of such restricted female dispersal at 3 geographical scales: within a given locality of less-than 1 km, between localities within a given region of less-than 10 km, & between regions more-than of 36 km.  Within a locality, a strong population structure was observed for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) whereas weak or nonexistent population genetic structure was observed for the microsatellites, around 5% of the value for mtDNA.  Male gene flow was estimated to be about 20-30 times higher than female gene flow at this scale.   At a larger spatial scale, very strong genetic differentiation for both markers was observed between localities, even within a single region.  Female dispersal is nonexistent at these scales & male dispersal is very restricted, especially between regions.  The phylogeographical structure of the mtDNA haplotypes as well as the very low genetic diversity of mtDNA within localities indicate that new sites are colonized by a single migration event from adjacent localities, followed by successive colony fissions.  These patterns of genetic variability & differentiation agree with what is theoretically expected when colonization events are kin-structured & when, following colonization, dispersion is mainly performed by males.]",

    "abstract": "Olfaction plays a dominant role in insect communication. Alarm pheromones, which alert other insects of the same species of impending danger, are a major class of releaser pheromones. The major components of alarm pheromones in red imported fire ants, honeybees and aphids have been identified as 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethylpyrazine (2E-3,6-DP), isopentyl acetate (IPA), and E-&beta;-farnesene (E&beta;F), respectively. In this study, electroantennography (EAG) responses to EDP (a mixture of 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethylpyrazine and 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine), IPA and E&beta;F were investigated in a wide range of insect species. Beside imported fire ants, the EDP (2-ethyl-3,6(5)-dimethylpyrazine) elicited significant EAG response from all other tested insects, including six ant species and one hybrid ant, honeybee, bagrada bug, lady beetle, housefly, small hive beetle, yellow fever mosquito, termite, bedbug, water hyacinth weevil, southern green stink bug and two aphid species. In contrast, IPA elicited significant EAG response only in the honeybee, red imported fire ant, an Aphaenogaster ant, and the water hyacinth weevil. The E&beta;F only elicited EAG responses in two aphids, small hive beetle and housefly. The results clearly indicate that EDP can be detected by widespread insect species that did not coevolve with S. invicta and further suggested alkylpyrazine may activate multiple generally tuned olfactory receptors (ORs) across a wide number of insect species.

The most common ant was Camponotus atriceps, found in both orchid species & in both habitats.  We found no significant difference in number of ant species & proportion of ant occupancy of orchid clusters from along the North Coast Road (6 species in 12 of 12 clusters) versus around urban St. Augustine (8 species in 9 of 12 clusters).

Camponotus compressus ants regularly visit the extrafloral nectary-bearing, lycaenid-infested cowpea, Vigna unguiculata plants and construct a shelter for the lycaenid caterpillars at the plant base. The present study shows that ants may influence the overall fitness of the infested cowpea plants by providing nutrients via soil and foliar pathways. Total carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content of ant constructed shelter (ACS) soil of the lycaenid-harbouring plants were assessed, microbes from the ACS soil were isolated and their plant growth promotion ability was evaluated. Nitrate content of the ant faecal matter was estimated and overall plant fitness was assessed in terms of its growth and yield. The results revealed higher content of total C, N and P in the debris and chamber soil of ACS as compared to the control soil from the base of ant-excluded plants. The microbes isolated from the ACS and ant nest soil were found to possess plant growth promotion abilities. Ant faecal matter was found to contain substantial amount of nitrate. The ant-included, lycaenid-infested plants as well as those lacking the caterpillars demonstrated significantly higher number of pods, number of seeds per pod, root length, shoot length, plant height, number of leaves, plant fresh and dry weight as compared to the control plants. Lycaenid caterpillar tending ant species with a high propensity for visiting plants thus have the potential to increase plant fitness by increasing nutrient availability via multiple pathways.",

Future investigations of the dynamics of genetic diversity in this crop in traditional agroecosystems must consider the role of the 'wild' sexual reproduction that occurs in parallel with vegetative propagation.

    "abstract": "One characteristic of true bugs (Heteroptera) is the presence of dorsal abdominal glands in the immature nymphal stages. These glands usually produce defensive chemicals (allomones) that vary among taxa but are still similar in closely related groups. Knowledge of the chemistry and prevalence of allomones in different taxa may clarify the evolution of these chemical defensive strategies. Within the infraorder Pentatomomorpha, the known secretions of nymphs of Pentatomidae tend to contain the hydrocarbon, n-tridecane, a keto-aldehyde, and an (E)-2-alkenal as the most abundant components. In the Coreidae, the dorsal abdominal gland secretions of nymphs often contain little or no hydrocarbon, and the most abundant keto-aldehyde and (E)-2-alkenal are often of shorter chain-length than those of pentatomids. We hypothesized that the long chain compounds would be less potent than their shorter homologs, and that bugs that carry the former would benefit from a synergistic effect of n-tridecane. To test this hypothesis we used three different behavioral assays with ants. A predator-prey assay tested the deterrence of allomones toward predators; a vapor experiment tested the effectiveness of allomones in the gaseous phase toward predators; and application of allomones onto predators tested the effect of direct contact. The results substantiate the hypothesis of a synergistic effect between n-tridecane and longer chain keto-aldehyde and (E)-2-alkenal in deterring predators. The short chain keto-aldehyde 4-oxo-(E)-2-hexenal was highly effective on its own. Thus, it seems that different groups of the infraorder diverged in their strategies involving defensive chemicals. Implications of this divergence are discussed.          *[Colonies of H. saltator initially were excavated at Jog Falls, Karnataka, S India in the years 1994, 1995, & 1999, & are currently kept in a USDA-approved containment room at Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.

    "abstract": "This study describes the worker and queen castes of the Neotropical ponerine Corrieopone nouragues gen. nov., sp. nov., an ant from the tropical rainforest in French Guiana. Worker morphology of the taxon is compared with those of other Ponerinae and the similarities between them are discussed, refining the definition of character states for some diagnostic characters at the generic level, providing an identification key to the Neotropical genera, and making some adjustments to the taxonomic framework within the subfamily. Descriptions, diagnosis, character discussion, identi\u0001cation key, and glossary are illustrated with more than 300 images and line drawings. Open science is supported by providing access to measurement data for specimens of the new genus, a matrix of character states for all ponerine taxa evaluated in this study, and specimen data for all examined material. The new or revived combinations presented here are Pachycondyla procidua Emery, comb. rev., Neoponera curiosa (Mackay and Mackay), comb. nov., Leptogenys butteli (Forel), comb. nov., and Bothroponera escherichi (Forel), comb. nov. In addition, Leptogenys butteli is synonymized with Leptogenys myops (Emery), syn. nov.",

    "abstract": "*[We present a more detailed molecular phylogenetic analysis, including a larger number of species of Anochetus & Odontomachus, & from diverse biogeographical regions, in order to prove the relationships between the 2 genera & between Brown's species groups.  We obtained DNA sequence data from one mitochondrial (COI) & 4 nuclear protein-coding genes (Wg, TOPI, LW Rh e CAD) for a total of 207 ingroup & 14 outgroup specimens.  Twelve fossil species were used to calibrate divergence-time & biogeographic analyses.  Bayesian & maximum-likelihood (RAxML & GARLI) analyses strongly support the monophyly of the genera Anochetus & Odontomachus.  They also strongly support 9 Odontomachus & 12 Anochetus species groups that are mostly concordant with Brown's hypotheses.  The analyses indicate that Odontoponera is the sister group of the Anochetus + Odontomachus clade, suggesting that trap-jaw ants evolved from a short-mandibled ancestor.  Anochetus + Odontomachus originated in the early Paleocene (64.8 Ma), likely in the Neotropical, Afrotropical, or Indomalayan regions, where they have radiated rapidly in the last 50 million years, & subsequently dispersing multiple times to Africa, Asia, & Australia.  The Neotropical region currently has 26 species, distributed from N Mexico to N Argentina & some Caribbean islands.  Based on morphological similarities, Brown divided the neotropical Anochetus species into 5 species groups: A. emarginatus, A. bispinosus, A. inermis, A. mayri, & A. altisquamis.  Since then, 5 new species have been described (4 in the emarginatus group & one in the bispinosus group), but without explicit taxonomic treatments of shared characters.  We present the first Neotropical review for the genus, after almost 40 years, also taking into account the groups of species recognized for the neotropics.  From the 26 Anochetus species previously known, 22 were redescribed based on the examination of type-material.  Based on the type-material study, a new synonymy, & 3 new species were recognized for the Neotropical region.  The species now have identification keys for workers, queens, & males & updated distributions.  For the Neotropical region, Anochetus has now 28 species & 6 species groups: A. altisquamis, A. bispinosus, A. emarginatus, A. hohenbergiae, A. inermis, & A. mayri.]",

    "abstract": "We present a phylogeny of the trap\u0010jaw ant genera Anochetus and Odontomachus with dense taxon sampling representing all biogeographical regions and all species groups for both genera. Four nuclear protein\u0010coding genes (Long\u0010wavelength rhodopsin, Topoisomerase I, Wingless and Rudimentary) and one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome oxidase I) were sequenced for 221 individuals of Anochetus (44 species) and Odontomachus (38 species). Analyses using Bayesian and maximum\u0010likelihood criteria recovered essentially the same phylogenetic relationships, including strongly supported reciprocal monophyly of both genera. The analyses recovered nine of the 12 species groups previously proposed for Odontomachus and nine of the 22 species groups previously proposed for Anochetus. Based on these results, species groups are redefined. Anochetus contained an additional new, previously unrecognized group defined here as the hohenbergiae group. Divergence\u0010time analyses estimated the clade composed of Odontomachus\t+\tAnochetus arose during the early Paleocene, with Odontomachus and Anochetus diverging during the Eocene. Biogeographic analyses suggest that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Odontomachus and Anochetus occupied either the Neotropical or Afrotropical region during the late Cretaceous and that the two genera radiated during the early Paleocene. The ancestor of Odontomachus originated in the Neotropical or Afrotropical regions, giving rise to lineages that radiated during the late Eocene, and the ancestor of Anochetus originated in the Neotropical region, giving rise to lineages that radiated during the early Eocene.          *Non Anochetus or Odontomachus species used as outgroups.].

    "abstract": "*[The Paraponerinae has experienced a series of changes in its taxonomic history.  Indeed, morphological & molecular data in more recent phylogenies indicate that the position of Paraponerinae within the poneromorph group is still undefined, since certain phylogenetic relationships with Proceratiinae, Agroecomyrmecinae, & Amblyoponinae have not been clarified.  Paraponerinae has two species, Paraponera clavata, the only living species, and Paraponera dieteri, a fossil species from Dominican amber.  The genus diagnosis is the presence of antennal scrobes in a 'v' shape curving behind the eyes, antennal sockets hidden by the frontal lobes & located far from the anterior margin of the head, tarsal claws with pre-apical teeth, & a long sub-rectangular petiolar node.  Ants are large, with workers reaching more than 2.5 cm.  The colony size can vary between 200-3000 workers & the nest is usually located at the base of trees.  The workers establish stable foraging trails, actively foraging in both, understorey & canopy.   P. clavata has an omnivorous diet, with workers frequently observed foraging on extrafloral nectaries and carrying small invertebrates to the nest.  Foraging studies indicate that P. clavata is primarily nocturnal, but the foraging time can vary among the colonies.  P. clavata is widely distributed, with records from Nicaragua in Central America, through to the center & south of Brazil.  Largescale distribution maps in South America suggest that the occurrence of P. clavata is more correlated with abiotic variables, such as rainfall and mean temperature, than with biotic variables, such as type of vegetation.  Paraponera clavata has an extremely painful sting, with symptoms of fever, chills, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, & cardiac arrhythmia.  The pain after a sting is the main symptom, being extremely violent & able to remain for up to 24 hours.  P. clavata venom is neurotoxic, acting directly on the central nervous system of insects to block transmission at synapses, & has potential use for application in biological insecticides.  Individuals of P. clavata, locally known as \u0018tucandiras or tucandeiras\u0019 are used as folklore elements.  In the northern region of Brazil, the SaterÈ-MawÈ Indians use tucandeiras in rites of passage to adulthood.]",

Camponotus, Crematogaster, Myrmica, & Oecophylla are the most frequently parasitized ant genera.  The distribution of ant-parasitic representatives of the Lycaenidae suggests that only Camponotus & Crematogaster have multiply been invaded as hosts by different independent butterfly lineages.  A general linear model reveals that the number of associated nonparasitic lycaenid butterfly species is the single best predictor of the frequency of parasitic interactions to occur within an ant genus.  Neither species richness of invaded ant genera nor their ecological prevalence or geographical distribution contributed significantly to that model.  Some large & dominant ant genera, which comprise important visitors of ant-mutualistic lycaenids, have no (Formica, Dolichoderus) or very few ant-parasitic butterflies (Lasius, Polyrhachis) associated with them.]",

    "abstract": "*[All ants live in social groups, in which workers care for the queen's offspring.  This social brood care behavior can be exploited by other species; a life style, which has been called social parasitism.  Social parasitism also occurs in bees and wasps, but it is especially common & diverse in ants.  A third of all native ant species live either during the founding phase or life-long socially parasitic.  Slavemaking ants steal heterospecific larvae or pupae from neighboring host nests, which once they emerge care as slave workers for the offspring of their oppressors.  Slavery evolved repeatedly in ants & in diverse taxonomic groups.  In most cases, social parasites exploit closely related species.   Slavemaking ants developed diverse adaptations to their parasitic lifestyle.  These include weapons, such as saber-shaped mandibles & a strong stinger, coordinated behavioral strategies, & chemical tricks, such as mimicking the host odor to facilitate nest infiltration, or chemical weapons, such as glandular secretions, which manipulate the hosts' behavior in such a way that the slavemakers can rob the host nest without risk.  Host exploitation & the fitness costs of social parasitism lead to the evolution of counter-adaptations & in the end to an endless process of reciprocal adaptation, which has been described as a co-evolutionary arms race.  Host defense strategies can be complex & diverse & include effective enemy recognition, counter attack or flight, & slave rebellion (enslaved workers attack their oppressors' brood to kill them).  The complexity & expression of these defense traits depends on the selection pressure exerted by the parasite, which is the motor of this coevolution.]",

Results include the synonymy of P. gibberosa rogeri, the rising to new status of P. gibberosa albimaculata, & the description of Prenolepis karstica n.sp.   The Antillean species form a monophyletic group which is apparently the most derived of the genus.  The group is characterized by large size, slender morphology, & arboreal or limestone habitats.  Prenolepis karstica is apparently involved in a mimetic relationship with Leptothorax poeyi.  Paratrechina longicornis, used as outgroup (together with Paratrechina fulva & Lasius niger), was the sister taxon of the Antillean clade.  The topology of the phylogenetic relationships was: (((((((karstica-albimaculata) gibberosa) longicornis) naoroji) jerdoni) emmae) imparis, nitens) acuminata).  These results support Trager's (1984) suggestion of a close relation between the Paratrechina longicornis group & Prenolepis species, as well as the general relations of Cuban species presented by Wheeler (1930).  The Indian species Prenolepis naoroji is the sister species of the clade P. longicornis.]",

This report amalgamates previously published records & recent extensive surveys of Christmas Island's ant fauna.  Eight species represent new records for Christmas Island: Technomyrmex vitiensis, Camponotus sp. (novaehollandiae group), Cardiocondyla kagutsuchi, Monomorium orientale, M. cf. subcoecum, Tetramorium cf. simillimum, T. smithi, & T. walshi.  Although some of these new species records represent recent taxonomic advances rather than new introductions, we consider 4 species to be true new records to Christmas Island.  These include Camponotus sp. (novaehollandiae group), M. orientale, T. smithi, & T. walshi.  None of the 52 species reported here are considered endemic.  In general, the Christmas Island ant fauna is composed of species that are regarded as worldwide tramps, or that are widespread in the Indo-Australian region.  However, Christmas Island may fall within the native range of some of these species. We provide a key to the ant species of Christmas Island (based on the worker caste), supplemented by comprehensive distribution maps of these ants on Christmas Island, with a short synopsis of each species in relation to their ecology & world-wide distribution.]",

The mechanism of evolution by natural selection of such sterility & similar forms of altruism has long been considered as a paradox.  In recent years, a large body of theoretical ideas has accumulated that purports to explain altruistic behavior within the framework of the theory of natural selection.  With special reference to insect sociality, 3 theories (kin selection, parental manipulation, & mutualism) have been suggested.  Some attempts have now been made to empirically test the mutually exclusive predictions arising out of these alternative theories.  A somewhat different approach to empirically distinguishing between kin selection & parental manipulation is to measure sex-investment ratios.  This approach was at one time believed to have provided overwhelming support in favor of the theory of kin selection.  It has now been realized that several complicating factors such as local mate competition & multiple mating have to be considered before arriving at appropriate theoretical predictions of the 2 rival theories.  I argue in this paper that rigorous quantitative studies on inter-individual variations in behavioral strategies in primitively eusocial insects constitutes yet another approach that is likely to help in understanding the forces that mould the evolution of insect societies.]",

    "abstract": "*[Kin selection is a widely invoked mechanism to explain the origin & evolution of social behavior in animals.  Proponents of the theory of kin selection place great emphasis on the correlation between asymmetries in genetic relatedness created by haplodiploidy & the multiple origins of eusociality in the order Hymenoptera.  The fact that a female is more closely related genetically to her full sister than to her daughters makes it more profitable for a Hymenopteran female, in terms of inclusive fitness, to raise full sisters rather than daughters or full siblings with a female biased sex ratio rather than offspring.  This is sometimes referred to as the haplodiploidy hypothesis.  In reality however, genetic relatedness between workers in social insect colonies & the reproductive brood they rear is far below 0.75, the value expected for full sisters, often below 0.5 the value expected between mother and daughter &, not uncommonly, approaching zero.  Such values are on account of queen turnover, multiple mating by queens or polygyny.  This situation raises doubts regarding the haplodiploidy hypothesis, unless workers can discriminate between full & half sisters & preferentially direct their altruism towards their full sisters only.  This would still mean and an effective coefficient of genetic relatedness of 0.75 between altruist & recipient.  For this to be possible however, workers should be able to recognise their full sisters inspite of growing up with & being habituated to an assortment of full sisters, half sisters, & perhaps other even less related individuals.  Much effort is now going into assessing the abilities of animals to discriminate between kin and non kin. In every case studied carefully so far, animals appear to be capable of recognising their kin. Ants & others appear to be able to recognize their kin in one circumstance or another.  An ability to recognize true genetic relatedness requires genetically specified recognition labels & these must therefore be present.  Recent findings of the role of the histocompatibility system provides some clues to the possible nature of recognition labels.  An ability to recognize full sisters for example, inspite of being habituated to full & half sisters requires not merely genetically specified labels, but also recognition templates which are based on the characteristics of the individual animals making the recognition & not templates based on all animals one grows up with.]",

    "abstract": "*[Pheidole megacephala occupied almost 30% of the island's total land area, reaching extremely high densities in some areas.  The ant was associated with exotic hemipteran scale insects through trophobiotic mutualisms that facilitated high ant & hemipteran abundances.  The highly destructive scale insect Pulvinaria urbicola was among the hemipterans that benefited from ant attendance.  High levels of hemipteran feeding resulted in dieback of functionally important & threatened native Pisonia trees, which represented a significant threat to the forest ecosystem.  A management program was initiated in response to this threat, consisting of baiting with selective hydramethylnon-based bait delivered in bait stations, accompanied by detailed pre-baiting& post-baiting monitoring.  The method was highly effective at suppressing the ants, whilst preventing bait uptake by non-target organisms.  After ant control, the ant-scale mutualism was decoupled & the Pu. urbicola population collapsed. There were variable responses in different taxa to the removal of these highly abundant exotic species, the most important of which was the recovery in Pisonia trees.  Soil surface arthropods, a group that may have been vulnerable to the treatment method, were unaffected by baiting.  Instead, they increased significantly after ant removal, confirming the ant's impact on other arthropods.  Other ant diversity & non-ant arthropod abundance increased post-baiting, including the endemic ant Pheidole flavens farquharensis & some functionally important insects such as the Indian cockroach.]",

The nectar glands establish a nectar influence zone with a radius of 60 cm around the plant within which seed dispersal by ants is effective.  Seed dispersal by ants is facilitated only if the seeds are placed within this nectar influence zone.  This is accomplished by an intriguing evolutionary shift in the maturation pattern of the fruits.  Fruit maturation in Croton is temporally asymmetrical, with the fruits nearer the parental axis maturing early.  This unique pattern of fruit development together with the polychasial branching system leads to a concentration of seeds within the nectar influence zone & enhances seed dispersal by ants.]",

Foraging individuals of the ant Camponotus sericius feed on the nectar in the nectary glands of female flowers. The pattern of movement of ants while foraging between these regularly placed inflorescences was highly systematic and distinctly exploratory. The ants tended to visit new inflorescences at each move and avoided revisiting inflorescences. They followed this foraging pattern by adopting circular movements either to the left or to the right and avoiding other complex but equally effective moves. This was probably due to memory constraints. The ants predicted the resource quality of the subset of a patch by sampling a part of it. The inflorescences within a cluster were similar in quality. Using this relation ants could make decisions about continuing to forage in a cluster after sampling any one inflorescence. If the first inflorescence visited was of good quality they continued to forage on the rest of the cluster while if the first inflorescence was of poor quality, they abandoned the cluster. This ensured efficient foraging with minimal expenditure of time and energy.",

Ants, solely by their presence on bud bracts & bracteoles, intimidate other insects, either pollinators or herbivores.

Extrafloral nectar production on the bracts of flower buds, which attracts ants to inflorescences, was highest at night, attracting the largest numbers of ants at that time, whereas the major pollinators were active during the day.  This extrafloral nectar production declines after the first flower of each inflorescence opens. The anthers &stigma are placed at the apex of a thin elongate axis, which offers a precarious foothold to ants.  One ant species, Crematogaster dohrni, succeeds despite these difficulties by acting just before the flower opens, & damaging the flower when the style and stamens are still folded.  This is the fourth case of castration behavior of a plant-ant directed against its host-plant.

    "abstract": "The fitness advantage provided by caulinary domatia to myrmecophytes has never been directly demonstrated because most myrmecophytic species do not present any individual variation in the presence of domatia and the removal of domatia from entire plants is a destructive process. The semi-myrmecophytic tree, Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae), is an ideal species to investigate the selective advantage conferred by domatia because within the same population, some plants are devoid of domatia while others bear them. Several ant species patrol the plant for extra-floral nectar. Fruit production was found to be enhanced in domatia-bearing trees compared to trees devoid of domatia independent of the ant associate. However, this domatium effect was most conspicuous for trees associated with the populous and nomadic ant, Technomyrmex albipes. This species is a frequent associate of H. brunonis, inhabiting its domatia or building carton nests on it. Ant exclusion experiments revealed that T. albipes was the only ant to provide efficient anti-herbivore protection to the leaves of its host tree. Measures of ant activity as well as experiments using caterpillars revealed that the higher efficiency of T. albipes was due to its greater patrolling density and consequent shorter lag time in attacking the larvae. T. albipes also provided efficient anti-herbivore protection to flowers since fruit initiation was greater on ant-patrolled inflorescences than on those from which ants were excluded. We therefore demonstrated that caulinary domatia provide a selective advantage to their host-plant and that biotic defense is potentially the main fitness benefit mediated by domatia. However, it is not the sole advantage. The general positive effect of domatia on fruit set in this ant-plant could reflect other benefits conferred by domatia-inhabitants, which are not restricted to ants in this myrmecophyte, but comprise a large diversity of other invertebrates. Our results indicate that mutualisms enhance the evolution of myrmecophytism.",

    "abstract": "In comparison to the large amount of study on the communication abilities of females in ant societies and their associated chemical ecology and sensory physiology, such study of male ants has been largely ignored; accordingly, little is known about their olfactory sensory capabilities. To address this, we explored peripheral odor sensitivities in male Harpegnathos saltator by measuring the electrophysiological activity of olfactory sensory neurons within antennal trichoid and coeloconic sensilla using an extracellular recording technique. In an initial trial of 46 compounds, sensilla trichodea responded strongly to two alarm pheromone components, while a limited number of non-hydrocarbon odorants elicited strong responses in sensilla coeloconica. Both sensillar types responded indifferently to 31 cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) and synthetic long-chain hydrocarbons (HCs) typically found on insect cuticle. In a search for sensilla responding to CHCs and other compounds, we found some sensilla that responded to synthetic HCs and CHCs from virgin queen postpharyngeal glands that are potentially used in close range mate recognition. Olfactometer bioassays of male ants to 15 non-HCs correlated sensory responsiveness to the respective behavioral responses. Comparing olfactory responses between H. saltator males and females, we found that sensilla coeloconica and basiconica of workers showed greater responses and broader selectivity to all compounds. The rarity of CHC-responding trichoid sensilla in Harpegnathos males suggests a more specific role in sexual communication compared to that in females, which use CHCs in a broader communication context.          *[Ants used in this study were derived from colonies originating from India.]",

Using the ant Diacamma indicum Santschi, 1920 as the model system, we compared the relocation dynamics & work organization in brood-depleted (B-) colonies & brood-enhanced (B+) colonies with unmanipulated colonies.  Upon performing 43 relocation experiments & examining 2516 unique transports, we found that B- colonies did not derive any significant advantage during transportation compared with brood intact control colonies.  The sole reproductive female did not receive any special attention during the relocation in B- colonies.  B+ colonies had a significantly lower probability of relocating despite having information about the location & quality of the new nest.  However, B+ colonies that did relocate showed a significantly higher latency to start transportation; but having started, they performed relocation without any significant difference in time or work distribution.  The colonies collectively adjusted their behavior to accommodate & transport the additional brood in brood-enhanced colonies without spending extra time or doing more transports.  We conclude that D. indicum ants have integrated brood transport with the relocation process in a seamless manner & can flexibly adjust their behavior to transport their future reproductive & workforce with them, when they occupy new nests without paying any additional cost.

This species also exhibited a positive relationship with lead content of the soil of each site & the relationship was found to be quite significant at 2 sites.  Considerable low deposition of lead in the body tissue of S. geminata, in comparison to other dorninant species, suggests probable better excretory functioning.  In addition to S. geminata, only 4 other species (Pheidole roberti, Meranoplus bicolor, Telramorium walshi, Monomorium floricola) were recorded to be dominant by individual contribution of 10% or more to the total ant community, but their degree of dominance varied at different sites.  These species were supposed to be tolerant to lead pollution, but they had a  comparatively high deposition of lead in their body tissue, suggesting a less physiological adaptability in comparison to S. geminata in such a polluted environment.  None of these species is likely to be considered as a real competitor of S. geminata.  Species diversity of ants was found to be inversely related with soil lead pollution level; a maximum of 20 species were found at East Kolkata site where lead pollution was at a minimum & only 13 species were recorded from North Kolkata site where the lead pollution was at a maximum.",

The first, the subepithelial gland, was previously undescribed in ants, and is found throughout the body just beneath the epithelium. This gland consists of independent secretory units, each made up of a single gland cell and an associated duct cell that penetrates the cuticle. Its ultrastructural appearance is consistent with possible hydrocarbon production. Examining 84 ant species, the subepithelial gland was found in eight subfamilies (out of 13), although not necessarily in all species. In a single ant species, Harpegnathos saltator, it was the epithelium itself that was enlarged and functioned as a gland. The enlarged epithelial cells secrete their products directly onto the cuticle through distinct cuticular crevasses.

The reservoir of queens typically has a columnar epithelium in the hilar region, near the opening of the sperm duct, whereas the epithelium in the distal region is cuboidal.  Abundant mitochondria together with apical microvilli & basal invaginations indicate an osmoregulatory function.

    "abstract": "Present investigation was aimed to assess the anthophiles of Luffa acutangula and their contribution to pollination. For this, number of visits made by each species of anthophile and their foraging behaviour in a L. acutangula orchard not supplemented with bee colonies were studied. Eight species of insect anthophiles visiting L. acutangula flower were recorded. Hymenoptera was the dominant order followed by Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. During the present study, Xylocopa collaris, X. tenuiscapa, X. aestuans, X. violacea and Pelopidas mathias visited more flowers per unit time and spent more time on flowers increasing the probability of stigma contact and fertilization. Thus, from the study, it can be concluded that these insects may serve as important pollinator for organic and sustainable agriculture of L. acutangula. Coccinelid beetle (Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata), pumpkin beetle (Aulacophora palliata) and ant (Lasius niger) had lower contribution to pollination.",

Wint., five of which were also resistant to apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh), growing on three different rootstocks (EMVII, MM1106, and MM111), indicated a faunal composition consisting of eight orders from which 31 taxa in 21 families were identified. Among the 14 most frequently found groups in descending frequency were aphids, Aphis pomi De Geer and Dysaphis plantaginea Passerini; leafminer, Phyllonorycter blancardella (F.); plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst); codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.); ants, Lasius neoniger (Emery) and Prenolepis imparis (Say); leafhoppers, Empoasca maligna Walsh, Jikradia olitoria (Say), Penthimia americana (Fitch), Scaphytopius sp., and Typhlocyba pomaria McAtee; tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois); green fruitworm, Lithophane antennata (Walker); flea beetle genera (unidentified); ladybird beetles, Adalia bipunctata (L.), Anatis sp., Brachiacantha ursina (F.), Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, Myzia pullata (Say), and Olla v. nigrum Mulsant; apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh); redbanded leafroller, Argyrotaenia velutinana (Walker); lacewing, Chrysopa carnea (Stevens); and green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Say). Direct inverse relationships were found between numbers of identified pests and predators. Significant differences in the incidence of arthropods were found among rootstocks and among selections. Based on these findings, we used a modified program of insecticides only (azinphosmethyl and carbaryl and fenvalerate and phosmet with water as the control applied 9, 36, and 81 d after full bloom), and obtained greater than or equal to 80% fruit without any, arthropod damage. The total crop was evaluated from fruit set to harvest. The cost of chemicals per hectare for the azinphosmethyl and carbaryl program was $83.40; for the fenvalerate and phosmet program, the cost was $136.30. Reductions in pesticide costs of $1,387.40 per hectare needed for an eight spray program to control pests and diseases can be achieved if commercially grown cultivars are replaced by resistant cultivars.

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are largely thought to be contemporary, having recently increased sharply in the wake of globalization. However, human commerce had already become global by the mid-16th century when the Spanish connected the New World with Europe and Asia via their Manila galleon and West Indies trade routes. We use genetic data to trace the global invasion of one of the world's most widespread and invasive pest ants, the tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata. Our results reveal a pattern of introduction of Old World populations that is highly consistent with historical trading routes suggesting that Spanish trade introduced the tropical fire ant to Asia in the 16th century. We identify southwestern Mexico as the most likely source for the invasive populations, which is consistent with the use of Acapulco as the major Spanish port on the Pacific Ocean. From there, the Spanish galleons brought silver to Manila, which served as a hub for trade with China. The genetic data document a corresponding spread of S. geminata from Mexico via Manila to Taiwan and from there, throughout the Old World. Our descriptions of the worldwide spread of S. geminata represent a rare documented case of a biological invasion of a highly invasive and globally distributed pest species due to the earliest stages of global commerce.  Samples of the 3 most closely related species to S. geminata (S. xyloni, S. amblychila, S. aurea) were used as outgroups for the phylogenetic analyses.

    "abstract": "AIM: One of the most consistent global biogeographic patterns is the latitudinal diversity gradient where species richness peaks within the equatorial tropics and decreases towards the poles. Here, we explore the global biogeography of socially parasitic ant species, which comprises the most diverse group of social parasites in the Hymenoptera. We test the biogeographic hypothesis that ant social parasites are distributed along an inverse latitudinal diversity gradient (iLDG) by peaking in diversity outside of the equatorial tropics, which would contrast with the biogeographic pattern observed in free\u0010living, non\u0010parasitic ant species. LOCATION: Global. TAXON: Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). METHODS: We assembled a comprehensive biogeographic dataset consisting of 6001 geographic distribution records for all 371 taxonomically described socially parasitic ant species. We used phylogenetic and taxonomic studies to estimate the number of independent evolutionary origins of ant social parasitism to directly compare species richness with the number of species representing independent evolutionary origins of social parasitism across a latitudinal gradient. In addition, we compared ant social parasite diversity across biogeographic regions using rarefaction to account for different sampling efforts. Finally, we tested for a correlation between latitude and the proportion of ant social parasite species within regional ant faunae. RESULTS: The geographic distribution records and the inferred 91 independent evolutionary origins of socially parasitic life histories in ants show that both species richness and the number of species representing independent evolutionary origins of social parasitism peak in the northern hemisphere outside of the equatorial tropics. Based on rarefaction curves, northern latitude regions harbour the most ant social parasite species, but the diversity of independent evolutionary origins is not significantly different between northern and southern hemispheres. The proportion of ant social parasite species within regional faunae is tightly correlated with latitude only in the northern hemisphere. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The iLDG of ant social parasites contrasts with the biogeographic pattern observed in free\u0010living, non\u0010parasitic ant species and appears to be driven by large species radiations as well as by the presence of specialized life histories exclusive to the northern hemisphere.",

    "abstract": "In multiply invaded ecosystems, introduced species should interact with each other as well as with native species. Invader-invader interactions may affect the success of further invaders by altering attributes of recipient communities and propagule pressure. The invasional meltdown hypothesis (IMH) posits that positive interactions among invaders initiate positive population\u0010level feedback that intensifies impacts and promotes secondary invasions. IMH remains controversial: few studies show feedback between invaders that amplifies their effects, and none yet demonstrate facilitation of entry and spread of secondary invaders. Our results show that supercolonies of an alien ant, promoted by mutualism with introduced honeydew\u0010secreting scale insects, permitted invasion by an exotic land snail on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Modeling of land snail spread over 750 sites across 135 km2 over seven years showed that the probability of land snail invasion was facilitated 253\u0010fold in ant supercolonies but impeded in intact forest where predaceous native land crabs remained abundant. Land snail occurrence at neighboring sites, a measure of propagule pressure, also promoted land snail spread. Site comparisons and experiments revealed that ant supercolonies, by killing land crabs but not land snails, disrupted biotic resistance and provided enemy\u0010free space. Predation pressure on land snails was lower (28.6%), survival 115 times longer, and abundance 20\u0010fold greater in supercolonies than in intact forest. Whole\u0010ecosystem suppression of supercolonies reversed the probability of land snail invasion by allowing recolonization of land crabs; land snails were much less likely (0.79%) to invade sites where supercolonies were suppressed than where they remained intact. Our results provide strong empirical evidence for IMH by demonstrating that mutualism between invaders reconfigures key interactions in the recipient community. This facilitates entry of secondary invaders and elevates propagule pressure, propagating their spread at the whole\u0010ecosystem level. We show that identification and management of key facilitative interactions in invaded ecosystems can be used to reverse impacts and restore resistance to further invasions.",

    "abstract": "Distant tropical coral sand islets in the Coral Sea have remained isolated from major human interference since their relatively recent inception. As a result they have highly impoverished faunas and floras consisting only of species capable of long distance dispersal. Despite this bias, they have established some degree of stability or equilibrium. In the 1990s, it became apparent that a scale insect, Pulvinaria urbicola Cockerell and at least one species of attendant ant, Tetramorium bicarinatum (Nylander) were undergoing a population explosion on two of these islets causing damage to Pisonia grandis, a tree important as a nesting site for sea birds. The same phenomenon as in the Coral Sea, (Coringa Herald group), was recorded about the same time in the Capricorn group of islets (Great Barrier Reef), on Palmyra Atoll and Samoa in the Pacific and in the Seychelles (Indian Ocean). Control measures, the application of systemic insecticides, poisoning of attendant ants and introduction of biological control agents were applied to some islands. Pest numbers subsequently fell, often within months, even where no control measures were applied, suggesting that the population decline was a natural phenomenon on some sites and not the result of recent invasions. It is suggested that climate variability is likely to be a contributing factor. Rising sea surface temperatures that reduce prey available to sea birds so causing a lower nitrogen input to soils during nesting activities, together with drier conditions, are likely to have put Pisonia trees under stress. Stressed trees mobilize nutrients making them more vulnerable to attack by herbivores. If climate variability is an indirect cause of the pest outbreak, it is important to carefully assess the benefits and disadvantages, both environmentally and economically, of any control measures, especially when biological control agents are concerned, the effects of which are irreversible.",

    "abstract": "The ant subfamily Leptanillinae (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) consists of minute soil-dwelling species, with several genera within this clade being based solely upon males, including Yavnella Kugler. The dissociation of males and workers has resulted in taxonomic confusion for the Leptanillinae. We here describe the worker caste of Yavnella , facilitated by maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference from 473 partitioned ultra-conserved element loci, this dataset including 49 other leptanilline species, both described and undescribed. Yavnella laventa sp. nov. is described from seven worker specimens collected in south-western Iran from the Milieu Souterrain Superficiel , a subterranean microhabitat consisting of air-filled cavities among rock and soil fragments, which is subject to similar environmental conditions as caves. This species has bizarrely elongated appendages, which suggests that it is confined to cavities, in contrast with the soil-dwelling behaviour observed in other leptanilline ants. Based on its gracile phenotype relative to other Leptanillinae, Y. laventa shows remarkable adaptations for subterranean life, making it one of a very few examples of this syndrome among the ants. Moreover, the discovery of the worker caste of Yavnella expands our morphological knowledge of the leptanilline ants. We provide worker- and male-based diagnoses of Yavnella , along with a key to the genera of the Leptanillinae for which workers are known. The worker caste of Yavnella as known from this species is immediately recognisable, but the possibility must be noted that described workers of Leptanilla may in fact belong to Yavnella . Further molecular sampling is required to test this hypothesis.          *[Protanilla wallacei is listed as a Nomen nudum.]",

    "abstract": "Ants of the genus Mystrium employ a peculiar snap-jaw mechanism in which the closed mandibles cross over to deliver a stunning blow to an adversary within about 0.5 ms. The mandible snapping is preceded by antennation and antennal withdrawal. The strike is initiated by contact of the adversary with mechanosensory hairs at the side of the mandible, and is powered by large yet slow closer muscles whose energy is stored by a catapult mechanism. Recording of closer muscle activity indicates that the mandibles are not triggered by any fast muscle. Instead, we suppose that activity differences between the left and right mandible muscles imbalance a pivot at the mandible tip and release the strike. The likelihood for the strike to occur can be modulated by an alarm pheromone. The presence of specialized sensilla and of a complex muscle receptor organ shows that the mandibles are also adapted to functions other than snapping and suggests that the force of the mandible can be finely adjusted for other tasks.            *[A. nr reclinata collected in India, M. rogeri collected in Madagascar; work done in Germany.  A. nr reclinata & M. rogeri behavior & morphology compared.  Evidence of alarm pheromone involvement.  After 2 months in the lab, the queen died, worker production declined, & only males were produced.  Behavior changed from aggressive defense of the nest openings with snapping mandibles on objects, to antennation & withdrawal into the nest.  Other genera listed were found to have an almost identical muscle receptor organ in cursory inspections.]",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary ecologists often seek to explain life history variation at geographical scales. Progress in this regard has been slower in social insects than in unitary organisms, due in part to limited information about species distributions and the complexity of studying colony-level traits. Temnothorax ants have proven useful for investigating associations between ecology and life history traits in ants, because they have small colonies (<200 workers) with substantial variation in traits like queen number within and across populations. Yet most of these studies have focused on <10 Temnothorax species from northern latitudes, although the genus contains >400 species that range from temperate to tropical biomes. Here, we generate the first global map of Temnothorax diversity and demonstrate that previous ecological hypotheses for colony life history variation in the genus are based on data and studies confined to a small part of the overall genus-level distribution. For example, studies of northern-latitude species have suggested that overwintering success is a prominent selective force favoring polygyny but little is known about polygyny in Temnothorax species from other regions. We report the highest observed queen numbers known in the genus in the subtropical species T. tuscaloosae and confirm that all queens in these polygynous colonies are mated and actively laying eggs. Behavioral laboratory experiments further indicate that this species has a fluid nest structure and lacks intraspecific aggression at the whole-forest scale. These results extend the biogeographical extent of life history studies for this genus and point to evolutionary discoveries awaiting comparative research of the global Temnothorax fauna.

    "abstract": "The Asian needle ant, Brachyponera chinensis (Emery) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), is an East Asian species currently spreading through the eastern US. Although not aggressive, B. chinensis has a painful sting that can induce a severe allergic reaction in humans and disrupt native ecological communities. To document the global distribution of B. chinensis and evaluate its potential for further spread, we compiled specimen records from over 780 sites in its native and introduced ranges. Unfortunately, in its native range, B. chinensis often has been confused with morphologically similar species, resulting in some unreliable published distribution records. Therefore, we designated confirmed identification records as 'B. chinensis s.s.' (sensu stricto). Our report chronicles the earliest known records of B. chinensis for 50 geographic areas in the Old World (36 countries and island groups) and New World (17 states in the US) and the recent expansion of B. chinensis into the eastern coast of the Black Sea along with new state distribution records from the US. We also provide new information on the phenology of B. chinensis. This ant species represents a potentially serious public health threat that warrants more epidemiological study.",

However, recent studies suggest that certain faunal components, particularly in the wet zones, are distinct.  This article looks at the existing information on species richness & endemicity of taxa in both regions.  Data are available on some taxa but not on others, & many taxa have not received equal attention in both regions.  The natural ecosystems of this hotspot are under threat & urgent conservation action is needed, especially in augmenting the protected area network.   Historical records documented about 210 species of ant in 65 genera & 12 subfamilies for Sri Lanka, including the endemic relict ant Aneuretus simoni Emery.  A recent study conducted in dipterocarp-dominated forest of the Sinharaja Biosphere Reserve recorded 173 species of ground-dwelling ants in 54 genera & 11 subfamilies.  In comparison, a recent study collected 140 species in 32 genera from 12 localities in the Western Ghats.]",

    "abstract": "Ants are chemical factories, and among their more noticeable products are their venoms. Though many studies have addressed the properties and activities of ant venoms, basic venom-related physiological questions, such as how venom production and replacement may vary with age, are rarely addressed. The answers to these questions are fundamental to understanding the physiological capabilities of these organisms, as well as the parameters within which potential optimization of their investment in venom production must take place. The only previous investigation into venom production in ants found it to be limited to early life in workers of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (Haight and Tschinkel, 2003). Because similar studies have not been conducted for comparison, it is unclear whether or not this is a common physiological pattern in ants. As a parsimonious way to address this question, and, more generally, to increase the currently scant information available regarding the venom-producing capabilities of ants, the longevity, temporal polyethism, age-related venom production, and age-related venom replacement capabilities of workers of Jerdon\u0019s jumping ant, Harpegnathos saltator were investigated. Longevity varied from 10days to nearly 2years, with a median lifespan of 206days. Workers remained in the nest when young, transitioned to outside work (foraging) after 50days of age, and reached a plateau in their tendency to be outside the nest at 74days of age. They eclosed with empty venom sacs, filled them by about 57days of age, and were able to replace venom at all three ages tested (though at a higher rate when aged 100days than 30 and 206). So, venom-production ability is not limited to early life in H. saltator workers, and aspects of venom physiology and exploratory behavior appear to coincide in a manner likely to result in foraging efficiency benefits; venom sacs reach fullness around the age workers begin their foraging careers, and venom replacement rate is highest around the age workers become the most dedicated foragers.          *[All H. saltator colonies used in this work were descendents of those collected by Liebig et al. (1998) from the Western Ghats in southern India.  The ants were maintained in the laboratory, since that time.]",

    "abstract": "In Mauritius, the endemic blue-tailed day-gecko Phelsuma cepediana is currently the sole pollinator and seed disperser of the critically endangered endemic plant Roussea simplex (Rousseaceae). The flowers and fruits are often visited by the invasive ant Technomyrmex albipes, which forages on the nectar and fruit pulp, and tends honeydew-producing mealybugs on the fruits. Here, we experimentally explore how the presence of this alien ant species influences geckos foraging at flowers and fruits of R. simplex by removing and excluding ants from flowers and fruits. Gecko visitation rates to ant-free control flowers and fruits, and flowers and fruits where ants had been removed and excluded, were higher than those to ant-infested flowers and fruits. The resulting seed set of ant-infested flowers was greatly reduced, compared to ant-free control flowers. Similarly, for fruits with ants, very few seeds were likely to be ingested and dispersed by the geckos. Thus, T. albipes monopolizes flowers and fruits of R. simplex, and prevents access of pollinating and seed-dispersing P. cepediana geckos by aggressive interference competition. For a critically endangered plant like R. simplex, this double-disruption of two vital mutualistic interactions is of urgent conservation concern.",

In the case of the invasive Argentine ant, we found that it was most likely to occur where the mean daily temperature in mid-winter was 7-14 ∞C and maximum daily temperatures during the hottest month averaged 19-30 ∞C. Uninvaded regions vulnerable to future establishment include: southern China, Taiwan, Zimbabwe, central Madagascar, Morocco, high-elevation Ethiopia, Yemen and a number of oceanic islands. Greatest uncertainty exists over predictions for China, North-east India, Angola, Bolivia, Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia.

    "abstract": "Integration of morphological and molecular approaches is nowadays given importance to identify a particular species. So in our study, we considered both approaches to identify the controversial ant species, Odontoponera denticulata. For morphological analysis, we considered morphological characters and morphometric measurements. In the molecular approach, we considered DNA barcoding from the COI gene. A nucleotide sequence of 641 base pairs was obtained which showed 86.08% similarity with Odontoponera transversa. No COI gene sequence of O. denticulata is found to exist in Genbank. But morphological characters supported the identity of the species as O. denticulata. Therefore, the sequence obtained was submitted to NCBI Genbank (accession number MN380424). From the study, it can be inferred that the combination of both the morphological and molecular approaches is helpful to identify a species, here in this case the Ponerine ant, O. denticulata. As there is no report on antennal sensilla of O. denticulata, therefore we also investigated the morphology and distribution of antennal sensilla of O. denticulata. Nine different types of antennal sensilla are recorded including Bˆhm Bristles (BB1, BB2), Sensilla Trichodea (ST1, ST2), Sensilla Chaetica (SCh), Sensilla Basiconica (SB1, SB2), Sensilla Coeloconica (SCo) and Sensilla Campaniformia (SCa).

In the present investigation, we evaluate the insecticidal and repellent activities of edible, medicinal, plant-based EOs of Allium sativum, Curcuma longa, Ocimum sanctum and Syzygium aromaticum against two household ant species, namely Camponotus compressus and Dolichoderus affinis. Among the four essential oils, Allium sativum oil showed the most potential insecticidal effect with LC50 value of 1.71 µl/250 mL air against Camponotus compressus and 2.32 µl/250 mL air against Dolichoderus affinis, while Syzygium aromaticum oil showed the highest repellency against both the targeted ant species. From the findings, we could infer that the selected plant EOs are potential candidates for household ant control as they are effective, extracted from edible products and hence safe for consumption.",

The dome-shaped nests may vary considerably depending on age of the colony & the habitat; however, they are typically 0.5 m in height & 1.0-1.5 m in diameter.  The main brood chambers typically extend to a depth of 1 m or more below the soil surface, & the thatch to a depth of one-third of a meter or less.  The thatch nests are constructed from dry plant materials found in the area, such as pine needles & twigs in a pine forest or sagebrush twigs & grass in a semi-arid region.]",

    "abstract": "*[Baited transects were used to study the assemblages of ants in the Kalahari & Kara-Kum deserts & across dunes, a plain, & a dry riverbed in the Namib Desert.  Species-richness was related to amount of vegetation, with the shrub desert of the Kalahari having over twice as many species as the other, more severe deserts.  The point species-richness increased with overall species-richness up to an asymptote of 5 species.  The mean number of species occurring at baits stabilized at slightly more than one species.  The assemblages were inequitable, with one to 3 species accounting for most of the visits to baits.  In the more highly vegetated deserts foraging ants examined virtually the entire desert floor on a daily basis.  In the Namib, most species of ants were scavengers or omnivores; no strict granivores were found.  In the other deserts only the scavenger guild was studied.  In all deserts, ants dominated the scavenger guild, with other taxa coming to sardine baits only infrequently.  Foraging took place more often at night & in the morning than in the middle of the day; at most sites it was more intense on the ground than in shrubs.  The Kara-Kum differed in that most activity was associated with shrubs.  The three most common species in the Namib were partially segregated on the basis of different times of peak activity.  No overt combat was observed, & in the less speciose assemblages there was no evidence of interference.  With increasing species-richness, however, there was exclusion of some species from baits, & in the Kalahari a dominance hierarchy was observed.  Crematogaster subdentata, Monomoriuim barbatulum, Monomorium indicum kusnezowi, & Tetramorium caespitum were found in the Kara-Kum desert; the remaing species are from Namibia.]",

    "abstract": "Understanding an organism\u0019s phenology is crucial for predicting the effects of anthropogenic impacts like climate change. Yet we lack a basic understanding of reproductive timing in one of Earth\u0019s most prominent animal groups\u0014the ants. I perform the first large-scale study of the geography of ant mating phenology by synthesizing collection data from museum databases. By compiling museum records of specimens in reproductive condition from across the contiguous U.S. and dating back over a century, I explore how ant mating seasons vary with latitude and elevation and test whether they have shifted in response to climate change. Ant mating seasons occurred about 1 day later in the year for each 100-m gain in elevation or degree increase in latitude and were also shorter and less variable at higher latitudes. Consistent with predicted impacts of climate change, 25% of native species have shifted their mating seasons earlier by an average of 0.9 days per year. Across all ants, mating dates have been advancing about 1 day earlier per decade. The results represent the first attempt at a regional geography of ant mating phenology and highlight shifts in mating season as a mechanism mediating the responses of ants to climate change.

    "abstract": "Dispersal in social parasites is constrained by the presence of suitable host populations, limiting opportunities for rapid range expansion. For this reason, although hundreds of ant species have expanded their ranges through human transport, few obligate social parasites have done so. We test the hypothesis that social parasites expand their ranges more slowly than their hosts by examining the spread of an introduced social parasite-host species pair in North America\u0014the workerless ant Tetramorium atratulum and the pavement ant T. immigrans. In doing so we report a new range extension of T. atratulum in the interior US. Consistent with host limitation on dispersal, we found a time lag ranging from several years to over a century between the arrivals of the host and parasite to a new region. The estimated maximum rate of range expansion in the parasite was only a third as fast as that of the host. We suggest that relative to free-living social insects, social parasites may be less able to rapidly shift their ranges in response to changes in habitat or climate.",

Mass consumption of collembolans occurred in late August.  Pitfall trap sampling showed that collembolans increased explosively at this time of year.  This synchronization suggests that the frog feeds on this tiny insect unselectively in response to the increase of its availability within the habitat.  The unspecialized feeding habits may partially explain the dominant distribution of this frog in the river-floodplain, where the arthropod fauna is unpredictably devastated by inundation.]",

All former species groups were redefined, & several new groups were established, in order to accommodate the substantial amount of new material.  We propose 14 species groups of Tetramorium for this region.  Morphological boundaries between these groups & their biogeographic affinities are discussed, & an illustrated identification key to species groups is provided.  Diagnoses of all species groups are presented, as well as images of typical group members.  Additionally, the species level taxonomy of the T. bicarinatum, T. obesum, T. sericeiventre and T. tosii species groups is revised with descriptions & images of all species.  An identification key to the species of the T. bicarinatum group is provided.  No nomenclatorial changes are documented from the T. bicarinatum, T. obesum, & T. tosii groups.

    "abstract": "Clavigeritae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pselaphinae) comprise a supertribe of specialized myrmecophile rove beetles that display numerous behavioural, chemical and anatomical modifications associated with a socially parasitic lifestyle. Due to the extreme morphological diversity of clavigerites, their systematic relationships, patterns of character evolution and host ant use have been challenging to infer. Here, we resolve deep divergences within Clavigeritae by assembling a molecular dataset encompassing the breadth of tribal diversity. We classify Clavigeritae into six tribes: extinct Protoclavigerini, and recent Tiracerini, Mastigerini sensu nov., Clavigerini sensu nov., Lunillini sensu nov. and Disarthricerini stat. nov. The previously recognized subtribes Clavigerodina, Apoderigerina, Dimerometopina, Hoplitoxenina, Miroclavigerina, Theocerina and Thysdarina are demonstrated as polyphyletic or highly derived internal clades of Clavigerini and are hereby synonymized with the latter. Colilodion \u0013 a highly enigmatic taxon proposed to be the earliest\u0010branching lineage of recent Clavigeritae \u0013 is revealed to be unrelated to Clavigeritae and is transferred to Pselaphitae. We provide a systematic treatment of newly\u0010discovered endemic genera from New Caledonia and infer their phylogenetic affinity to the Australian tribe Tiracerini. The zoogeographic distribution of early\u0010branching Clavigeritae lineages in India and the Australian region indicates a possible Gondwanan origin of the supertribe. Extant clades diversified from the Eocene onwards, correlated with the rise of modern ants. We present evidence for island radiations of Clavigeritae in both Madagascar and New Caledonia during the Oligocene\u0010Miocene. Using a newly\u0010created morphological dataset, we analyse patterns of character evolution and demonstrate widespread convergence in morphology that extends to virtually all traits. Counterintuitively, however, characters postulated to be involved in beetle\u0010ant communication are amongst the most invariant, and least convergent. The host ant spectrum of many Clavigeritae genera and species is broad, contradicting co\u0010cladogenesis with hosts and instead implying widespread host switching. We speculate whether morphological variability in Clavigeritae is truly adaptive, as opposed to the product of \u0018morphological drift\u0019 of body parts under weak selection inside ant colonies, in species with potentially very small effective population sizes.",

    "abstract": "*[The present study focuses on the effect of western harvester ants on pedogenesis & soil productivity in a semiarid environment dominated by big sage (Artemesia tridentata).  Ant colony &vegetation associations were compared between contiguous uncultivated, fallow (or abandoned), & cultivated fields in the E part of the Zuni Indian Reservation, west-central New Mexico.  Western harvester ants increase the porosity, aeration, hydraulic conductivity, nutrient status, & tilth of the soil, especially near the surface where their burrowing activities are concentrated.  Compared to reference soils, ant mound soils generally have lower bulk densities, pH's, & clay contents, & higher levels of organic carbon, nitrogen, & available & total phosphorus,   Highly decomposed organic matter is strongly associated with the walls of ant chambers & tunnels.  Ants expend more energy in burrowing & mound construction activities in cultivated & fallow fields & their colonies are more closely spaced in these locales, because of the concentrated available plant food supply in active & fallow agricultural land.  The soil turnover & nutrient cycling rates are accelerated in cultivated & fallow fields.  The entire surface of the landscape is expected to become modified by ant activity within 1300 to 2500 years.]",

    "abstract": "Many studies suggest a role for biogenic amines in a variety of insect behaviors including intraspecific aggression. In ants, despite a rich behavioral repertoire and prominent aggressive interactions, little is known about the potential impact of biogenic amines.  This may partly be due to the general lack of information about aminergic systems in the ant brain.    The present study investigates serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems in the brain of the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator. In H. saltator, intraspecific aggression is important for the regulation of reproduction. This species, therefore, is amenable to comparative studies of aminergic neuronal effects on long-term changes in aggression. Using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that in the brains of sterile workers, the distributions of serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal processes differed substantially. In addition, branching patterns of serotonergic neurons showed marked differences between males and females. Brains of workers after 3 days and 3 weeks of aggressive interactions revealed no marked differences in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons compared to those of reproductive and non-aggressive individuals. We conclude that different levels of intraspecific aggression do not involve profound anatomical changes in serotonergic and  dopaminergic neurons. Subtle changes may be masked by inter-individual variances.          *[Harpegnathos saltator colonies were initially excavated at Jog Falls, Karnataka State, Southern India in 1994, 1995, & 1999.  Workers of Atta sexdens & Myrmecia gulosa, (kindly provided by O. Geissler & V. Dietemann, University of Wurzburg) were used for comparisons.]",

    "abstract": "*[In our study, we surveyed ant cricket species (Myrmecophilinae) associated with A. gracilipes in the Indo-Pacific region & provided a taxonomic revision using an integrative approach by combining morphological & molecular data.  At least 8 ant cricket species were found in A. gracilipes nests, which represents the greatest number of ant cricket species recorded for a single ant species.  Some of these ant crickets were widespread across the Indo-Pacific & have an overlapping distribution with A. gracilipes.  Haplotype networks showed incongruence between haplotype groupings & geographic distribution of ant cricket species, indicating co-introductions of ant cricket species with their ant hosts have occurred.  A new taxonomic status of related Myrmecophilus species was given: 1) 3 new species were described (Myrmecophilus antilucanus sp.n., Myrmecophilus caliginosus sp.n., & Myrmecophilus ikaros sp.n.), & 2) 3 new synonyms & one resurrection was made (M. quadrispina Perkins, 1899 = M. formosanus Shiraki, 1930 syn.n., M. hebardi Mann, 1920 = M. leei Kistner & Chong, 2007 syn.n., M. dubius Saussure, 1877 = M. flavocinctus Wasmann, 1894 stat.n. & syn.n.; M. mayaealberti Hugel & Matyot, 2006 stat.rev.).  In addition, traits that potentially promote A. gracilipes as a favorable host for ant crickets are discussed, along with potential ecological impacts associated with co-introduced ant crickets in their non-native range.]          *[Other species listed are given in text as hosts of ant crickets.]",

    "abstract": "The karyotypes of 94 species of Indian ants were examined. Their chromosome numbers range almost continuously between n=5 and 38, though the frequency distribution is bimodal with a remarkable antimode at n=11 and two modal points and n=10 and 15. Based on this bimodal distribution, Indian ants were classified into two groups: Lower-numbered species (n<11) and high-numbered species (n >11), the former being characterized by metacentric-rich karyotypes, and acrocentrics predominate in the latter. The three major subfamilies (Ponerinae, Myrmicinae, and Formicinae) showed a highly divergent distribution in chromosome number, ranging between n=7-38, 6-35, and 8-27, respectively, suggesting a convergence in karyotype evolution of each subfamily. Another three subfamilies, of which only a few species were examined, had moderate or lower numbers, i. e., n=5-14 in Dolichoderinae, n=14 in Cerapachyinae, and n=12 in Dorylinae. We found four Robertsonian polymorphisms, two pericentric inversion polymorphisms, and four reciprocal translocations, three of which were fixed. Robertsonian polymorphisms were found only in higher-numbered species, while translocations were restricted to lower-numbered species. A possible biological significance for this nonrandom distribution of rearrangements is discussed with reference to karyotype evolution in ants.          **[Brachyponera luteipes (= obscurans)]",

The Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) is an \u001cendangered\u001d, inimitable mammal currently in jeopardy in Pakistan. Very little data are available about its ecology that could serve as baseline for its conservation. In the current study, we investigated the Indian pangolin\u0019s distribution, abundance and diet in four districts of Potohar Plateau. The species was found evenly distributed in two study districts, while it showed patchy distribution in the remaining two districts, and it occurred up to a maximum elevation of 862 m a.s.l. Population density showed a sharp and significant decline over a period of three years from 2010 to 2013. Faecal matter of the species was found to contain remains of ants (head, abdominal parts, legs) as the second-most voluminous component of the droppings, following soil or clay. Remains of other food sources, like termites, bugs, wood and grasses, were found in minor percentages. Our study reveals that the main prey items of Indian pangolins include two species of black ants (Camponotus confucii and Camponotus compressus), and one species of termite (Odontotermis obesus). The recorded population decline indicates that conservation measures may be needed.",

This paper assesses the abundance, diversity and distribution of insects in urban domestic gardens in the tropics, through a study in the rapidly expanding Indian city of Bangalore. Fifty domestic gardens were studied using a combination of light traps and pitfall traps. We recorded a large number of insects, 2,185 insects from 10 orders, of which ants, bugs, beetles and flies were the most common. We found 25 species of trees (from 160 individuals) and 117 species of herbs and shrubs in the 50 sampled domestic gardens. The number of insect orders encountered was significantly related to the number of tree and herb/shrub species. Garden management practices also influenced the abundance and richness of insect orders. Thus, greater numbers of insects were observed in gardens with a greater proportion of bare soil relative to grass area and with less intensive weeding practices. More insect orders were encountered in gardens with a composting pit. Insect numbers were significantly reduced in gardens subjected to pesticide application. Most residents avoided application of pesticides and herbicides, citing health concerns.",

Both cluster analysis and principal component analysis indicate an effect of industrialization on the diversity of the four insect orders. The species community at each site exhibits an almost pure lognormal distribution. Bootstrap estimation of species diversity also points to the effect of industrialization. A comparison of the values of x and N/S of the logarithmic series indicates a typical relationship between the species community and its diversity. The number of unique species among the eight study sites is 6 according to jackknife estimation. Beta-diversity analysis of the samples shows the impact of industrialization on the abundances and species richness of the insects. Altogether, 16 types of analytical procedure are applied for this purpose, and their suitabilities for this kind of data set are assessed. Disturbance, probably due to industrial emissions, has changed the compositions and structures of the insect communities out to a distance of at least 6 km from the core industrial area.",

Surveys at our field site in south-central Arizona, USA, demonstrated that only one queen phenotype (alate or ergatoid) occurred in each colony during the season in which reproductive sexuals were produced.  A morphometric analysis demonstrated that ergatoid queens retained all specialized anatomical features of alate queens (except for wings), & that they were significantly smaller & had a lower mass than alate queens.  Using 8 morphological characters, a discriminant analysis correctly categorized all queens (40 of 40) of both phenotypes.  A molecular phylogeny using 420 base pairs of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I demonstrated that alate & ergatoid queens are 2 alternative phenotypes within the species; both phenotypes were intermixed on our phylogeny, & both phenotypes often displayed the same haplotype.  A survey of the genus Monomorium (358 species) found that wingless queens (ergatoid queens, brachypterous queens) occur in 42 of 137 species (30.6%) in which the queen has been described.  These wingless queen species are geographically & taxonomically widespread as they occur on several continents & in 8 species groups, suggesting that winglessness probably arose independently on many occasions in the genus.]",

    "abstract": "Many parasites alter the behaviour of their host to their own advantage, yet hosts often vary in their susceptibility to manipulation. The ecological and evolutionary implications of such variation can be profound, as resistant host populations may suffer lower parasite pressures than those susceptible to manipulation. To test this prediction, we assessed parasite-induced aggressive behaviours across 16 populations of two Temnothorax ant species, many of which harbour the slavemaker ant Protomognathus americanus. This social parasite uses its Dufour's gland secretions to manipulate its hosts into attacking nestmates, which may deter defenders away from itself during invasion. We indeed find that colonies that were manipulated into attacking their Dufour-treated nestmates were less aggressive towards the slavemaker than those that did not show slavemaker-induced nestmate attack. Slavemakers benefited from altering their hosts' aggression, as both the likelihood that slavemakers survived host encounters and slavemaker prevalence in ant communities increased with slavemaker-induced nestmate attack. Finally, we show that Temnothorax longispinosus colonies were more susceptible to manipulation than Temnothorax curvispinosus colonies. This explains why T. curvispinosus colonies responded with more aggression towards invading slavemakers, why they were less likely to let slavemakers escape and why they were less frequently parasitized by the slavemaker than T. longispinosus. Our findings highlight that large-scale geographic variation in resistance to manipulation can have important implications for the prevalence and host preference of parasites.",

When successful, collective aggression not only prevents parasitation, but also spares host colonies the cost of searching for & moving to a new nest site.  However, once parasites breach the host's nest defense, host colonies should resort to flight as the more beneficial resistance strategy.  We show that under low parasite pressure, host colonies more likely responded to an intruding Protomognathus americanus slavemaker with collective aggression, which prevented the slavemaker from escaping & potentially recruiting nest-mates.

These 6 species are part of the Formica s. str. subgenus, and build large above-ground organic mounds.  In contrast, the taxonomic usage of the F. rufa group in North America seems to have a much broader meaning than in Europe and Asia.  There are 24 species and subspecies placed in the North American F. rufa group, but only a few build large mounds.  Our survey of the literature indicates that very little is known on the abundance and distribution of North American red wood ants, under what forest conditions they are found, and what role they may have in forest ecosystems.  Environmental conditions (temperature, moisture), disturbances (fire, human), predation, and competition with other ant species are all possible factors that may explain why red wood ants predominate in many Eurasian but not in North American forests.  Detailed studies on the distribution and ecology of red wood ants in North America are needed, especially the interaction and possible competition from carpenter ants (Camponotus spp.) in limiting their distribution.  Finally, studies on the taxonomic relationships of the North American F. rufa group to the Eurasian Formica s. str. subgenus are needed to help understand the origin and development of red wood ants in North America.]",

    "abstract": "The Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) has a wide distribution in the Indian subcontinent and is a threatened species throughout its range due to hunting, poaching, trafficking, and destruction of natural habitats. Many rescue programmes for Indian pangolins have had limited success due to the paucity of literature on the diet, ecology and its behaviour. This study investigated the dietary composition and foraging habitat preference of the Indian pangolin in a tropical lowland forest-associated landscape of Southwest Sri Lanka. Five types of habitat were considered in this study: forest, rubber plantation, cinnamon cultivation, oil palm plantation, and tea-dominated home gardens/cultivated areas. The foraging intensity of Indian pangolin in the five habitat types was assessed using signs of foraging activities observed in five 10 ◊ 10 m plots placed along a transect. Ten transects were established in each habitat assessed. The forest habitat was preferred in the studied landscape, followed by rubber plantations, the cinnamon cultivations, oil palm plantations and the tea-dominated home gardens/cultivated areas. Indian pangolins mostly predated on termites, as indicated by the number of feeding events on termitaria and termite-infested logs. Faecal content analysis further revealed that the undigested matter (by weight) was predominantly composed of grit (53.3%), insect matter (37%) and plant matter (9.7%). The digestibility of termite heads, mouthparts, abdomens, and legs was high compared to that of ants. This difference in digestibility was evident from the presence of significantly more heads, mouthparts, abdomens, and legs of ants in the faecal matter, compared to that of termites. However, undigested termite wings were frequently observed in the faecal matter. Termites of the genus Odontotermes and ants of the genera Oecophylla, Anoplolepis, Camponotus and Monomorium were the main prey species of the Indian pangolin in the studied area. The findings on the dietary composition have implications in captive rearing and husbandry of Indian pangolins. In addition to natural forests, the findings of the study suggest that human-modified agricultural lands adjoining forest also serve as important as foraging habitats for Indian pangolins, and such habitats should be considered in long-term conservation planning.",

The ants were collected from the natural population and maintained in the laboratory keeping them either in a single formicarium or prepared formicaria interconnected with tubes to observe the behavior.  About 8 types of behavioral pattern of ants were noticed.  In case of necrophoresis (carrying of dead nest-mates), the space inside the formicarium was not found to be sufficient to dispose off the dead nest-mates & all the time the workers carried the dead nest-mates haphazardly possibly in search of suitable disposal area.  When the worker ants with dead nest-mates were allowed to leave the formicarium, they left, disposed, & came back to the formicarium.  It was observed that the silk secreting property was not the only a larval character, the adult workers could also secrete some silk.  When the natural hibiscus leaf-nest dried up in the formicarium, the workers along with queens left the natural leaf-nest & made 'tube-nest' in the formicarium.  The workers carried all the larvae & pupae to the newly forming 'tube-nest'.  It was also observed that sometimes workers took the animal food inside the 'tube-nest'.  They were very aggressive towards the intruder ants, but when fellow members, separated for several months were re-introduced, the residents showed almost no aggression.  The maximum number (n = 10) of worker ants were observed as active during the months of May & June.  Afterwards, the number gradually declined to become lowest (n = 3) in the month of January.]         *[Dead Camponotus & other insects were part of the ants diet.]",

Molecular phylogenetic study of these morphologically almost similar taxa has shown that D. ceylonense is closely related to 'nilgiri' & indicates that 'nilgiri' is a recent diversion in the Diacamma phylogenetic tree.  However, there is a striking behavioral difference in the way reproductive monopoly is maintained by the respective gamergates (mated egg laying workers), & there is evidence that they are genetically differentiated, suggesting a lack of gene flow.  To develop a better understanding of the mechanism involved in speciation of Diacamma, we have analysed karyotypes of D. ceylonense & 'nilgiri'.  In both, we found surprising inter-individual & intra-individual karyotypic mosaicism.  The observed numerical variability, both at intra-individual & inter-individual levels, does not appear to have hampered the sustainability of the chromosomal diversity in each population under study.  Since the related D. indicum displays no such intra-individual or inter-individual variability whatsoever under identical experimental conditions, these results are unlikely to be artifacts.]",

    "abstract": "Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae are effective biocontrol agents against a number of important soil insect pests and are safe to vertebrates, plants and other non-target organisms with no negative effects on the environment. They are associated with mutualistic bacteria in the genus Xenorhabdus for Steinernematidae and Photorhabdus for Heterorhabditidae and are often referred to as the nematode/bacterium complex. The natural habitat of EPNs is the soil where the third-stage infective juveniles (IJs), the only free-living stage, can infect an array of insect hosts. However, the survival of the IJs is affected by various abiotic (i.e., temperature, moisture, soil texture, soil salinity, UV light, oxygen, and pH) and biotic (i.e., natural enemies, omnivores, scavengers, competitors, and plants) factors in the soil. In this review, we summarize the impact of the biotic factors, especially natural enemies, omnivores, scavengers, and competitors against EPNs and conclude that the major predators of the IJs appear to be nematophagous fungi, mites, and collembolans. Omnivores and scavengers, particularly, mites, collembolans, ants and birds, feeding on EPN-killed insects appear to be the major mortality factors on the developing nematodes especially of insects that are 2 days or less post infection. In addition, we discuss the defense mechanisms of EPN IJs against nematophagous fungi, and the protection of the nematode-killed insects by production of the scavenger deterrent factor produced by the mutualistic bacteria against omnivores and scavengers. By understanding the interactions between EPNs and their antagonists we can improve and increase the successful use of EPNs in biological control programs.",

    "abstract": "Figs (Ficus spp., Moraceae) are considered a classic example of plants with fleshy fruits adapted for seed dispersal by vertebrates, usually mammals or birds. Partially covering the endocarp of each individual drupelet of F. microcarpa is a fleshy, discrete lipid-containing exocarp that suggests adaptation for seed dispersal by ants. This structure is highly attractive to ants. F. microcarpa drupelets from which the fleshy exocarp was experimentally removed were much less likely to be transported by ants than those with this structure intact. The exocarps retained their attractiveness to ants and were not visibly altered following passage of the entire fruit through the gut of a frugivorous bird, the Indian Hill Mynah (Gracula religiosa). Germination percentage was not significantly affected by gut passage or exocarp removal. These results suggest that F. microcarpa has a two-stage seed dispersal system, in which primary dispersal by vertebrates is followed by secondary dispersal by ants. Dispersal aided by ants may be of significance in the biology of this exotic hemiepiphyte in southern Florida, where it is naturalized and appears to be spreading.     *[Site one was located near a Solenopsis invicta nest in the crack of a cement sidewalk.  Drupelets were placed 2-8 cm from the nest.  Site 2 was located on a rock wall with no ant nest visible.

In this context, ant species are unique in that they not only have to relocate adults, but they must also move their brood while maintaining colony cohesion. We explored the colony relocation dynamics of the ponerine ant Diacamma indicum in its natural habitat. Irrespective of whether ants relocated from their original nest in their natural habitat or from a nestbox in an unfamiliar but natural habitat, colonies experienced fission and multiple fragmentations. However, this fission was transient, and the colonies eventually unified at a single site. The movement of the ants did not exhibit any directional preference, and the gamergate did not enjoy any special attention during the relocation process. Tandem running, a behaviour in which one ant leads a follower ant from one site to another, was used to relocate about 96% of the colony members, and 28% of the colony became tandem leaders on average. The evacuation phase was significantly shorter than the reunification phase, and this may be an adaptive response to a disturbance in the ant's dwelling. Unlike other ants, the leaders were sighted at most of the temporary sites and thus, in principle, had the opportunity to compare the conditions of alternative sites directly. Most leaders discovered the final site by following other leaders; leaders following leaders occurred throughout the relocation process and constituted 30% of the total tandem runs. In the context of these experiments, the colony relocation and reunification dynamics of ants in their natural habitat are discussed.",

Studies on honeybees and ants in their natural habitat indicate that scouts encounter multiple options that vary in their physical and biotic characteristics. 2. Architectural features, location, odour, and the presence of nest mates impact their choice of nest site selection. In order to examine the influence of diverse parameters on final nest site selection we conducted choice experiments on ants in the context of relocation. 3. After controlling for any influence by physical characteristics, we found that the presence of brood, adults, and colony odour acted as attractants with more colonies relocating into these new nests than expected by chance alone. In contrast, the presence of a reproductive female, or familiarity of location had no influence on the choice. New nests containing dead ants evoked cleaning responses from scouts, which may interfere with relocation into these nests. 4. Even although colonies consist of hundreds of adults and brood, colony integrity was maintained in 98.7% of colonies. Furthermore, we found that none of the eight studied colonies relocated when faced with minor flooding in their natural habitat, indicating that the cost of relocation is non-trivial and that this species is capable of minor damage repairs. 5. These observations highlight the complexity of relocation in general, allow the characterisation of desirable nest attributes in this species, and highlight the need for similar exploration in other social insects.",

    "abstract": "*[Efforts to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of ants have been boosted in the last few years by accumulation of comprehensive molecular data sets exploring multiple loci on a wide range of taxa within the family.  In contrast, the wealth of morphological information for the group remains scattered across the literature comprising more than a century's worth of taxonomic & anatomical research with little standardization.  The present study addresses this problem by providing a synthesis of the external skeletal morphology of ants with special emphasis on the poneromorph subfamilies (Amblyoponinae, Ectatomminae, Heteroponerinae, Paraponerinae, Ponerinae, & Proceratiinae).  Particular attention was devoted to documenting & standardizing morphological characters for phylogenetic inference.  The morphological analysis was undertaken by constructing a digital atlas of 28 standard views containing 5250 scanning electron micrographs documenting worker ant morphology from which detailed anatomical comparison could be accurately performed.  The final matrix describes 139 characters (60% of which are completely new or coded cladistically here for the first time) for 105 terminals representing, 90% of extant poneromorph genera plus all other extant formicid subfamilies, with the exception of the rare Martilinae, & nonformicid outgroups.  This matrix was analyzed with parsimony under both equal weights & implied weights (i.e., where characters are downweighted as a function of their homoplasy).  The poneromorph subfamilies form a paraphyletic assemblage with the dorylomorphs, leptanillomorphs, & myrmicomorphs nested inside.  All the above subfamilies are in turn reconstructed as nested within a paraphyletic group comprising the formicomophs + myrmeciomorphs.  These results are in concordance with traditional precladistic views of the subfamily relationships, but are markedly different from current estimates based on molecular data.]",

Worker ants exposed to B. bassiana died faster than ants exposed to either of 2 strains of M. anisopliae (Ma1 and Ma2). When the ants were allowed continuous access to fungal conidia in an inoculation chamber, B. bassiana killed the ants faster than ants exposed to either Ma1 or Ma2. When exposed once to fungal conidia, during a single feeding within an inoculation chamber (that is, direct exposure), the workers exposed to B. bassiana died quicker than did those exposed to either strain of M. anisopliae. To study the effects of horizontal transmission of conidia on pathogenicity, workers were directly exposed to B. bassiana and mixed with other unexposed workers (that is, indirect exposure). At a 1:1 ratio of exposed to unexposed workers, the ants died at a rate that did not differ significantly from that in the earlier, direct exposures, yet at a 1:9 ratio of exposed to unexposed workers, the rate of mortality was slower.

    "abstract": "A literature survey identified 403 primary research publications that investigated the ecological effects of invasive alien insects and/or the mechanisms underlying these effects. The majority of these studies were published in the last 8 years and nearly two-thirds were carried out in North America. These publications concerned 72 invasive insect species, of which two ant species, Solenopsis invicta and Linepithema humile, accounted for 18% and 14% of the studies, respectively. Most publications investigated effects on native biodiversity at population or community level. Genetic effects and, to a lesser extent, effects on ecosystem services and processes were rarely explored. We review the effects caused by different insect invaders according to: their ecosystem roles, i.e. herbivores, predators, parasites, parasitoids and pollinators; the level of biological organization at which they occur; and the direct and indirect mechanisms underlying these effects. The best documented effects occur in invasive ants, Eurasian forest herbivores invasive in North America, and honeybees. Impacts may occur through simple trophic interactions such as herbivory, predation or parasitism. Alien species may also affect native species and communities through more complex mechanisms such as competition for resources, disease transmission, apparent competition, or pollination disruption, among others. Finally, some invasive insects, particularly forest herbivores and ants, are known to affect ecosystem processes through cascading effects. We identify biases and gaps in our knowledge of ecological effects of invasive insects and suggest further opportunities for research.          *[S. wagneri has been supressed in favor of S. invicta.

Hence, the presence of heavy metals in coal mine soil is of concern to land managers. Insects occupy different trophic positions in the food chains, thus many insect species accumulate large amounts of heavy metals in their bodies and this is a matter of concern. In the present study, we investigated biotransfer and bioaccumulation of heavy metals from soil, grass species Cynodon dactylon, Vetiveria zizanioides, grasshopper species Gastrimargus africanus, Choroedocus robustus, ant species Cataglyphis longipedem and Camponotus compressus in six different ages (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 year old) of coal mine sites. Our study revealed that at some extent the heavy metal content and BAF patterns of heavy metals along different pathways (from soil to grass, soil to grasshoppers and from grass to grasshoppers) were not consistent and did not reflect the soil pollution status for all the metals, related to the mine spoil dump age. However, in contrast, ants successfully reflected a consistent pattern in the bioaccumulation of heavy metals via soil, thereby indicating the pollution status of the soil along with the restoration age of mine spoil dumps. Our study showed that ant species can successfully forecast the presence of heavy metals of coal mine spoils along with their restoration.",

    "abstract": "The present study focuses on the abundance, heavy metal content, and the impact of ecosystem engineering activities of two coal mine site-inhabiting ant species, Cataglyphis longipedem and Camponotus compressus. The abundance of Ct. longipedem increased while that of C. compressus decreased, with increasing soil pollution. Correspondence analysis reveals a close association between soil heavy metal concentrations and Ct. longipedem abundance, but this association is lacking in the case of C. compressus. Cataglyphis ants which occupy stress-characterized niches appear to be pre-adapted to tolerate heavy metal pollution. Higher concentrations of Zn and Mn in Ct. longipedem may contribute to the strengthening of the cuticular structures, necessary for nest excavation in the hard, arid soil and for single load carrying. C. compressus ants appear to be pollution sensitive. Their higher Fe content may be related to metal uptake via plant-derived liquids and species-specific regulatory mechanisms. The metal pollution index and biota-to-soil accumulation factors, calculated by using the ant body metal content of the two species, indicate an overall decrease of soil heavy metal concentrations with increase of the site age, which reflects the degree of pollution related to the mine site age. The concentrations of total and available heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Pb, and Cu) were significantly lower in the ant nest debris soil as compared to the reference soil. The results of the present study highlight the role of ants as bioindicators and in bioremediation of contaminated soil.",

During this study, 28 species of ants representing 6 subfamilies (Aenictinae, Dolichoderinae, Formicinae, Myrmicinae, Ponerinae, Pseudomyrmecinae) were recorded.  The highest diversity was exhibited by the subfamily Myrmicinae with 11 ant species represented by 7 genera.  The ants belonging to Crematogaster spp. exhibited the highest diversity, represented by 4 species.  This was followed by Formicinae with a 28% contribution & represented by 6 genera & 8 species including the invasive ants, Black crazy ants, Red Fire Ants, & Yellow crazy ants.  Ten ant species were commonly observed at Maharashtra Nature Park, 4 species of Myrmicinae, 4of Formicinae, & one each from Dolichoderinae & Pseudomyrmicinae.  The common occurrence of Tetraponera rufonigra (Pseudomyrmecinae), an arboreal species, at Maharashtra Nature Park indicated availability of suitable trees providing microhabitats for the species at this site.  Two species of Diacamma & 2 species of Leptogenys (Ponerinae) were occasionally recorded at Maharashtra Nature Park.

    "abstract": "This is the first compilation of our research and data from the literature on the duration and thermal reaction norms for development in ants. Altogether, 97 regression lines characterizing the linear dependence of ant brood (egg, larval, prepupal and pupal) development on temperature were obtained for 33 species from 15 genera and three subfamilies. Significant positive correlations between the durations of different immature stages were revealed. We found differences between thermal reaction norms for development for various immature stages, some taxonomic groups, and southern and northern groups of species. All immature stages appeared to be shorter on average at 25 degrees-C in northern ants compared to southern species; this difference is insignificant only for eggs. Highly significant negative correlations were revealed between the temperature threshold for development (TTD) and the sum of degree-days (SDD) for all immature stages. The latitudinal trends in intraspecific variation of thermal constants appeared to be opposite to those we observed at the interspecific level. At the latter, the coefficient of thermal sensitivity of development (i.e. the coefficient of linear regression of development rate on temperature) and TTD tends to decrease and SDD to increase from the south to the north. In contrast, at the intraspecific level, development became more temperature-sensitive in northern populations, i.e. characterized by higher slopes of regression lines of development rate on temperature, and higher TTDs. The species of the genus Formica are characterized by the shortest and the most temperature-sensitive immature development among all the ant species studied.",

Berghoffia represents the first record of the tribe Dorylogstrini outside of Africa.  The 3 new species above are all associated with Dorylus (Dichthadia) laevigatus in Perak, Malaysia as are other new species here listed.  These are Doryloxenus coecus n.sp.  Zyras (Rhychodonia) praedabunda n.sp. & Trachydonia dichthadiaphila n.sp.  Micropolemon subahensis n.sp. was collected from palm oil baits in Poring Hot Springs, Sabah associated with the same ant species.  Additionally both Doryloxenus groveri & Micropolemon malayensis were collected associated with the same host.  These species had been previously described from specimens associated with termites, most likely left behind after raids of the ants had subsided.  A revised phylogeny of the Pygostenini is presented which incorporates the 2 new pygostenine genera.  The behavior of most of the species is described.  The range of behavior is from predation [Zyras (Rhynchodonia), and Trachydonia] to close association (all of the Pygostenini).  Within the Pygostenini, the limuloid genera (Doryoxenus, Pseudolydorus, & Pygosplanus) seem to be more closely integrated into the ant colony than the more elongate species (Micropolemon).  The progenitors of all the Pygostenini is in Africa where the more primitive genera are found with the more epigean species of doryline ants.  The subgenus Zyras (Rhynchodonia) is presently known only from the Indomalayan zoogeographic region, but since the majority of the known species of Zyras (s. lat.) are from Africa, it is likely that the ancestral link will ultimately be with some of the larger bodied African Zyras.  Trachydonia has far more species in Africa than in the Orient so the few species in Malaysia & Indonesia may be the result of invasion after the movement of the Indian subcontinent onto the rest of Asia.]",

    "abstract": "Variation in community composition over a species' geographic range leads to divergent selection pressures, resulting in interpopulation variation in trait expression. One of the most pervasive selective forces stems from antagonists such as parasites. Whereas hosts of microparasites developed sophisticated immune systems, social parasites select for behavioural host defences. Here, we investigated the link between parasite pressure exerted by the socially parasitic slavemaking ant Protomognathus americanus and colony-level aggression in Temnothorax ants from 17 populations. We studied almost the entire geographic range of two host species, including unparasitized populations. As previous studies have demonstrated that host colonies responding highly aggressively towards conspecifics fare better during slavemaker attacks, we predicted higher aggression levels in severely parasitized populations. Indeed, we demonstrate an increase in aggression towards conspecifics with parasite pressure, a pattern that was consistent over the two host species. In contrast to other studies, aggression against the parasite itself did not shift with parasite pressure. This may be explained by an absence of costs of parasite-specific aggression in parasite-free populations. The preferred host species T. longispinosus was generally more aggressive; however, the association between parasite pressure and aggression was found for both species, suggesting convergent co-adaptation. Two potentially confounding factors, colony density and the co-occurrence of a competing Temnothorax species in the community, could not explain the level of colony aggression in intra- and interspecific interactions. Instead, our study points to social parasite pressure as the determining factor shaping antagonistic interactions within, but not between, host species.",

    "abstract": "Many tropical insect species remain formally undescribed, and the validity of some rarely collected and poorly studied taxa is uncertain. Overbeckia Viehmeyer, 1916 is a monotypic ant genus and a rare member of the arboreal ant communities of tropical South East Asia and Australasia. Overbeckia subclavata Viehmeyer, 1916 was collected and described from Singapore more than a century ago and there have been few other records of these ants since. Here we compare the existing Overbeckia records with recent collections in Australia, New Guinea and Indonesia. We revise the taxonomic diagnosis of the genus Overbeckia in comparison with other genera of the diverse tribe Camponotini, redescribe O. subclavata and describe two new species, Overbeckia papuana sp. nov., and Overbeckia jambiensis, sp. nov. We also summarise all available ecological and distributional information of the genus, indicating that Overbeckia occurs in a variety of lowland vegetation types, from rainforests to secondary growth and plantations but is extremely rare. Using external morphological characters, internal proventricular structures and a molecular phylogeny of 78 Camponotini species based on five protein-coding loci, we demonstrate that Overbeckia is a monophyletic lineage. Molecular-clock calibrated trees using 21 fossil records indicate that the divergence between Overbeckia and its sister clade comprising the genera Echinopla Smith, 1857 and Calomyrmex Emery, 1895 occurred c. 21Ma (95% highest posterior density 14-28), and that the divergence between the three Overbeckia species likely occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene. In addition, we transfer one Camponotus Mayr, 1861 species to Colobopsis in the light of molecular evidence: Colobopsis triangulata (Klimes & McArthur, 2014) comb. nov. Our analysis represents the most comprehensive phylogeny of the tribe Camponotini in terms of coverage of extant divergent lineages, including Overbeckia , and suggests relatively robust phylogenetic relationships among genera that are consistent with published phylogenomic trees. Overall, our study reveals cryptic species diversity in Overbeckia and provides strong evidence that this is a valid and polytypic ant genus.",

Under illumination from moonlight or artificial light, workers rely upon these beacons to mediate phototactic orientation.  In the absence of moonlight or artificial lights, ants were able to orient visually to terrestrial landmarks.  In the absence of all landmarks, save for overhanging tree branches, ants could negotiate shortcuts or make directional changes in response to visual landmarks presented within the tree canopy on a moonless night.  When experimental manipulations place the ants in total darkness, they could no longer negotiate shortcuts and would resort to thigmotactic orientation along structural guidelines to reach a food source.  The hierarchical oraganization of these diverse cues in a foraging strategy is discussed, as well as their adaptive significance to C. pennsylvanicus.  (abstract provided by author)",

    "abstract": "The oral toxicity of the delayed-action insecticide hydramethylnon, in contrast to the acute toxins chlordane and imidacloprid, was evaluated in free-foraging workers of the black carpenter ant, Camponotus pennsylvanicus (Degeer), gathering insecticide-laced, sugar-milk baits. Hydramethylnon was slower acting than either chlordane or imidacloprid. When workers fed upon 500-ppm baits, hydramethylnon killed ants significantly more slowly (LT50 [95% CL] = 12.7 [12.5-12.9] d) than did chlordane (1.3 [1.1-1.4] d) or imidacloprid (0.3 [0.1-0.5] d). All toxicants were transferred via trophallaxis (i.e., indirect exposure). In ants exposed to a single forager that fed upon a 500-ppm bait (i.e., the donor ant), hydramethylnon caused death significantly more slowly (LT50 [95% CL] = 12.2 [11.9-12.4] d) than did chlordane (4.1 [3.8-4.4] d) or imidacloprid (0.9 [0.8-1.0] d). In both direct and indirect exposures, significant concentration-dependent time delays before mortality were observed with each toxin. Donor ants in indirect exposures survived after gathering and transferring sugar-milk bait laced with chlordane or hydramethylnon but did not survive their exposure to imidacloprid. On the basis of these and other analyses, we identify delayed-action toxins suitable for carpenter ant baits.",

    "abstract": "One of the main aspects associated with the diversity in animal colour is the variation in melanization levels. In ectotherms, melanism can be advantageous in aiding thermoregulation through heat absorption. Darker bodies may also serve as a shield from harmful UV-B radiation. Melanism may also confer protection against parasites and predators through improving immunity responses and camouflage in regions with high precipitation, with complex and shaded vegetations and greater diversity of pathogens and parasites. We studied melanism evolution in the globally distributed ant genus Pheidole under the pressures of temperature, UV-B radiation and precipitation, while considering the effects of body size and nest habit, traits that are commonly overlooked. More importantly, we account for worker caste polymorphism, which is marked by distinct roles and behaviours. We revealed for the first time distinct evolutionary trajectories for each worker subcaste. As expected, major workers from species inhabiting locations with lower temperatures and higher precipitation tend to be more melanised. Curiously, we show a slight trend where minor workers of larger species also tend to have darker bodies when inhabiting regions with higher precipitation. Lastly, we did not find evidence for the effects of UV-B radiation and nest habit in the lightness variation of workers. Our paper explores the evolution of ant melanization considering a marked ant worker polymorphism and a wide range of ecological factors. We discuss our findings under the light of the Thermal Melanism Hypothesis, the Photoprotection Hypothesis and the Gloger\u0019s Rule.",

    "abstract": "Nests play an important role in the lives of organisms that occupy them and a suitable nesting site has to be selected carefully. Sometimes, a nest of better quality may be available near the current shelter and it may become advantageous to relocate into it rather than occupying a sub-optimal nest. Thus, organisms have to move for the sole purpose of improving their nest. We asked whether colonies of the Indian queenless ant, Diacamma indicum, would relocate if a better quality nest was available. We examined the response of the colonies and individual ants when relocating to improve their nests as compared to relocations from completely deteriorated nests when the deterioration was brought about rapidly. Colonies relocated to improve their nest quality as in all cases, low quality nests were abandoned in favour of nests of better quality. The condition of the old nest did not affect the temporal dynamics of relocation. In addition, the degree of deterioration of the old nest affected neither the decision-making process nor the organization of work in the colony during relocation contrary to what has been documented in other species of ants. Thus, the manner in which the colonies move to improve their nests is comparable to the dynamics of relocation when the old nest is totally destroyed. Although relocation is a costly event in terms of energy expenditure and the risks involved, colonies relocate to improve their nest as the costs of occupying a sub-optimal nest presumably outweigh the costs associated with relocation.",

Recently, Myrmecophilus albicinctus was synonymized with Myrmecophilus americanus regardless of the apparent host use difference. To clarify taxonomical relationship between Myrmecophilus albicinctus and Myrmecophilus albicinctus, we reexamined morphological characteristics of both species mainly in the viewpoint of anatomy. Observation of genitalia parts, together with a few external body parts, revealed that Myrmecophilus albicinctus showed different tendency from them of Myrmecophilus americanus.

Study sites comprised agricultural ecosystems, which included fields of cotton, castor, tobacco & some vegetable crops, & urban ecosystems, which included the community gardens of Vadodara.  Pitfall traps & hand collection methods were used for collecting ants.  Twenty-two ant species from 13 genera, in 5 subfamilies were collected.  Ants of 15 species in 9 genera were found in urban ecosystems, & 16 species in 10 genera in agricultural ecosystems.  Rarefaction curves indicated these totals to be complete for the detectable ant fauna.  Pheidole showed greatest species richness in urban ecosystems, whereas Camponotus & Pheidole were equally speciose in the agricultural ecosystems.

    "abstract": "In view of the ongoing rarity of Ecbolium ligustrinum there is an urgent need for conservation of the species. For this, a detailed work was carried out regarding the untold story of its reproductive ecology. The work was done for three consecutive years (2015\u00132017) at Midnapore, West Bengal over three different populations collected from three different areas of West Bengal. Field data were also recorded from these three wild populations. The species produces gullet flowers with bi-labiate corolla having long slender tubes. The flowers exhibit one day of longevity. The flowers are visited by 10 species of insects. Among those, four species viz. Eristalis tenax, a Dipteran member and three ant species of Hymenoptera such as Camponotus sp., Formica sp. and Monomorium sp. are the effective pollinators. As per pollination efficiency, Eristalis tenax (PE i = 0.76) is the most successful one. The flowers are shortly protandrous (dichogamous) and passed by three distinct reproductive (male, bisexual and female) phases. The breeding system clearly depicts that the species is facultatively xenogamous supported by myophilous mode of pollination. However, geitonogamous type of pollination is also observed through myrmecophily, an atypical instance found in plants. Lastly, the plant retained some sort of autogamy through \u0018fail-safe\u0019 mechanism of pollination, an adaptation which might be developed in absence of pollinators. Therefore, undoubtedly it can be concluded that E. ligustrinum is a partially self-incompatible (ISI = 0.27) species having a mixed mating system, adapted for xenogamy through specialised mode of plant-pollinator interactions.           *[NOTE: These identifications need to be checked.  The picture labeled Formica (Fig. 2, h) is clearly a Camponotus.]",

So far ant pollination has been reported largely in herbaceous species, growing in warm and dry habitats. While studying pollination ecology of Syzygium species (Myrtaceae), growing in tropical forests of the Western Ghats, India, we observed one of the ant species, Technomyrmex albipes, to be the dominant floral visitor in S. occidentale (Bourd.) Chithra among a range of other insect (species of Xylocopa and Trigona, and Apis cerana) and bird visitors. We studied the role of ant species in pollination when compared to other floral visitors. The fruit set in flowers exclusively visited by T. albipes was significantly higher than those visited by any other visitor. The day and night exclusive pollination experiments allowing only T. albipes indicated diel pollination by T. albipes, which was the only active flower visitor during the night. The breeding system of the species was studied through controlled pollinations. The species is partially self-compatible and exhibits considerable autogamy.",

    "abstract": "When invasive species establish in new environments, they may disrupt existing or create new interactions with resident species. Understanding of the functioning of invaded ecosystems will benefit from careful investigation of resulting species-level interactions. We manipulated ant visitation to compare how invasive ant mutualisms affect two common plants, one native and one invasive, on a sub-tropical Indian Ocean island. Technomyrmex albipes, an introduced species, was the most common and abundant ant visitor to the plants. T. albipes were attracted to extrafloral nectaries on the invasive tree (Leucaena leucocephala) and deterred the plant's primary herbivore, the Leucaena psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana). Ant exclusion from L. leucocephala resulted in decreased plant growth and seed production by 22% and 35%, respectively. In contrast, on the native shrub (Scaevola taccada), T. albipes frequently tended sap-sucking hemipterans, and ant exclusion resulted in 30% and 23% increases in growth and fruit production, respectively. Stable isotope analysis confirmed the more predacious and herbivorous diets of T. albipes on the invasive and native plants, respectively. Thus the ants' interactions protect the invasive plant from its main herbivore while also exacerbating the effects of herbivores on the native plant. Ultimately, the negative effects on the native plant and positive effects on the invasive plant may work in concert to facilitate invasion by the invasive plant. Our findings underscore the importance of investigating facilitative interactions in a community context and the multiple and diverse interactions shaping novel ecosystems.",

Lack of research on this topic prevented accurate diagnosis and proper follow-up treatments to patients suffering from insect-induced allergies. The aim of our study was to identify the allergy-causing insects and evaluate resulting sensitization among a study population in West Bengal, India. The skin prick test (SPT) evaluated sensitivity of 450 patients who sought treatment at the Allergy and Asthma Research Center from July 2017 to June 2018. Eight insect allergens were tested: Common Black Ant (Lasius niger, Linnaeus 1758), Fire Ant (Solenopsis invicta, Buren 1972), Honey Bee (Apis cerana indica, Fabricius 1798), Common Wasp (Vespula vulgaris, Linnaeus 1758), Mosquito (Aedes aegypti, Linnaeus in Hasselquist 1762), American Cockroach (Periplaneta americana, Linnaeus 1758), House Fly (Musca domestica, Linnaeus 1758), and Grasshopper (Gesonula punctifrons, Stal 1861). From a total of 450 patients evaluated, 370 patients had positive SPT reaction from at least one of the 8 insect allergens tested. Sensitivity to some Hymenoptera insects (common black ant, 87.62%; fire ant, 84.59%; and honey bee, 67.02%) was found in higher proportion than non-Hymenoptera group (mosquito, 66.67%; American cockroach, 33.33%; house fly, 10.41%; and grasshopper, 5.14%). There was significant difference in sensitivity among child, adolescent, and adult (P < 0.001). While female patients showed more sensitivity than males to SPT, the difference was statistically insignificant. In regards to occupation, farmers and bee keepers were most sensitive of field workers sensitive to Hymenoptera-derived allergens.          *[This study revealed the co-existence of sensitization (45% of total) against the Hymenoptera insects possibly due to the presence of the 2 members of the Formicidae family.]          *[Solenopsis invicta is not reported from West Bengal (Antwiki 18Dec21).

    "abstract": "We investigated the phylogeny and taxonomy of the Prenolepis genus-group, a clade of ants we define within the subfamily Formicinae comprising the genera Euprenolepis, Nylanderia, gen. rev., Paraparatrechina, gen. rev. & stat. nov.,  Paratrechina, Prenolepis and Pseudolasius. We inferred a phylogeny of the Prenolepis genus-group using DNA sequence data from five genes (CAD, EF1±F1, EF1±F2, wingless and COI) sampled from 50 taxa. Based on the results of this phylogeny the taxonomy of the Prenolepis genus-group was re-examined. Paratrechina (broad sense) species segregated into three distinct, robust clades. Paratrechina longicornis represents a distinct lineage, a result consistent with morphological evidence; because this is the type species for the genus, Paratrechina is redefined as a monotypic genus. Two formerly synonymized subgenera, Nylanderia and Paraparatrechina, are raised to generic status in order to provide names for the other two clades. The majority of taxa formerly placed in Paratrechina, 133 species and subspecies, are transferred to Nylanderia, and 28 species and subspecies are transferred to Paraparatrechina. In addition, two species are transferred from Pseudolasius to Paraparatrechina and one species of Pseudolasius is transferred to Nylanderia. A morphological diagnosis for the worker caste of all six genera is provided, with a discussion of the morphological characters used to define each genus. Two genera, Prenolepis and Pseudolasius, were not recovered as monophyletic by the molecular data, and the implications of this result are discussed. A worker-based key to the genera of the Prenolepis genus-group is provided.

    "abstract": "AIM: Macroinvertebrates comprise a highly diverse set of taxa with great potential as indicators of soil quality. Communities were sampled at 3,694 sites distributed world\u0010wide. We aimed to analyse the patterns of abundance, composition and network characteristics and their relationships to latitude, mean annual temperature and rainfall, land cover, soil texture and agricultural practices. LOCATION: Sites are distributed in 41 countries, ranging from 55∞ S to 57∞ N latitude, from 0 to 4,000 m in elevation, with annual rainfall ranging from 500 to >3,000 mm and mean temperatures of 5-32∞C. TIME PERIOD: 1980-2018. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: All soil macroinvertebrates: Haplotaxida; Coleoptera; Formicidae; Arachnida; Chilopoda; Diplopoda; Diptera; Isoptera; Isopoda; Homoptera; Hemiptera; Gastropoda; Blattaria; Orthoptera; Lepidoptera; Dermaptera; and 'others'. METHODS: Standard ISO 23611\u00105 sampling protocol was applied at all sites. Data treatment used a set of multivariate analyses, principal components analysis (PCA) on macrofauna data transformed by Hellinger\u0019s method, multiple correspondence analysis for environmental data (latitude, elevation, temperature and average annual rainfall, type of vegetation cover) transformed into discrete classes, coinertia analysis to compare these two data sets, and bias\u0010corrected and accelerated bootstrap tests to evaluate the part of the variance of the macrofauna data attributable to each of the environmental factors. Network analysis was performed. Each pairwise association of taxonomic units was tested against a null model considering local and regional scales, in order to avoid spurious correlations. RESULTS: Communities were separated into five clusters reflecting their densities and taxonomic richness. They were significantly influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture and vegetation cover. Abundance and diversity, highest in tropical forests (1,895 ± 234 individuals/m≤) and savannahs (1,796 ± 72 individuals/m≤), progressively decreased in tropical cropping systems (tree\u0010associated crops, 1,358 ± 120 individuals/m≤; pastures, 1,178 ± 154 individuals/m≤; and annual crops, 867 ± 62 individuals/m≤), temperate grasslands (529 ± 60 individuals/m≤), forests (232 ± 20 individuals/m≤) and annual crops (231 ± 24 individuals/m≤) and temperate dry forests and shrubs (195 ± 11 individuals/m≤). Agricultural management decreased overall abundance by d54% in tropical areas and 64% in temperate areas. Connectivity varied with taxa, with dominant positive connections in litter transformers and negative connections with ecosystem engineers and Arachnida. Connectivity and modularity were higher in communities with low abundance and taxonomic richness. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Soil macroinvertebrate communities respond to climatic, soil and land\u0010cover conditions. All taxa, except termites, are found everywhere, and communities from the five clusters cover a wide range of geographical and environmental conditions. Agricultural practices significantly decrease abundance, although the presence of tree components alleviates this effect.",

    "abstract": "Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is an important crop cultivated in India and other warmer regions of the world. The crop is dependent on insect pollinators for its fruit set. However, information about pollination ecology in Indian states remains undetermined. We used a replicated field-scale experiment to identify the native pollinators and their foraging behaviour, including abundance, visitation rate, duration of visit, and pollination efficiency. We compared treatments with open-pollinated, hand-pollinated and the addition of two managed pollinator species to estimate the yield enhancement potential of managed stingless bees and western honey bees and their impact on native pollinator species. We found that ants, bees, butterflies, beetles, and wasps visited the flowers either for nectar, pollen, and/or floral tissue. Regarding the \u0018pollinator importance\u0019 value of the visitors, Halictus acrocephalus and Lasioglossum funebre were the most effective native pollinators. Despite their contribution, the plants showed a significant pollination deficit in the open-pollinated system which can be overcome by supplementary pollination services through the management of western honey bees (Apis mellifera) and/or stingless bees (Tetragonula iridipennis). However, the application of A. mellifera colonies greatly reduces the abundance, visitation rate and foraging time (amount of time spent per visit on a flower) of native pollinators. Hence, the utilization of managed stingless bee colonies for pollination services is more suitable and has a lesser impact on native pollinator species, which may lead to sustainable agricultural practices.",

However, potential intracolonial conflicts may not actually be realized so that resource allocation could be shaped primarily by among-colony selection that maximizes colony productivity. To elucidate the causal basis of patterns of resource allocation, I experimentally manipulated three fundamental aspects of colony social structure (among workers, relatedness among larvae, and queen presence) in the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus and measured effects on colony resource allocation to new workers, gynes, and males. The experimental manipulations had widespread effects on patterns of colony resource allocation, but there was little evidence for realized conflicts over the sex ratio and caste ratio. Decreasing nestmate relatedness caused decreased colony productivity, suggesting that more closely related nestmates have more favorably interacting phenotypes. Together, these results suggest that resource allocation in T. curvispinosus may be shaped more by among-colony selection than intracolonial conflict, leading to queen-worker-brood coadaptation.",

    "abstract": "The study examined the diversity and density of ant species of Carmel College campus, Nuvem, Salcete Goa, as there was no adequate information relating to ant faunal diversity of this region, from July 2006 to April 2007. The ants were collected using various standard methods. The result showed that a total of 9202 individuals were collected from the study area. The sampled specimens represented 37 species belonging to 20 genera and six subfamilies. The most diverse subfamily in relation to species was Myrmicinae with 12 species, followed by subfamily Formicinae with eleven, Ponerinae with seven and Pseudomyrmicinae with four species. Less diversity was found in subfamily Dorylinae with just two species and Dolichoderinae with only one species. In the generic trend, eight genera were in subfamily Myrmicinae while five in Formicinae, four in Ponerinae and just one genus each in Dolichoderinae, Dorylinae and Pseudomyrmicinae. This study has yielded valuable information of ant diversity in this region as well as on the campus of Carmel College of Arts, Science and Commerce for Women. An effort was made to compare the findings of this study with that of a similar study conducted almost ten years later (2015\u00132016) in the same study area. The results showed a remarkable difference with four subfamilies, 13 genera and 17 species.",

    "abstract": "Studies on many species have suggested that animals across the taxa remain behaviourally motionless for a significant part of their active phase. It is true of social insects such as ants, which constitute a considerable portion of insect biomass. It is hypothesized that behavioral quiescence ensures the conservation of energy. In many ecologically demanding situations, organisms lose a significant part of their rest. Many animals become more active before and during mating to defend territories, compete with rivals, engage in the nuptial flight and prepare to take care of the brood and raise the first batch of workers. Although we know mating changes activity in ants, there is negligible information on how mating affects the amount of rest. Here, I report that the queens of the carpenter ant Camponotus compressus lose a significant amount of rest immediately after mating, and this change can be seen up to 1-year post-mating. Before mating, males and females are active simultaneously, which may be critical for their nuptial flight. The total rest of the unmated queens is less than males during the day and night. After mating, mated queens lose a significant amount of rest. I was interested in observing whether these changes are transient and are restricted to a small window after mating, so I housed ant queens (unmated and mated) in the lab for a year. After 1 year, mated queens exhibit a lower amount of rest than unmated queens of the same age and freshly mated queens. These results suggest ants forgo their rest to adapt to the new phase of life after mating, which involves immediate searching of nest sites, building nests and raising offspring.",

    "abstract": "A virgin ant queen has only one opportunity in her lifetime to realize her reproductive fitness when she leaves her nest for a mating flight. After successful mating she sheds her wings, excavates a nest and starts laying eggs to initiate her own colony. Here we report the results of our study on two related species of Camponotus ants - day active Camponotus paria and night active Camponotus compressus - aimed at investigating (i) if there exist inter-species differences in the activity and phototactic behaviors of males and queens, (ii) whether these behaviors in the queen change after mating, and (iii) whether the activity rhythm of queens changes with age. We find that while activity profiles differ between C. paria and C. compressus virgin males and queens, such differences in queens disappear after mating. Once mated, the activity rhythm of queens shows little change with age; the rhythm in virgin queens, on the other hand, changes considerably. As virgins, C. paria queens are positively phototactic, while C. compressus queens are negatively phototactic. After mating, C. paria queens become less phototactic, particularly during the subjective night, while C. compressus queens remain negatively phototactic. These results indicate that there are considerable differences in the activity and phototactic behaviors of virgin queens of the two related species of Camponotus ants. Most of these differences disappear after mating, which suggests that these behaviors may have evolved primarily for the proper execution of pre-mating events.",

Here we report the results of our study aimed at investigating the effect of the interaction between circadian timing system and environmental light/dark (LD) cycles on pre-adult development time of two sympatric species of Camponotus ants, the night active Camponotus compressus, and the day active C. paria - both species develop in dark underground nests, under fairly constant conditions of humidity and temperature. We estimated pre-adult developmental durations in these ants under three different LD cycles (T20 = 10 h of light and 10 h of darkness, T24 = 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness, and T28 = 14 h of light and 14 h of darkness). We find that both species exhibit significantly faster pre-adult development under T24 compared to T20 and T28. Given that faster development in insects is considered as an adaptive strategy these results can be taken to suggest that Camponotus ants accrue greater fitness advantage under T24 compared to T20 and T28 LD cycles, possibly due to \"circadian resonance\" between circadian timing system and environmental LD cycle. Thus our study reveals that boreal species of ants could serve as a case for the study of adaptive significance of circadian organization.",

This day/night-length-mediated difference in pre-adult developmental duration was mostly due to modulation of larval duration; however, in day-active species it was also via altered pupal duration.

    "abstract": "Granivorous animals that cache as well as consume seeds may actually serve as mutualists to their plant resources. Seeds of Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), a perennial bunchgrass in North American deserts, are consumed by various desert granivores and dispersed by seed-caching heteromyid rodents. We used a three-way factorial design at a western Nevada site to selectively exclude or allow access to experimental plots by granivorous rodents and seed harvester ants, and to subsequently follow the fate of radiolabeled Indian ricegrass seeds introduced to the plots. In addition to the presence or absence of rodents or ants, the third experimental treatment factor was to allow 'initial caching' of the radiolabeled seeds by single Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami), which were confined to certain plots for one night. Both rodents and ants larder-hoarded seeds in their burrows, but seedlings rarely established from larders. Only rodents also placed seeds in scatterhoards: shallowly buried surface caches distributed about an animal's home range. Following initial caching by a kangaroo rat, the number of seedlings established from scatterhoards was significantly greater (usually by more than an order of magnitude) than those from seeds unharvested by either type of granivore. With no initial caching, rodents reduced seedling recruitment from unharvested seeds but facilitated compensatory seedling recruitment from scatterhoards. Seeds harvested by ants seldom established seedlings. We used a seed fate model to estimate that, on average, rodents and ants harvested 96% and 7%, respectively, of seeds to which they had exclusive access, and that the probability of seedling establishment for a seed harvested by a rodent was an order of magnitude greater than from a seed harvested by an ant and slightly greater than for an unharvested seed. The predicted rank order of seedling recruitment among nine experimental treatments based on expected effects of rodent seed caching closely matched the observed ranking pattern, indicating that rodents determined seedling recruitment patterns of Indian ricegrass. Because rodents harvested such a large majority of seeds and their caches enhanced seedling establishment, they played a central role in the population dynamics of Indian ricegrass.

    "abstract": "The endemic biota of the Hawaiian archipelago, the most isolated island group on Earth, is well known to be highly vulnerable to invasions by introduced species. Haleakala National Park is one of the more intact natural areas in the archipelago, yet its floristic and faunistic lists include about half introduced species. The following introduced species at Haleakala are believed to have significant effects on populations of native species and/or ecosystem processes: 15-20 vascular plant species, feral goats, feral pigs, small Indian mongoose, two rat species, house mouse, predacious ants, ground-nesting yellowjackets, various generalist tachinid flies and ichneumonid and braconid wasps that parasitize endemic lepidopterans, predatory snails, and avian malaria. Possible reasons for the high vulnerability of endemic island organisms and island ecosystems to invasion of and displacement by alien species include relative lack of evolutionary adaptation to disturbance, possession of life history strategies inappropriate when coexisting with anthropogenically introduced species, a \"disharmonic\" biota, presence of lower species numbers than occur in comparable continental systems, reduced competitive ability due to repeated founder events, and small population size with resultant genetic \"restrictive specialization.\" Current management at Haleakala emphasizes control of feral goats and pigs. The next priority is to control selected introduced plants as well as ants and yellow-jackets which appear potentially capable of eliminating essential pollinators. In spite of some serious losses of endemic biota, most of the park is still overwhelmingly dominated by native species. With active and enlightened management, the prognosis for preservation of most native ecosystem components seems to be favorable for the foreseeable future.

They do not show any developmental delays & all-year round the ontogenetic stages from egg to pupa exist in their nests.  Most temperate & all boreal climate ants are true heterodynamic.  They manifest a real winter diapause (prospective dormancy) in their annual cycle.  Thus, a variety of forms of dormancy, which were found in ants, extend from elementary quiescence to deep diapause.  Heterodynamic ants use 2 main seasonal strategies with respect to brood rearing: strategy of concentrated brood rearing (Formica type) & strategy of prolonged brood rearing (Aphaenogaster type, Myrmica type).  The larval stages at which diapause can occur are extremely variable among ants.  The evolution of seasonal life cycles & possible ways of origin of diapause in ants are discussed.

Three independent tests were conducted at some coffee plantations in SW Colombia with the purpose of answering the following questions: 1) Do ants nest in artificial substrates made from recyclable materials?  2) Do the types of substrate (materials & configuration) & coffee management (shade-grown vs. sun-grown coffee) affect colonization rates, richness, & identity of colonizing ants?  3) Does time affect substrate colonization rates?  Each experiment independently compared different substrate materials & designs, in both shade & sun-grown coffee.  Results showed preference of one of the substrates offered & higher nesting rates in shade-grown plantations.  Eight ant species were found nesting in artificial substrates, most of them being arboreal generalists.  A higher number of ant species colonized substrates in shade-grown plantations; however, the effect was not statistically significant.  Nesomyrmex asper & Crematogaster spp. were always found nesting in both types of plantation.  There was a trend to increase nesting activity with time in shade-grown coffee, but not in sun-grown coffee.]",

    "abstract": "Environmental conditions exert strong selection on animal behavior. We tested the hypothesis that the altered behavior of hosts due to parasitic manipulation is also subject to selection imposed by changes in environmental conditions over time. Our model system is ants manipulated by parasitic fungi to bite onto vegetation. We analyzed the correlation between forest type (tropical vs. temperate) and the substrate where the host bites (biting substrate: leaf vs. twigs), the time required for the fungi to reach reproductive maturity, and the phylogenetic relationship among specimens from tropical and temperate forests from different parts of the globe. We show that fungal development in temperate forests is longer than the period of time leaves are present and the ants are manipulated to bite twigs. When biting twigs, 90% of the dead ants we examined had their legs wrapped around twigs, which appears to provide better attachment to the plant. Ancestral state character reconstruction suggests that leaf biting is the ancestral trait and that twig biting is a convergent trait in temperate regions of the globe. These three lines of evidence suggest that changes in environmental conditions have shaped the manipulative behavior of the host by its parasite.

    "abstract": "*[To determine the extent to which odorous house ants, Tapinoma sessile, follow patterns of reduced conspecific aggression commonly found in other ant species with similar polygynous colony structures, a variety of behavioral assays were used to assess aggressive behavior between members of colonies from natural & urban environments.  For all 3 assays, urban polygynous colonies were in fact the most aggressive, in contrast to my predictions.  While the reasons for higher aggression in urban colonies are not clear, it is possible that the natural colonies of odorous house ants are simply too small to risk losses due to conflict.  The extremely large worker populations of urban supercolonies may allow different competitive strategies, that were previously impossible for T. sessile to utilize successfully.   Using a combination of methods from behavioral & chemical ecology, I compared workers that had been maintained in a lab over time to workers freshly collected from the field at a variety of time points.  In contrast with previous research, this study had the added strength of taking several observations in a series over time, rather than simply comparing an initial & final time point.  Contrary with those studies, I found no effect of lab maintenance on ant behavior.  Cuticular hydrocarbon profiles were significantly altered by laboratory maintenance, however, this effect was small when compared to the differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles between colonies.]",

    "abstract": "Adequate studies are available on the role of ants in insect pest management in general, but for a few particularly in cashew. This investigation examines the role of weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina in managing tea mosquito bug (Helopeltis spp.) - the numero uno cashew pest. The trial objective was to explore the feasibility of ants as bio-control agent in cashew. Critical monitoring of ant nest dynamics, bug-damage profile and resultant yield in the naturally ant-nests harbored trees (11-13 year old) was carried out in the cashew orchard. Trees with ant-nests, recorded significantly lower insect-damage. Nest-number fluctuation was discussed in details in terms of leaf-pavilion (single-leaf nest), green (active), dry (abandoned) nests over time (3 years). Amongst, mutualist trophobionts, scales were invariably present without any placebo effect. Based on this investigation, no spraying on cashew trees harbouring ant-nests is recommended. Positive role of red ants in reducing the Helopeltis damage clearly demonstrates its potential and promising utility in pest management intervention.          **[In table 2: Pseudomyrmecinae misspelled Pseudomyrmicinae; Solenopsis geminata incorrectly listed in Formicinae, it is a Myrmicinae.]",

Studying the allometry & non-allometry components of each caste system revealed a highly complex size & shape relationship in the female caste systems.  From the allometric & non-allometric analysis, we concluded that the major worker ants showed a closer relationship with the queen than the minor worker ant.

The current study aimed at investigating diet composition of the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) in an agro-ecosystem of Sialkot District using a faecal analysis method. Results revealed a diverse diet of the species, comprising both animal and plant matter. Animals were consumed more heavily (58%) than plants (8%). The predominant prey species were insects, while rodents, birds, seeds and plant leaves comprised a smaller portion of the diet. The insects prey species belonged to five different orders: Odonata (dragonflies), Orthoptera (grasshoppers and mole crickets), Coleoptra (ground beetles), Dermoptera (earwigs) and Hymenoptera (family Formicidae; ants). The consumption of insects was higher during the summer season. Mammalian prey included five different rodent species: Bendicota bengalensis (lesser bandicoot rat), Nesokia indica (short-tailed mole rat), Suncus murinus (Asian musk shrew), Tatera indica (Indian gerbil) and Mus musculus (house mouse). Prey species richness was higher in the summer as was the diversity index, while the evenness index showed slightly higher values in spring and autumn compared to summer and winter. We conclude that small mammals are important prey species of the mongoose while insects are eaten regularly and in reasonably large numbers in its native range.",

    "abstract": "tArthropod diversity is often linked to variation in resource use, dispersal ability, habitat connectivity, and climate factors that differ across spatial scales. The aim of this research was to examine how species richness, functional diversity, and community composition of two taxa differing in functional roles and dispersal ability are structured across spatial scales and to identify the importance of vegetation, climate, and landscape in explaining these patterns at different scales. Organisms were collected from tree canopies using insecticidal fogging in the summer of 2000 from 96 trees in 24 stands of 6 deciduous forest sites in 2 ecoregions of the eastern United States. Taxonomic and functional beta diversity of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and spiders (Araneae) were partitioned across four hierarchical spatial scales (individual tree, forest stand, site, and ecoregion). The contributions of climatic, landscape, and vegetation variables were determined using model selection. Ant and spider species richness, functional diversity, and community composition differed between taxa and across spatial scales. Alpha diversity (within trees) was lower than expected for both taxa and types of diversity, with host tree species supporting different species of ants and spiders. While the beta components of species diversity among trees and forest stands were greater than expected for both taxa, spiders also showed significant levels of beta diversity among sites. Functional beta diversity was less scale\u0010dependent than taxonomic beta diversity. Stand\u0010level patterns of beta diversity were significantly predicted by variation in climate and landscape connectivity. The effects of climate and landscape fragmentation on the diversity and community structure of both taxa indicate that anthropogenic climate change and land use change will alter canopy arthropod communities. Results also suggest that patterns of diversity among fragmentation metrics are influenced by differences in dispersal ability.          *[We collected 3053 individual ants representing 23 species, with 2 singleton species.  We collected 5221 individual spiders representing 23 families, 67 genera, & 97 species.  Of these, 83.7% were juveniles, we identified the remaining 925 adults to morphospecies, with 15 singleton species.]",

Lasius is one of the most abundant & widely distributed ant genera in the Holarctic region, with 95 described species placed in 6 subgenera: Acanthomyops, Austrolasius, Cautolasius, Chthonolasius, Dendrolasius; & Lasius.  The focus of this study was to use molecular phylogenetic analysis of 781 base pairs of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) & 251 base pairs of an anonymous nuclear gene (ANG) to address questions about the evolutionary relationships of North American Lasius species & subgenera.  These relationships were used to better understand the biological & evolutionary complexities associated with these species given their North American distributions.  The resulting hypotheses generated in this study from the analyses of these genes produced unexpected patterns of phylogenetic placement of Lasius species & subgenera.  A number of biological processes alone or together could explain these patterns, including interspecific hybridization & gene introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, & the presence of multiple cryptic species.]",

    "abstract": "This study concerns the ecological and economic features of a particular category of complementary foods in ethnic Peru -- comprising of insects, crustaceans, snails, and mushrooms -- grouped as chitin-bearing foods (CBFs). Data collection was through participatory methods and semistructured interviews with 242 individuals in eight communities/villages from four ethnic populations. We found that, in Peruvian Amazonian Amerindian communities, CBFs are the most relevant protein source during the rainy season. Shrimp (Macrobrachium sp.), crab (Hypolobocera peruviana), palmweevil (Rhynchophorus palmarum), leaf-cutter ants (Atta cephalotes), and Lepidoptera larvae are common in the Amazonian diet. In Awaj˙n and Ashaninka communities, most interviewed subjects declared significant consumption of CBFs, while a low percentage ate vertebrates every week during the rainy season and even in the dry season. In contrast, highland Quechua people occasionally consume larvae of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera and Quechua-Lamas populations (in the Amazonian region from historical times) consume the most accessible CBFs on a weekly basis. Traditional technologies and methods of semi-cultivation are evidence of a growing economic interest for CBFs. Relevant species have a high nutritional value in terms of chitin, fatty acids, and proteins, as well a high acceptance by the indigenous population. We conclude that Amazonian Amerindians manage these foods not only as a remedy for food shortage during the rainy season, but also as a stable forest resource and year-round agricultural by-product. We conclude that these traditional food practices should be incorporated within local and national agri-food policies to develop their economic potential and bring their social benefits into rural and peri-urban areas of Peru.",

We used redundancy analysis to test the effects of environmental factors (temperature, leaflitter volume, understory vegetation) and spatial predictors on species as well as functional group composition of communities at different elevations. Our results show that species diversity within all functional groups decreases towards higher elevations. The functional group composition of ant communities shows a gradient from high evenness at low elevations to being dominated by opportunist species at higher elevations. Redundancy analyses shows that most of the variation in species as well as functional group composition is driven by spatially structured environmental variation. This is most likely due to the high correlation between temperature and elevation. In summary, the changes in species as well as functional group composition are likely driven by a gradient in climate across the elevation gradient.",

    "abstract": "Expanding cities increasingly encroach fertile farmlands, questioning the viability of maintaining agriculture within and around them. Yet, our knowledge on how urbanization influences pollinator communities and the provision of pollination services to crops is limited, especially for the urbanization hotspots of the Global South. Mango Mangifera indica is one of the most important fruit crops in tropical countries. To analyse the dependency of mango on its main insect pollinators, and the direct and indirect effects of urbanization and insecticides on pollinator abundance and mango yield, we conducted a pollinator exclusion experiment and sampled flower visitors on 16 mango farms spread across rural\u0013urban landscapes in Bengaluru, a South Indian megacity. We found that allowing flowers access to ants and flying visitors (bees, hoverflies, nonsyrphid flies), dramatically increased mango yield by 350%, highlighting the importance of wild insects for mango pollination. We detected a trend between wild bee abundance and the final fruit set, with an increase of 20% when the number of bees increased from 25 to 125. Urbanization did not directly affect pollinator abundance or mango yield. However, the amount of insecticide applications had strong negative effects on wild bee abundance at low and intermediate levels of urbanization, while it had no effect in highly urbanized areas, presumably because of higher availability of flowering resources. Moreover, the amount of insecticides decreased the weight of harvested mango fruits by almost 30%. This may indicate trade\u0010offs between conventional pest control and enhanced crop yields through pollination by wild insects in rural areas. Synthesis and applications: Our results indicate that mango production can be maintained at a profitable level in urbanized landscapes with insect pollinators more than tripling final yield. However, increasing use of insecticides, besides raising farmers' expenses, can have negative effects on wild insect pollinators and mango yield, especially in rural areas. To safeguard crucial pollination services, it is therefore critical to conserve and promote wild insect pollinators by minimizing the negative effects of insecticide applications in these areas.          *[No specific ants mentioned.]",

This karyotype information corresponds to about 6% of described Formicidae species & has demonstrated that there is large variation among the known karyotypes.  For the artificial group called poneromorphs, information on chromosomes is available for all 6 poneromorph subfamilies.  The subfamily for which most karyotype information is available, the Ponerinae, is also the most diverse in species numbers.  Only within this family has the following been reported: karyotypes with chromosome numbers ranging from 2n=8 to 120; genera with stable karyotypes; chromosome patterns exclusive to a genus such as Dinoponera Roger, 1861; intraspecific variation in species of Neoponera Emery, 1901; & the presence of chromosomes with the potential for being a marker for the tribe Ponerini.  The hypotheses advanced in this chapter are based on the analysis of more than 100 karyotypes of poneromorphs.  We here discuss: 1) the state of the art of cytogenetics of Formicidae; 2) cytogenetics of poneromorphs; 3) case studies concerning the tribe Ponerini, with possible groupings of genera/karyotypes; 4) analysis of known karyotypes for this grouping using methods such as the karyograph; & 5) a comparison with other subfamilies.

    "abstract": "The impact of ash deposition levels on canopy arthropods was studied on the West Indian island of Montserrat, the site of an ongoing volcanic eruption since 1995. Many of the island's natural habitats have been buried by volcanic debris, and remaining forests regularly receive volcanic ash deposition. To test the effect of ash on canopy arthropods, four study sites were sampled over a 15-mo period. Arthropod samples were obtained using canopy fogging, and ash samples were taken from leaf surfaces. Volcanic ash has had a significant negative impact on canopy arthropod populations, but the decline is not shared equally by all taxa present, and total population variation is within the variance attributed to other abiotic and biotic factors. The affected populations do not differ greatly from those of the neighboring island of St. Kitts, which has not been subject to recent volcanic activity. This indicates that observed effects on Montserrat's arthropod fauna have a short-term acute response to recent ash deposition rather than a chronic depression caused by repeated exposure to ash over the last decade.          *[The Hymenoptera counts do not include the ants (Formicidae), which were so abundant that they were given their own category.  Examining relative abundance by taxon, ants constitute the largest single portion of the arthropod fauna at 31.13% of the total.   In each of the 34 Montserrat samples, the 3.75-mm to 5.0-mm size category was dominated by ants, which were the most abundant member of the canopy community (~30%) & were shown to be significantly affected by ash on Montserrat.  Ants do not exhibit a significant response to ash at levels <500 mg/m2, indicating ants might be resistant to smaller quantities of ash.]",

A low buzzing note was coming from the nests, and McGovern realized that they had arrived just in time for the swarming of these insects.  He was perplexed as to how the Indians had gauged their arrival so accurately, for almost at once thousands of the queens and drones began to take wing. The natives turned the baskets upside down over the various exits, and the ants flew into them and were caught.  All of the baskets were quickly filled, and the ant hunting expedition returned to camp jubilant.  .......The ants were not very large, but some ninety to a hundred of them made a very satisfactory meal, according to McGovern.  The Indians ate some of them raw, and others they roasted.  Of the raw ants they ate only the heads.  However, the whole bodies were eaten if they were roasted.  The Indians had large earthenware pans in which they roasted the insects over the fire.  McGovern, a true scientific spirit ever eager for new experiences, tried the ants both cooked and raw.  He found the uncooked heads too oily, but the roasted ants tasted to him like crisp bacon; and he could not understand why anyone should object to eating them.  These Indians considered ants a great delicacy\".]",

    "abstract": "The scale and nature of pre-Columbian human impacts in Amazonia are currently hotly debated. Whereas pre-Columbian people dramatically changed the distribution and abundance of species and habitats in some parts of Amazonia, their impact in other parts is less clear. Pioneer research asked whether their effects reached even further, changing how ecosystems function, but few in-depth studies have examined mechanisms underpinning the resilience of these modifications. Combining archeology, archeobotany, paleoecology, soil science, ecology, and aerial imagery, we show that pre-Columbian farmers of the Guianas coast constructed large raised-field complexes, growing on them crops including maize, manioc, and squash. Farmers created physical and biogeochemical heterogeneity in flat, marshy environments by constructing raised fields. When these fields were later abandoned, the mosaic of well-drained islands in the flooded matrix set in motion self-organizing processes driven by ecosystem engineers (ants, termites, earthworms, and woody plants) that occur preferentially on abandoned raised fields. Today, feedbacks generated by these ecosystem engineers maintain the human-initiated concentration of resources in these structures. Engineer organisms transport materials to abandoned raised fields and modify the structure and composition of their soils, reducing erodibility. The profound alteration of ecosystem functioning in these landscapes coconstructed by humans and nature has important implications for understanding Amazonian history and biodiversity. Furthermore, these landscapes show how sustainability of food-production systems can be enhanced by engineering into them fallows that maintain ecosystem services and biodiversity. Like anthropogenic dark earths in forested Amazonia, these self-organizing ecosystems illustrate the ecological complexity of the legacy of pre-Columbian land use.",

Ants clearly preferred 2 fern species, Nephrolepis cordifoliaa, a cultivated fern, & Diplazium expansum of presumably high water content.  Both species were of intermediate leaf thickness & specific leaf mass per area. As a consequence neither leaf thickness nor  leaf mass per area were correlated linearly with leaf consumption by ants.  Some ant colonies responded very differently to the same fern species, indicating that ant colonies may vary in their food demand & selection, perhaps depending on the number of larvae they have to care for.

    "abstract": "The most rapidly expanding habitat globally is the urban habitat, yet the origin and life histories of the populations of native species that inhabit this habitat remain poorly understood. We use DNA barcoding of the COI gene in the widespread native pest ant Tapinoma sessile to test two hypotheses regarding the origin of urban populations and traits associated with their success. First, we determine if urban samples of T. sessile have a single origin from natural populations by looking at patterns of haplotype clustering from across their range. Second, we examine whether polygynous colony structure - a trait associated with invasion success - is correlated with urban environments, by studying the lineage dependence of colony structure. Our phylogenetic analysis of 49 samples identified four well supported geographic clades. Within clades, Kimura-2 parameter pairwise genetic distances revealed <2.3% variation; however, between clade genetic distances were 7.5-10.0%, suggesting the possibility of the presence of cryptic species. Our results indicate that T. sessile has successfully colonized urban environments multiple times. Additionally, polygynous colony structure is a highly plastic trait across habitat, clade, and haplotype. In short, T. sessile has colonized urban habitats repeatedly and appears to do so using life history strategies already present in more natural populations. Whether similar results hold for other species found in urban habitats has scarcely begun to be considered.",

    "abstract": "Traditional healing methods involving hundreds of insect and other invertebrate species are reviewed. Some of the uses are based on the tenet of \u001csimilia similibus\u001d (let likes be cured by likes), but not all non-conventional health promoting practices should be dismissed as superstition or wishful thinking, for they have stood the test of time. Two questions are addressed: how can totally different organ systems in a human possibly benefit from extracts, potions, powders, secretions, ashes, etc. of a single species and how can different target organs, e.g. bronchi, lungs, the urinary bladder, kidneys, etc. apparently respond to a range of taxonomically not even closely related species? Even though therapeutically used invertebrates are generally small, they nevertheless possess organs for specific functions, e.g. digestion, gas exchange, reproduction. They have a nervous system, endocrine glands, a heart and muscle tissue and they contain a multitude of different molecules like metabolites, enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, secretions, etc. that have come under increased scientific scrutiny for pharmacological properties. Bearing that in mind it seems likely that a single species prepared and used in different ways could have a multitude of uses. But how, for example, can there be remedies for breathing and other problems, involving earthworms, molluscs, termites, beetles, cockroaches, bugs, and dragonflies? Since invertebrates themselves can suffer from infections and cancers, common defence reactions are likely to have evolved in all invertebrates, which is why it would be far more surprising to find that each species had evolved its own unique disease fighting system. To obtain a more comprehensive picture, however, we still need information on folk medicinal uses of insects and other invertebrates from a wider range of regions and ethnic groups, but this task is hampered by western-based medicines becoming increasingly dominant and traditional healers being unable and sometimes even unwilling to transmit their knowledge to the younger generation. However, collecting and uncontrolled uses of therapeutic invertebrates can put undue pressure on certain highly sought after species and this is something that has to be borne in mind as well.",

To investigate the evolution and biogeographic history of the group, we reconstructed their phylogeny and biogeography using molecular data from 209 taxa and seven genes. Our molecular data support the monophyly of Polyrhachis at the generic level and several of the 13 recognized subgenera, but not all are recovered as monophyletic. We found that Campomyrma Wheeler consists of two distinct clades that follow biogeographic affinities, that the boundaries of Hagiomyrma Wheeler are unclear depending on the analysis, that Myrma Billberg might be treated as one or two clades, and that Myrmhopla Forel is not monophyletic, as previously proposed. Our biogeographic ancestral range analyses suggest that the evolution of Polyrhachis originated in South\u0010East Asia, with an age of the modern crown\u0010group Polyrhachis of 58 Ma. Spiny ants dispersed out of South\u0010East Asia to Australia several times, but only once to mainland Africa around 26 Ma.",

However, the ecological nature of this association is not well understood, and the information on palm-ant interactions is primarily anecdotal. Here, we conducted a field study in the secondary forest of the Danum Valley Conservation Area, Malaysian Borneo, on 41 individuals of the rattan Korthalsia furtadoana. All studied plants showed signs of a past or present partnership with domatia-nesting ants, as indicated by entry holes in domatia. In 14 plants, our physical disturbance of a stem provoked the appearance of patrolling ants of Camponotus sp. We compared the leaf conditions of rattans with and without patrolling ants, testing whether the presence of ants is linked to improved leaf health. The leaflets of plants with patrolling ants were significantly less physically damaged and less covered by epiphylls. On average, 19% of the leaflets of plants with patrolling ants were damaged (52% in plants without patrolling ants), and the epiphyll cover of their leaflets was 0.2 on our scale of 0-4 (1.3 in plants without patrolling ants). Our results suggest that this poorly studied plant-ant association has a mutualistic character. It seems that the ants take advantage of the nesting space created by the plant partner, while the plants gain protection for their photosynthetic apparatus against herbivores and epiphylls.",

Raids appear usually to take independent courses & are capable of tracking areas of high food density.  However, raid advance is not dependent on continual food discovery at the raid front, since raids can advance over areas without food.  Most raids extend from trunk trails, which originate when the basal trail of a raid remains in use even after the original raid has ceased.  Trunk trails can last at least as long as 10 weeks, with the terrain & the distance to the nest influencing the trail stability.  Territories are limited to the trail systems, with rich food items in particular being vigorously defended.  Group hunting permits P. diversus to quickly harvest booty, usurp foods from competing species, & capture large prey.  This strategy is compared with the raiding strategies of other ants.  I hypothesize that group hunting originated from an ancestor which hunted solitarily from trunk trails through the acceleration of trail production and reduction in worker autonomy.]",

In return, the crazy ants are protecting these insects from predators like ant-mimicking spiders Myrmarachne sp. and garden lizards Calotes versicolor (Daudin, 1802).

    "abstract": "Exotic grasses such as bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) are widely established across the southeastern United States as livestock forage, but their structure and management can limit avian reproductive success. Native warm-season grasses (NWSG) are promoted as sustainable forage alternatives. To examine nesting suitability for tall structure specialists such as Dickcissels (Spiza americana) we established an operational-scale study in northeastern Mississippi, USA, with 4 treatments along a gradient of beef production intensity. Treatments included grazed exotic forages, 2 grazed NWSG treatments including Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) monoculture and NWSG polyculture of Indiangrass, little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), and an ungrazed NWSG polyculture treatment. We monitored 208 Dickcissel nests in 2011 and 2012 to evaluate effects of treatment, vegetation structure, fire ants (Solenopsis spp.), and arthropod prey biomass on nest-site selection and nest survival. Survival rates varied among treatments and increased with pasture-scale visual obstruction reading (VOR), being lowest among grazed exotic grass, intermediate in grazed NWSG, and highest in ungrazed NWSG. Although Dickcissels selected nest sites with greater VOR, we found little support for effects of nest-site vegetation on survival. However, nest survival was lower for nests in shrubs that also occurred in pastures with greater shrub cover, and selection for shrubs declined as pasture-scale VOR increased, suggesting a functional response in selection. We found little support for food availability influencing nest survival. These results suggest NWSG pastures increase Dickcissel nest success through greater pasture-scale VOR by reducing Dickcissel selection of shrubs for nest sites, and possibly by reducing predator efficiency. Incorporating NWSG into beef production systems while maintaining availability of tall vegetation could benefit Dickcissels and other tall structure specialists.",

Three species (Odontoponera transversa, Pachycondyla indica, and Pachycondyla obscuricornis) contained a mixture of alkylpyrazines and oxygenated compounds and some simple terpenes; and the remaining two (Diacamma vagans and a Diacamma sp. from India) had only oxygenated compounds present. The two Diacamma species were notable in containing a dioxaspiroundecane (a spiroketal), not hitherto found in ants. All the 33 known mandibular gland analyses of workers of ponerine ant species have been brought together in order to seek some pattern in the type of glandular contents.

    "abstract": "Seabirds endemic to remote oceanic islands face several unique threats to their population viability. Christmas Island is a small oceanic island with remarkable seabird biodiversity, including two endangered endemics: Christmas Island frigatebirds (Fregata andrewsi) and Abbott's boobies (Papasula abbotti). Christmas Island seabirds are currently threatened by habitat destruction at breeding sites due to phosphate mining and by the adverse effects of the invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes); however, conservation initiatives are limited by a paucity of genetic data on the breeding seabirds. To address this shortcoming, we collected genetic samples from five breeding seabird species, including the two endemics. We surveyed mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity, estimated effective population sizes, and tested whether species had undergone recent or long-term effective population size decline. Effective population sizes for Christmas Island frigatebirds and Abbott's boobies were both low (approximately 5,000 and 2,100 individuals, respectively). Moreover, four out of the five species appeared to have undergone long-term population decline, suggesting that mitigation of the threats to population viability of Christmas Island seabirds is critical. We also detected cryptic population genetic structure within Abbott's booby, perhaps due to in situ divergence on Christmas Island or due to the influx of individuals from an extirpated colony. Within-island differentiation may be common among endemic seabird species due to high levels of natal philopatry, and we suggest that careful consideration of population genetic structure on small geographic scales is crucial when designing conservation initiatives.",

    "abstract": "*[Species may reach oceanic islands by 3 mechanisms: (1) mating flights of reproductives, (2) rafting, and (3) human-assisted dispersal.  Past land bridge connections may be important for continental shelf islands.  Patterns of species accumulation may be similar even when primary mechanisms of dispersal differ.  Colonizing propagules are limited primarily by the presence of suitable habitat & interspecific competition or predation from other ants.  Although island area is usually a significant predictor of species richness, the diversity of habitat types is often a better predictor.  Distance, or isolation, has often been found to be only a weak predictor of ant species richness, probably because many islands that have been studied are not very distant relative to most species' dispersal abilities.  Interspecific competition appears to result in mutually exclusive distributions within islands for some of the more aggressive species, although the effects of habitat affinities have not been well studied.  With the exception of very small islands, competition does not appear to result in exclusions of species from entire islands, & robust patterns of nestedness have been observed.  Populations go extinct from & immigrate to small islands in ecological time, although such turnover appears to be relatively low compared with other arthropods.  Only a few archipelagoes, however, have been the focus of turnover studies.  Some species may reach extremely high population abundances on islands, but subsequently decline.  The exact mechanisms underlying these population fluctuations are not known with certainty, although the presence of honeydew-producing insects has often been associated with the most dramatic cases.  Endemicity varies greatly and ranges from 0 to > 96%, peaking at intermediate distances in the Pacific & reaching the highest levels on islands in the Indian Ocean.  Anthropogenic disturbances appear to present the greatest driver of change to insular ant communities & result in increasing numbers & abundances of exotic ant species, which may have deleterious effects on the rest of the community.]",

    "abstract": "In many animal species, individuals re-use the breeding site they used in the previous breeding season. Consequently, they accrue benefits including reduced time searching for a territory, and enhanced predator avoidance. Many seabirds display high levels of nest-site fidelity. We sought to determine whether nest-site fidelity occurs in Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) breeding at Ashmore Reef (eastern Indian Ocean) by recording the nest location of individually-marked birds across three years (2012\u00132014). We found that Red-tailed Tropicbirds at this surface-nesting colony were highly faithful to their previous nest-site, with a median distance between successive nests of just 13.4 m. By using digitised vegetation maps for Ashmore Reef, we provide quantitative evidence that Red-tailed Tropicbird nest-site fidelity is not driven by a lack of suitable vegetated sites. These findings have important management implications because breeding success at this small, regionally-significant Red-tailed Tropicbird colony is negatively affected by an invasive species, the tropical fire ant (Solenopsis geminata). Using localised ant baiting around known Red-tailed Tropicbird nest-sites may confer benefits on current and future tropicbird breeding attempts. We estimated the financial cost per treatment to bait the 0.85 ha within 13.4 m of known Red-tailed Tropicbird nest-sites, an area expected to encompass half of all subsequent breeding attempts, to be low. This represents a cost-effective interim management strategy prior to any island-wide eradication programme. Therefore, we recommend localised ant baiting around tropicbird nests within an adaptive management framework such that optimum baiting parameters can be resolved (e.g., baiting frequency, most effective baiting radius).",

    "abstract": "Animals are known to acquire and store information of their environment in order to enhance their performance in different tasks like foraging, migration and breeding. Having information regarding nesting sites would be particularly useful when they have to relocate. In the current study, we asked if having information of a new nest prior to or at the onset of relocation has a positive impact on the ability of ant colonies to relocate. We performed five sets of experiments on a ponerine ant species Diacamma indicum that recruits nestmates solely by tandem running. By analyzing data of 4756 unique ants across 61 colonies, we found that, access to information of the new nest for 1 day prior to the relocation did not give any significant advantage as compared to no prior information of the new nest. However, access to information for 7\tdays prior to relocation resulted in 50% increase in the number of tandem leaders and reduction of the transport time by an average of 49%. Our data on providing information at the onset of relocation indicates that introducing explorers to the new nest did not aid the process of relocation but when information of a new nest was self\u0010acquired, there was a reduction in discovery time by 50% and also in the transport time per unit distance for relocation into a new nest. Having information regarding only the surroundings and not the nest at the onset of a relocation did not give any significant advantages. Further, the manner in which work was organized during the relocation process was not significantly influenced by prior information across any of the treatments. Our findings suggest that information of new nest is important and when such information is self\u0010acquired at the onset of relocation or is available for a long enough duration, it has a positive influence in the process of relocation in this ant species.",

    "abstract": "Nectar larcenists extract nectar from flowers without pollinating them. A reasonable expectation is that any form of nectar larceny should have a detrimental effect on the plant\u0019s reproductive success. However, studies reveal an entire range of effects, from highly negative to highly positive. This variation in effect may be partly explained by additional, unmeasured, effects of nectar larcenists on plants. In a study system where two ant species Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabr.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and Trichomyrmex destructor (Jerd.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) act as nectar larcenists, we examined the effect of larceny on the female reproductive success of Clerodendrum infortunatum Gaertn. (Lamiales: Lamiaceae) in rain forest fragments of the Western Ghats, India. This was done through a combination of field observations and a series of field experiments looking at the effects of excluding ants from inflorescences. We found that T. destructor reduces fruit set considerably. Rather than this being a consequence of nectar larceny, however, our experiments show that the negative effect arises instead from the herbivorous behavior of the ant. At a population level, both ant species prefer edges over interiors of forest patches, spatially concentrating the interaction zone to forest edges.

Little is known about the importance of visual cues when the whole colony engages in the goal\u0010oriented task of colony relocation. In this study, we investigated the role of vision for a tandem\u0010running tropical ant Diacamma indicum during colony relocation by impairing the vision in both eyes of all colony members and comparing our findings with ants having unimpaired vision. Colonies relocated successfully under zero\u0010lux conditions and when all colony mates were visually impaired, without compromising their colony cohesion. On examining 265 tandem runs performed by visually impaired ants, we found that they had lower efficiency as compared to ants with normal vision. They traveled along longer routes at lower speeds and often lost their followers, leading to significant increase in transportation time. The absence of visual inputs did not influence the number of tandem leaders that participated nor did it negatively impact their ability to recruit their visually impaired followers from becoming tandem leaders. Visually impaired tandem leaders were not able to minimize their relocation path in an open arena but were capable of doing so in defined paths. Our results suggest that these ants use thigmotactic or proprioceptive cues in order to navigate to their new nest in the absence of visual inputs. Our understanding of tandem\u0010running recruitment would be incomplete until we delineate the role of multiple sensory inputs involved in conducting this mode of recruitment successfully.",

As colony relocation directly impacts the survival of the whole colony, it would be particularly important to optimize their path to the new nest.  Using the ponerine ant Diacamma indicum, we conducted relocation experiments, in which ants had to choose between different defined paths, & contrasted our findings with open arena experiments, as they navigated to their new nest.  After following 4100 unique transports by 450 different transporters, we found that these ants do minimize their path.  Individual leaders, as well as colonies, chose the shorter path significantly more than the longer path, & they showed a significant preference for the shorter arm at multiple decision points on encountering a combination of paths.  Thus, we concluded that tandem leaders are capable of path minimization based on the information they themselves collect.]",

Notably, there is a significant difference in the number and size of glomeruli between the reproductives and the workers and among the different worker castes. In this report, we investigate the notion that these caste-specific differences in glomerular number might be accounted for, at least in part, by the differences in numbers of olfactory sensilla that target the antennal lobe. For this, we examine the number of sensilla on the antennal flagella of all the individual castes of C. compressus. This analysis reveals a striking correlation between sensillar number and the number of antennal glomeruli in a given caste. As a first step in investigating the causal mechanisms that might give raise to this correlation, we carry out an initial characterization of olfactory system development in the minor workers of C. compressus. We analyze the temporal pattern of innervations of the developing antennal lobe by olfactory sensory neuron axons. We document the development of the olfactory glomeruli in the antennal lobe during this process, which occurs during early pupal stages. Our findings provide the basis for future manipulative developmental studies on the role of sensory afferent number in glomerular development of different castes within the same species.",

The reproductives and worker classes are readily categorized based on size and external morphology. The overall organization of brain neuropile is comparable between castes with differences only in the visual ganglia. Males have a larger fraction of neuropile occupied by the medulla and lobula than females. In the diurnal species, C. sericeus these regions are more highly represented, than in the nocturnal species C. compressus. The most striking differences are in the antennal lobe where males possess a macroglomerulus, which is about ten times larger in volume than the other glomeruli; such a specialization is absent in females. Minor workers possess a significantly larger number of glomeruli than the majors despite the smaller overall volume of the lobe. These caste-specific differences occur mainly within glomerular clusters that receive input from sensory neurons that project in tracts - T4 and T5 - within the antennal nerve. The comparative anatomy of different castes of ants provides an entry point into a future systematic analysis of how divergent brain architectures can arise within a single species.",

    "abstract": "Ant species often have multiple morphologically distinct 'castes' within a single colony. Given that most of these castes are involved in non-reproductive tasks, and since such individuals thus never reproduce, the question of how ant castes can evolve is a non-trivial one. Over the years, several models have been proposed in order to explain the evolution of castes in ant colonies. Here, we attempt to answer this question using an economics-based approach, developing an optimization model that implements adaptation and selection at the colony level. We argue that due to the nature of ant colonies, selection is shifted to the group level, and, due to this, individual ants are sheltered from negative selection. We show that our framework can explain the evolution of novel castes in ant colonies, and discuss the novelty of our model with regard to previous models that have been proposed. We also show that our model is consistent with several empirical observations of ant colonies.",

It was observed that ants could not continue to move along the trail line in case of both the obstructions causing chaos & crowding at the point of intersection with the object.  However, in the case of the linear object, they were found to rejoin the broken trail by creating 2 distinct paths, one parabolic, & another straighter one with a acute U turn along the object.  In both cases, the paths were created towards the shorter section of the obstacle.  In the case of the circular object, a semicircular path was formed along the circumference of the object.  There was no distinct bifurcation as in the case of the linear object.]",

    "abstract": "The thief ant, Solenopsis molesta (Say): a common nuisance species found through-out the United States is genetically related to red imported fire ants, S. invicta Buren. Therefore, its identification at the molecular level is very important. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) barcoding, a recent technique was used to identify thief ant complex at species and subspecies levels using short DNA sequence from the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mitochondrial region. The DNA from thief ants collected from 9 states was extracted using Qiagen's Gentra PUREGENE DNA Isolation Kit. The polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were run on the extracted DNA to amplify partial sequence of COI using primers Lep-Fl (forward) and Lep-Rl (reverse). The resulting DNA products were concentrated, purified and sequenced. The 600 bp sequences of the COI generated were submitted to GenBank that issued accessions numbers from HM179641 to HM179653. The sequences associated with these accession numbers were used as DNA barcodes for distinguishing species and subspecies. Based on this molecular analysis, thief ants collected from New York, Indiana and 1 location in Nebraska were separated in 1 group as S. molesta validiuscula (Emery) and another with ants from Louisiana identified as S. carolinensis (Forel). The third group was comprised of ants from South Dakota, Washington, New Jersey, Tennessee, Kansas and 2 other locations in Nebraska was identified as S. molesta molesta (Say).",

We found that NDVI values at the nesting sites varied considerably between individual species & also between the 6 functional groups the ants belong to.  The functional groups cryptic species, tropical climate specialists, & specialist predators were present in regions with high NDVI.  Hot climate specialists & opportunists were found in sites with low NDVI.  As expected, we found that low NDVI values were associated with scrub jungles & high NDVI values with evergreen forests.  Interestingly, we found that Pachycondyla rufipes, an ant species found only in deciduous and evergreen forests, established nests only in sites with low NDVI (range = 0.015 - 0.1779).  Our results show that these low NDVI values in deciduous & evergreen forests correspond to canopy gaps in otherwise closed deciduous & evergreen forests.

Historical data indicated that T. somervilli and other Tachardiaephagus spp. have narrow host ranges restricted to lac scales (Kerriidae). Furthermore, none of the 40 encyrtid species known to parasitize lac scales has a host range extending beyond the Coccoidea, and no encyrtid species is known that bridges the phylogenetic distance between their kerriid hosts and the families of any endemic Hemiptera found on Christmas Island. No-choice host specificity tests conducted in the field in the native range of Tachardina aurantiaca showed that none of the eight test species (Coccoidea) were parasitized by T. somervilli. These results predict that release of T. somervilli on Christmas Island will have negligible risks of non-target impacts.

Mutualism between scale insects and the invasive ant Anoplolepis gracilipes on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, threatens the conservation of the island's endemic land crab fauna, alters rainforest structure and composition, and disrupts ecosystem processes. Diversity and endemism of the scale insect fauna were assessed through broad survey across rainforest, targeted search on endemic plant species, and inspection of ornamental and horticultural plants in settled areas. Emphasis was placed on honeydew-producing species that sustain ant supercolonies and detection of endemic scale insects that could be non-target species in a biological control programme for honeydew-producing scale insects. Origins of the fauna were inferred using scale insect databases and interception records at Ports-of-Entry for the United States and Korea. Twenty-eight scale insect species in seven families are identified for the island. Four honeydew-producing species, the lac scale Tachardina aurantiaca (Kerriidae) and three soft scale species (Coccidae), are abundant in rainforest and tended by ants. No endemic species were found. Compositionally, the scale insect fauna resembles that of many other tropical islands: almost all species are biogeographically widespread, host-plant generalists, and routinely intercepted in human-mediated dispersal pathways. The likely source bioregion is Sundaland where 27 of the 28 species on the island have been recorded and which has been the major pathway for movement of plant material to the island for over a century.",

We considered whether mutualism between invasive yellow crazy ant Anoplolepis gracilipes and exotic honeydew-producing scale insects indirectly facilitated land snails (exotic and native) via the removal of a native omnivore, the red land crab Gecarcoidea natalis. In plateau rainforest on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, the land snail community was surveyed at 28 sites representing four forest states that differed in the density of red crabs, the abundance of yellow crazy ants and management history. One-way ANOVAs and multivariate analyses were used to determine differences in land snail species abundance and composition between forest states. Sample-based rarefaction was used to determine differences in species richness. The removal of the red land crab by supercolonies of yellow crazy ants was associated with a significant increase in the abundance of both invasive (14 species) and native (four species) land snails. Compositional differences in the land snail community were driven most strongly by the significantly greater abundance of a few common species in forest states devoid of red crabs. In forest where the crab population had recovered following management for ants, the land snail assemblage did not differ from intact, uninvaded forest. The land snail community was dominated by exotic species that can coexist alongside red crabs in rainforest uninvaded by exotic ants and scale insects. However, the ant-scale mutualism significantly increased land snail abundance and altered their composition indirectly though the alteration of the recipient community. We suggest these constitute 'population-release' secondary invasion in which the impacts of previously successful invaders facilitate a significant increase in abundance of other exotic species already established at low density within the community. Understanding facilitative interactions between invaders and indirect consequences of impacts will provide invaluable insights for conservation in heavily invaded ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The entry of secondary invaders into, or their expansion within, native communities is contingent on the changes wrought by other (primary) invaders. When primary invaders have altered more than one property of the recipient community, standard descriptive and modeling approaches only provide a best guess of the mechanism permitting the secondary invasion. In rainforest on Christmas Island, we conducted a manipulative field experiment to determine the mechanism of invasion success for a community of land snails dominated by non\u0010native species. The invasion of rainforest by the yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes) has facilitated these land snails, either by creating enemy\u0010free space and/or increased habitat and resources (in the form of leaf litter) through the removal of the native omnivorous\u0010detritivorous red land crab (Gecarcoidea natalis). We manipulated predator densities (high and low) and leaf litter (high and low) in replicated blocks of four treatment combinations at two sites. Over the course of one wet season (five months), we found that plots with high leaf litter biomass contained significantly more snails than those with low biomass, regardless of whether those plots had high or low predation pressure, at both the site where land crabs have always been abundant, and at the site where they have been absent for many years prior to the experiment. Each site was dominated by small snail species (<2 mm length), and through handling size and predation experiments we demonstrated that red crabs tend not to handle and eat snails of that size. These results suggest that secondary invasion by this community of non\u0010native land snails is facilitated most strongly by habitat and resource augmentation, an indirect consequence of red land crab removal, and that the creation of enemy\u0010free space is not important. By using a full\u0010factorial experimental approach, we have confidently determined - rather than inferred - the mechanism by which primary invaders indirectly facilitate a community of secondary invaders.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of empirical evidence, invasive species are often assumed to have negative impacts because of their conspicuously high abundance. The giant African land snail Achatina (Lissachatina) fulica is one such invader where its impact in natural ecosystems remains completely untested. On Christmas Island (Indian Ocean), A. fulica has become established across large tracts of rainforest following the impacts of invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes) in mutualism with non\u0010native scale insects. Yellow crazy ants facilitate the secondary invasion of A. fulica by extirpating native red land crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis) that are normally effective predators of A. fulica. We used a multifaceted approach to investigate some potential impacts of abundant A. fulica in invaded rainforest. Over the course of a wet season, diel activity transects showed that A. fulica consumed detrital material almost exclusively. However, stable isotope analysis did not confidently identify A. fulica as a predominantly detritivorous species. We found no statistically significant treatment effects of A. fulica exclusion on standing leaf litter and seedling recruitment processes during a 6\u0010month manipulative field study. However, litter cover and biomass did remain slightly higher where A. fulica were excluded, albeit with overlapping confidence intervals with control plots. Our study constitutes the first empirical test for impact of A. fulica in a natural ecosystem and suggests that for Christmas Island rainforest, this species is not a damaging invader. Other studies will need to assess the impacts of A. fulica in other natural areas before these findings could be considered broadly applicable.",

    "abstract": "With an expanding human population placing increasing pressure on the environment, agriculture needs sustainable production that can match conventional methods. Integrated pest management (IPM) is more sustainable, but not necessarily as efficient as conventional non-sustainable measures.  Being predatory and organized as superorganisms, ants possess traits making them suitable agents in IPM. Recent works on weaver ants Oecophylla spp. showcase ants as highly efficient pest controllers. A synthesis shows that weaver ants can reduce pest numbers and their damage and increase yields in multiple crops. Their efficiency is comparable to chemical pesticides or higher, while at lower costs. They provide a rare example of documented efficient conservation biological control.  Weaver ants share beneficial traits with almost 13 000 other ant species and are unlikely to be unique in their properties as control agents. A synthesis of applied work on other ant species illustrates potentials for control of arthropod pests, weeds and plant diseases in orchards, forestry and arable crops.  Synthesis and applications. By showing that ant biocontrol can match synthetic pesticides in a wide setting of agricultural systems, this review emphasizes the potential of managing ants to achieve sustainable pest management solutions. The synthesis suggests future directions and may catalyse a research agenda on the utilization of ants, not only against arthropod pests, but also against weeds and plant diseases. Lastly, it may stimulate implementation of already proven ant-based integrated pest management techniques.",

    "abstract": "*[The ant genus Perissomyrmex is one of the 4 extant genera of the tribe Myrmecinini.  The present study revises the genus including a definition of the taxon, a description of a new species from China, discussions on the phylogenetic position in the tribe & biogeography.  Our phylogenetic analysis based on morphological characters shows that first the tribe Myrmecinini is justified as a monophyletic taxon by the structures of the antennal base & the labrum.  Second, the genera Perissomyrmex & Pristomyrmex are sister groups, sharing the short masticatory margin of the mandible nearly vertical to the long axis of the head & more or less raised structure on the basal margin of the mandibles.  Third, each of the genera is recognized as a monophyletic taxon.  Our provisional conclusion of the phylogeny is (Myrmecina + (Acanthomyrmex + (Pristomyrmex + Perissomyrmex))).   A key to the 4 species of Perissomyrmex is given.  P. snyderi from Central America is distinctive in having a subpetiolar process & 3 other Asian species are distinguishable by the dentition on the anterior clypeal margin and the shape of the ventral margin of the petiole.  The disjunct distribution of the genus is also discussed.  The discovery of a fourth species from SW China, Perissomyrmex emarginatus, n.sp., suggests that the genus is an old temperate ant living in the boundary to northern zoogeographical regions.  Judging from the sister group relation to Pristomyrmex that occurs in the Old World tropics & from higher species diversity in Asia, Perissomyrmex would have originated in Asia.  The fossil record of Ennaemerus in Baltic Amber suggests that the Proto-Perissomyrmex might have Arcto-Tertiary distribution, & the present distribution would be a relic of the old temperate range in Paleogene.]",

    "abstract": "*[Sixteen species of ants collected from Karnataka, India, were sequenced & barcoded for a 658 bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1).  This gene is frequently termed as CO1 in barcoding approach & serves as the core of a global bioidentification marker for insects & other animals.  The AT content in DNA of 16 ant species was estimated as 68.55%, which is in accordance with invertebrates.  The variance of AT content among species was much higher for the 1st base (AT1) compared to the 2nd & 3rd bases, which were nearly invariant.  The distance within species was calculated using Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) & it was 0.166, 0.000 & 0.333% for mean, minimum, & maximum, respectively.  Moreover, our data also showed some phylogenetic signal.  In a neighbor-joining tree for all sequences, 2 clusters were obtained, the first cluster consisted of subfamilies Formicinae & Myrmicinae, while other clade showed relationship between subfamily Myrmicinae & Ponerinae clustered with subfamily Dolichodrinae, which is not in contradiction with cladistics analysis of morphological data for ants & is consistent with traditional phylogeny of ants.  The present results thus favor DNA barcoding as a decisive tool in quick & reliable identifications of ants.]",

Sugar-based bait was used monthly to examine the interaction between AWA, BHA, and CPA, as well as other species of ants. There were significant differences in the abundance of AWA, BHA, CPA, and other ant species foraging at the baits (F (3.36) = 5.43; P = 0.002) and (F(3.36) = 11.69; P < 0.0001) at Bagamoyo and Mkuranga, respectively, in 2010. The mean amacronbundances of AWA, BHA, CPA, and 'others' were 66.6, 24.6, 35.0, and 59.5 %, respectively, at Bagamoyo in 2010. A similar trend was observed in 2011. The abundance of AWA was significantly negatively correlated with BHA (r (39) = -0.30; P < 0.0001) and CPA (r (39) = -0.18; P = 0.01) at Bagamoyo in 2010. A similar trend was also observed at Mkuranga. The abundance of AWA was therefore negatively affected by the presence of the two dominant ants, BHA and CPA, which may hinder the effectiveness of AWA to control sap-sucking pests in cashew. Therefore, suppression of BHA and CPA should be emphasized for effective control of the sap-sucking pests using AWA.",

    "abstract": "Soil macrofauna diversity in Himalayan mountain agroecosystems has received negligible attention despite people\u0019s dependence on soil fertility that determines crop yield for their sustenance. This study was carried out with the objective to determine differences in soil macrofauna taxonomic groups and abundance with soil depth (0\u001330 cm) in irrigated and non-irrigated wheat and rice crops of two dominant Himalayan mountain agroecosystems. At both the sites, a total of 11 macrofauna groups and 23 families were recorded. Macrofauna population across both crop seasons for non-irrigated fields was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than in irrigated fields. Macrofauna population significantly differed (P < 0.001) with soil depth and significantly declined with increasing soil depth (P < 0.001). The top soil (0\u001310 cm depth) contributed over 80% of the total macrofauna population. Macrofauna diversity in non-irrigated fields (H2 = 2.10) was greater than in irrigated fields (H2 = 1.86), but ≤ diversity was greater in irrigated fields (1.67 vs 1.76). The two agroecosystem types significantly differed (P < 0.05) with soil depth and crop season. On the basis of presence or absence, the macrofauna groups were categorised as (i) present in soil year-round but exhibiting high density during warm and wet rainy season and (ii) present in soil only during the warm and wet rainy season. The non-irrigated fields had greater abundance of Coleoptera, Dermaptera, Hemiptera and Isoptera than the irrigated fields. This study highlights that the Himalayan mountain crop fields host a rather diverse and abundant macro-invertebrate community that should be efficiently used to promote soil fertility.          *[NOTE: These identifications need to be checked.

    "abstract": "A better understanding of seed movement in plant community dynamics is needed, especially in light of disturbance\u0010driven changes and investments into restoring degraded plant communities. A primary agent of change within the sagebrush\u0010steppe is wildfire and invasion by non\u0010native forbs and grasses, primarily cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). Our objectives were to quantify seed removal and evaluate ecological factors influencing seed removal within degraded sagebrush\u0010steppe by granivorous Owyhee harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex salinus Olsen). In 2014, we sampled 76 harvester ant nests across 11 plots spanning a gradient of cheatgrass invasion (40%-91% cover) in southwestern Idaho, United States. We presented seeds from four plant species commonly used in postfire restoration at 1.5 and 3.0 m from each nest to quantify seed removal. We evaluated seed selection for presented species, monthly removal, and whether biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., distance to nearest nest, temperature) influenced seed removal. Our top model indicated seed removal was positively correlated with nest height, an indicator of colony size. Distance to seeds and cheatgrass canopy cover reduced seed removal, likely due to increased search and handling time. Harvester ants were selective, removing Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) more than any other species presented. We suspect this was due to ease of seed handling and low weight variability. Nest density influenced monthly seed removal, as we estimated monthly removal of 1,890 seeds for 0.25 ha plots with 1 nest and 29,850 seeds for plots with 15 nests. Applying monthly seed removal to historical restoration treatments across the western United States showed harvester ants can greatly reduce seed availability at degraded sagebrush sites; for instance, fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) seeds could be removed in <2 months. Collectively, these results shed light on seed removal by harvester ants and emphasize their potential influence on postfire restoration within invaded sagebrush communities.

Here, we report the earliest known morphologically specialized & apparently obligate myrmecophile, in Early Eocene (~52 million years old) Cambay amber from India.  Protoclaviger trichodens gen.nov. et sp.nov. is a stem-group member of Clavigeritae, a speciose supertribe of pselaphine rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) heavily modified for myrmecophily via reduced mouthparts for trophallaxis with worker ants, brush-like trichomes that exude appeasement compounds, & fusions of many body & antennal segments.  Protoclaviger captures a transitional stage in the evolutionary development of this novel body plan, most evident in its still-distinct abdominal tergites.  The Cambay paleobiota marks one of the first occurrences in the fossil record of a significant presence of modern ants.  Protoclaviger reveals that sophisticated social parasites were nest intruders throughout, & probably before, the ascent of ants to ecological dominance, with ancient groups such as Clavigeritae primed to radiate as their hosts became increasingly ubiquitous.]",

This paper documents the effect of different vegetation and environmental factors on ant community structure and functional group composition in different habitat patches. Ants were sampled at 16 sites distributed across five habitat types in the Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary. Sampling was performed 10 times over a 2-y period using pitfall traps. A total of 100 species belonging to 41 genera were collected during the study. Ant species richness was best explained by a combination of percentage grass cover, percentage litter cover and number of saplings whereas percentage litter cover and soil nitrogen concentration significantly explained the variation in ant species abundance. Dominant Dolichoderinae were present only at forest edge and were found to be associated positively with percentage bare ground cover and negatively with percentage litter cover. Generalized Myrmicinae, subordinate Camponotini and tropical climate specialists were prevalent in shaded forest habitats whereas opportunists were more common in two types of open habitat. Our study underpins the influence of vegetational complexity, litter and soil chemical properties on the structure and composition of ant species assemblages and various functional groups across forested habitats in this little-studied region.",

The present record of cryptic coloration of coccid Saissetia filicum Boisduval (Homoptera: Coccidae) to the sori of a fern species Asplenium nidus L. (Aspleniaceae) is unique. Predatory beetles (Jauravia sp., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) that feed on the coccids, are suggested to be selective pressure for the development of the present homopteran soral crypsis. A higher rate of effective predation is noticed in the vegetative leaves than the fertile leaves. Aggressive ants were found harvesting honeydew secretions from the coccids and defending the trophobionts as well as the host fern from their natural enemies. In addition, a possible three-way mutualistic relationship among the coccids, its host fern and the tending ant is suggested. Differential numbers of coccids on vegetative and fertile leaves is correlated with their phenol content and degree of predation by beetles. Such coloration mimicry by the coccids may enable them to obtain the necessary blend of sorus of the host fern needed to evade beetle detection and attack.",

Solenopsis geminata may have been introduced into the Northern Hemisphere 200-300 years ago as the new world was settled. The introduction had little impact on the native ants. Solenopsis richteri, a native of Argentina and Uruguay was intoduced into Mobile, Alabama where it was identified in the early 1930's as a serious problem because of its aggressive nature. Then approximately a decade later a second aggressive species, S. invicta, began spreading across southeastern U.S. The red imported fire ant quickly became the dominant ant species displacing the other three Solenopsis species as well as many other native ants found in suitable fire ant habitats. S. richteri which is slightly more cold tolerant is now confined to the Northern border areas where S. invicta is less successful. S. xyloni and S. geminata are found mainly in areas where S. invicta has not established itself or in drier habitats.",

Diacamma indicum, a locally abundant native ponerine species, was used as the model system for this study.  This species is known to use tandem running (a relatively primitive form of recruitment, where a leader walks its follower from one location to another while maintaining physical contact throughout the process) for nest relocation.  In lab based experiments, 3 different levels of stress were applied to the colonies such that they were forced to relocate: first with only  physical  disturbance, where colony structure was disturbed, in the second, an increase in light intensity was applied along with physical disturbance, & in the third, the temperature of the nest was increased along with physical disturbance & increased light intensity.  No significant increase was detected in either the relocation time or the rate of relocation with increasing stress.   Similarly, there was no significant impact on the division of labor among the leaders, who were responsible for carrying out the relocation process with increasing stress.  Thus, we conclude that D. indicum colonies are immune to the stress levels, we subjected them to & that the relocation process they employ is rather robust.]",

    "abstract": "The life history of Harpegnathos saltator is exceptional among ants because both queens and workers reproduce sexually. Recently mated queens start new colonies alone, but later some of the offspring workers also become inseminated and take over the egg-laying role. This alternation seems associated with the existence of very complex underground nests, which are designed to survive floods. Longevity of ponerine queens is low (a consequence of limited caste dimorphism in this \"primitive\" subfamily), and upon the death of an H. saltator foundress, the nest represents a substantial investment. The queen's progeny should thus be strongly selected to retain the valuable nests. Unlike the flying queens, the workers copulate with males from their own colonies, and, thus, their offspring are expected to be highly related to the foundress. Colony fission appears not to occur because a daughter fragment would lack an adequate nest for protection. Thus, the annual production of queens in colonies with reproductive workers remains essential for the establishment of new colonies. This contrasts with various other ponerine species in which the queens no longer exist.",

At the colony level, workers must have a mechanism to regulate larval development to prevent queens from developing out of season.  I identified a new behavior in H. saltator where workers bite larvae to inhibit queen determination.  Workers could identify larval caste based on a chemical signal specific to queen-destined larvae, & the production of this signal was directly linked to increased juvenile hormone levels.  This association provides a connection between the physiological factors that induce queen development & the production of a caste-specific larval signal.  In addition to caste determination at the larval stage, adult workers of H. saltator compete to establish a reproductive hierarchy.  Unlike other social insects, dominance in H. saltator was not related to differences in juvenile hormone or ecdysteroid levels.  Instead, changes in brain levels of biogenic amines, particularly dopamine, were correlated with dominance & reproductive status.  Receptor genes for dopamine were expressed in both the brain & ovaries of H. saltator, & this suggests that dopamine may coordinate changes in behavior at the neurological level with ovarian status.

    "abstract": "Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in H. saltator as well as drive differences in worker task performance.

Current methods for determining larval sex rely on genetic analyses or histology, both of which require killing all larvae examined.

Using a light microscope, clear differences in genital disc morphology were observed between male and female larvae of the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator. Next, we investigated whether this technique could be broadly applied within ants and found similar differences in genital discs between male and female larvae of Aphaenogaster cockerelli and Camponotus floridanus. Taken together, our results show that genital discs can be used as a reliable indicator of larval sex in species from at least three major ant subfamilies.

    "abstract": "Extreme developmental plasticity within the eusocial insects defines the separation between the queen and worker castes. The switch between these 2 developmental pathways is thought to be under tight social control. Although a large emphasis has been placed on the effect of larval nutrition on caste determination, workers of many species have no direct control over larval feeding. This may be particularly relevant to the early evolution of ants, when behaviors that allow fine control over larval nutrition, such as mouth-to-mouth food exchange between larvae and workers, were probably not yet present. We investigated larval-directed aggression as an alternative means to regulate queen development in the ant Harpegnathos saltator, a species that retains ancestral characteristics. We tested worker response toward natural queen-destined larvae and larvae induced to develop as queens using a juvenile hormone analog (JHA). Workers from colonies that were not rearing queens bit queen-destined larvae, whereas worker-destined larvae were not attacked. When colonies were naturally rearing queens, workers did not bite JHA-treated larvae, and a larger proportion of these larvae developed into queens compared with larvae that received biting. This supports the hypothesis that workers of H. saltator use biting to inhibit queen development during periods when the conditions for queen rearing are not met. We propose that mechanical stress, in addition to nutrition, could serve as a mechanism to regulate queen development in species that lack fine control over larval food consumption, and this may have played a role during the early evolution of eusociality in ants.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have identified cuticular compounds that distinguish adult queens from workers in social insect colonies, but how future queens are identified at the larval stage is poorly understood. Nevertheless, the ability of workers to discriminate queen and worker larvae is necessary for them to regulate caste determination and queen production. In the ant Harpegnathos saltator, workers bite larvae to inhibit queen development, and we used biting as an assay to test how workers identify queens at the larval stage. The transfer of cuticular compounds from queen to worker larvae through direct physical contact (rubbing) or using a hexane extract both elicited biting. Gas chromatography revealed significant differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of queen and worker larvae that could be induced by treatment with a juvenile hormone (JH) analogue. Finally, treatment of male larvae with a JH analogue also elicited worker biting, which suggests a direct connection between JH levels and the production of a larval queen signal. These results demonstrate that workers identify larval caste using a chemical signal present on the cuticle, a \u0018princess pheromone\u0019, that reflects endocrine changes associated with queen development. Based on the connection between JH levels and the production of a larval queen signal, we developed a model for caste determination in H. saltator that incorporates endocrine, pheromonal and behavioural control of caste development.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of reproduction within insect societies is a key component of the evolution of eusociality. Differential patterns of hormone levels often underlie the reproductive division of labor observed among colony members, and further task partitioning among workers is also often correlated with differences in juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroid content. We measured JH and ecdysteroid content of workers and queens of the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, new colonies are founded by a single queen, but after she dies workers compete in an elaborate dominance tournament to decide a new group of reproductives termed \"gamergates.\" Our comparisons revealed that queens, gamergates, and inside workers (non-reproductive) did not differ in levels of JH or ecdysteroids. However, increased JH and decreased ecdysteroid content was observed in outside workers exhibiting foraging behavior. Application of a JH analog to virgin queens of H. saltator, although effective at inducing dealation, failed to promote egg production. Together, these results support the hypothesis that JH has lost its reproductive function in H. saltator to regulate foraging among the worker caste.

    "abstract": "A link between hormones and developmental plasticity has long been established, but understanding how evolution has shaped the physiological systems underlying plasticity remains a major question. Within the eusocial insects, developmental plasticity helps define a reproductive division of labor through the production of distinct queen and worker castes. Caste determination may be triggered via changes in juvenile hormone (JH) levels during specific JH-sensitive periods in development. The timing of these periods, however, can vary and may relate to phenotypic differences observed among species. In order to gain insight into the evolution of caste determining systems in eusocial insects, we investigated the presence of a JH-sensitive period for queen determination in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. This species displays a number of ancestral characteristics, including low queen-worker dimorphism, and should allow insight into the early evolution of caste determining systems in ants. We identified four larval instars in H. saltator, and we found that the application of a JH analog (JHA) to third and fourth instar larvae induced queen development while treatment of early instars did not. This indicated the presence of a JH-sensitive period for queen determination at the end of the larval stage. These results contrast with what has been found in other ant species, where queen determination occurs much earlier in development. Therefore, our results suggest that caste determination originally occurred late in the larval stage in the ancestral condition but has shifted earlier in development in species that began to acquire advanced characteristics. This shift may have facilitated the development of greater queen-worker dimorphism as well as multiple worker castes.",

Therefore, disturbances can dynamically impact forest communities over time, including populations of ground-dwelling invertebrates that regulate key ecosystem processes.

Obligate myrmecophiles that do not attract ants through stridulatory or chemical signaling are limited to habitats, where ants are reliably present for other reasons, either among ant-attended hemipterans, on ant-plants, or around ant nests.  Particularly in the tropics, obligate ant associates that passively coexist with ants are more diverse than previously recognized, including, for example, hundreds of African species in the lycaenid subfamily Poritiinae.  Mutualists & parasites of ants have been reported in 11 families: Tineidae, Tortricidae, Cyclotornidae, Coleophoridae, Crambidae, Erebidae, Notodontidae, Hesperiidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae, and Riodinidae.  Altogether, myrmecophily has originated at least 30 times in Lepidoptera, & many groups may remain undiscovered.  The butterfly families Lycaenidae & Riodinidae contain the vast majority of ant-associated species: larvae of at least 3841 (71%) of the ~5390 described Lycaenidae & 308 (20%) of the ~1562 described Riodinidae are known or inferred to be ant-associated,.  Both families possess specialized, convergently developed exocrine glands & stridulatory devices to communicate with ants.  Many caterpillar-ant relationships previously characterized as mutualisms may actually be parasitic, as caterpillars can manipulate ants & ultimately exert a fitness cost.

The first objective was accomplished by surveying grocery store employees of 322 grocery stores in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas using a 28 question survey.  Grocers lacked knowledge of IPM practices, yet over half were interested in learning more about IPM.  Present management practices are pesticide intensive with limited use of alternatives including sanitation, stock rotation and trapping.  Presently, grocers depend on pest control companies to find and control problem insects in the store.  Insects reported by grocers as problems were weevils, cockroaches, flies and ants.  Extensive trapping in eight Oklahoma grocery stores targeted pet foods, cake mixes, and back room areas.  Trapping studies showed stored product insects were abundant in all stores.  The most prevalent insects found in traps included the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner); merchant grain beetle, Oryzaephilus mercator (Fauve l); and drugstore beetle, Stegobium paniceum (L.).  Stored product insects were concentrated in pet food areas and were readily found in the stores.     *[Ants were perceived to be 2-4% of insect problems in stores.  2 ants were caught in flight traps & 3 were caught in pitfall traps.]",

Forest patches are created by Indians from campo/cerrado using planting zones made from termite & ant nests mixed with mulch.  Compost heaps are prepared in existing apÍtÍ from sticks, limbs, & leaves.  These are allowed to rot, then are beaten with sticks to produce a mulch.  This mulch is subsequently taken to a selected spot in the campo and piled onto the ground.  Slight depressions in the surface are usually sought out because they are more likely to retain moisture. These depressions are filled with the mulch, which is mixed with soil from the mounds of a Nasutitermes termite & smashed up bits of the nest of an Azteca sp.  Living ants & termites are included in the mixture.  Azteca sp. ants are not only used to create soil for the mounds, but are also highly prized for their abilities to repel sauva leafcutting ants (Atta spp.).  The Azteca has a pungent smell that distinguishes it to the KayapÛ & is apparently the same smell responsible for repelling the sauva.  Colonies of the Azteca are broken into small pieces & carried to bits of forests, where no colony exists.  This transplanted colony will then begin to replicate & spread their natural protection against leaf-cutter ants.]",

    "abstract": "The present paper reports on palynology and pollination ecology of eight taxa of Amorphophallus from North Western Ghats (NWGS) and Konkan region of India. Out of ten known pollen exine ornamentations of the genus, six are represented - psilate, striate, fossulate, verrucate, scabrate and the new type 'pseudofossulate' of Amorphophallus commutatus var. wayanadensis. These diverse pollen exine ornamentations can be utilized as an important taxonomic tool to distinguish taxa and also to resolve taxonomic problems (A. commutatus complex). The pollen of all eight taxa had retained their sculptured surface (exine ornamenatation type) after acetolysis. This clearly demonstrates that these taxa do not show susceptibility to the conventional acetolysis technique as reported earlier. The present study also highlights the importance of pollen surface morphology concerning phytogeography of the genus.   Observation of pollination ecology of the studied Amorphophallus taxa reveals that all are mostly visited by beetles (Bostrichidae, Cetoniidae, Hybosoridae, Lyctidae, Nitidulidae, Rutelinae, Scarabaeidae, Staphylinidae), followed by flies (Drosophilidae, Muscidae), bees (Apidae: Trigone), ants (Formicidae, Dolichoderinae) and cockroaches (Blaberidae/Panesthiinae). The beetle families Bostrichidae, Lyctidae and Rutelinae, ant families Formicidae and Dolichoderinae and the cockroach family Blaberidae/Panesthiinae are for the first time reported as visitors in the genus Amorphophallus. Most of the taxa display features characteristic of cantharophily (beetle pollination) except A. commutatus var. commutatus and A. commutatus var. wayanadensis, where Trigona bees are the actual pollinators. The beetles (Cetoniidae, Nitidulidae, Scarabaeidae) and bees (Apidae: Trigona) are the real pollinators for the Amorphophallus species of NWGS and Konkan while rest of the insects are mere visitors for alimentary/food resources (staminode flowers, stigmatic fluid, pollen, appendix surface, appendix exudates) and using the inflorescences as mating and egg laying sites. Species belonging to the section Rhaphiophallus (Amorphophallus konkanensis and Amorphophallus sylvaticus) are pollinated by Epuraea - Haptoncurina sp. (Nitidulidae) beetles only. Generally, the species of Amorphophallus in NWGS and Konkan region with short flowering peduncle are always pollinated by dung beetles or scarabs while species bearing a long flowering peduncle are usually pollinated by Epuraea - Haptoncurina sp. (Nitidulidae) beetles and Trigona bees. Based on the comparative observations, five different phases of insect trapping in Amorphophallus taxa are characterized, focusing on the intricacies of pollination strategies of various pollinators.",

In addition, dealate gynes exhibited a worker-like range of ovarian activity.  Like workers, they lacked the putative sex pheromones on their cuticle characteristic of dispersing gynes.  Because gynes activate a worker-like phenotype after wing removal, the essential difference between the queen & worker in this species is a dispersal polyphenism.]          *[Harpegnathos saltator source colonies have been reared in the laboratory, since they were collected from S India between 1995 & 1999.]",

We collected Google Trends-R data from 20 countries within a 13-year time frame, with 156 monthly values corresponding to search-relative interest (values related to the search interest concerning the highest peak of popularity for a certain term within a certain period).  After that, we correlated the average of relative interest per country (constancy of interest) with demographic data & ant diversity & the relative interest in \u001cants\u001d among countries. The inter- & intra-annual variations in the relative interest in the search term 'ants' were also evaluated.  After that, we listed related queries & made clusters with related topics collected from each country.  We observed that: (I) the constancy of interest in the term 'ants' is correlated with higher internet access & higher ant-genera diversity; (II) countries with a closer location, & in the same hemisphere, have similar trends in relative interest independently of their languages; (III) the relative interest in 'ants' increased over the years & during warmer months (signaling seasonality).  It is noticed that (IV) there is a high demand for information about ant control.  Finally, we found that (V) historic, cultural, & linguistic similarities among countries also influence the search patterns for 'ants'.  These results can help researchers to gain insight into the psychology of the ordinary Google searcher & reveal the typical perception of ants.  They also direct, among others, grant writing, framing research, & choosing research directions & guide eventual public outreach activities.  We know myrmecologists need no convincing why ants are interesting and ecologically important, but most people only think about ants when they are annoying them & how to get rid of these animals.  The early months of the warmer seasons would be the best time frame for promotional activities on the benefits of ants.  Based on these findings, we suggest: 1) publishing information related to ants during warmer months, highlighting positive aspects of ants; 2) stimulating science education for children & teenagers in myrmecological holiday camps; 3) developing apps focused on providing information about ants, among other actions.]",

These species, the first recorded Aneuretinae in Rovno amber, were originally described from Baltic amber of similar Priabonian age.  These new records raise the number of reported ants in Rovno amber to 77 species from 39 genera & 9 subfamilies, & indicate that in the late Eocene, Aneuretinae were distributed both on the northern & southern coasts of the Paratethys.  Fossil evidence suggests that Aneuretinae originated in the Northern Hemisphere & only entered India & Sri Lanka after the Indian subcontinent collided with Asia ~59 Ma.  Why Aneuretinae survived to the present only in Sri Lanka remains a mystery.]",

Previous study on mtDNA based phylogenesis of O. smaragdina in Bangladesh has revealed the presence of the mixture of both Indian and SE Asian type of O. smaragdina. However, the nuclear DNA based study showed some inconsistency leading the chance of hybridization as colonies encountered from two localities contained O. smaragdina workers from more than one type as identified via longwave length rhodopsin (LWRh) and mitochondrial COI and Cytb gene analysis. The purpose of present study was to detect hybridization status and to find out the identical allele for Indian and SE Asian type of O. smaragdina from different colonies. A total of seven O. smaragdina colonies had been collected from Bangladesh during 2013 to December 2016. Microsatellite analysis were performed for Gene mapping and heterozygosity study with 11 microsatellite loci through electropherogrum study generated by peak scanner software. Among 11 microsatellite loci, two loci, MS 8.24 and MS 6.45 provided the identical allele position for Indian and SE Asian types while no allelic position were identified with nine microsatellite loci. The results inferred that weaver ant of both Indian and SE Asian type engage in bidirectional interspecific gene flow. The strong possibility of hybridization between these two types is inferred, which indicates that barriers to hybridization do not exist or can be completely overcome. This is unexpected, given that they are non sister species and broadly sympatric in nature. These findings also indicate the possible occurrence of hybrid-hybrid crosses in some localities of weaver ant, a phenomenon rarely observed in ants.",

In this study, shed light was given to reveal the chance of hybridized colony of O. smaragdina in Bangladesh. To asses the hybridization scenario, 28 O. smaragdina colony from 27 localities in Bangladesh were analyzed using Longwave length Rhodopsin (LWRh) nuclear gene sequences and was compared with the mtDNA sequences, which was collected from the same localities and deposited into NCBI GenBank. The inconsistency between mitochondrial and nuclear gene types was observed from two colonies of the overlapped zone of contact. These two colonies were identified as SE Asian type by mtDNA analysis however, by nuclear DNA analysis; it was identified as Indian type. These significant discrepancies within the colony suggested the possibility of hybridization of weaver ant in Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "Biologically mediated soil processes rely on soil biota to provide vital ecosystem services in natural and managed ecosystems. However, land use changes continue to impact on assemblages of soil biota and the ecosystem services they provide. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of land use intensification on the distribution and abundance of soil invertebrate communities in the Nilgiri, a human-dominated biosphere reserve of international importance. Soil invertebrates were sampled in 15 land use practices ranging from simple and intensively managed annual crop fields and monoculture tree plantations through less intensively managed agroforestry and pristine forest ecosystems. The lowest taxonomic richness was found in annual crops and coconut monoculture plantations, while the highest was in moist-deciduous and semi-evergreen forests. With 21 ant species, agroforestry systems had the highest diversity of ants followed by forest ecosystems (12 species). Earthworms and millipedes were significantly more abundant in agroforestry systems, plantations and forest ecosystems than in annual crop fields. Ants, termites, beetles, centipedes, crickets and spiders were more abundant in forest ecosystems than in other ecosystems. It is concluded that annual cropping systems have lower diversity and abundance of soil invertebrates than agroforestry and natural forest ecosystems. These results and the literature from other regions highlight the potential role that agroforestry practices can play in biodiversity conservation in an era of ever-increasing land use intensification and habitat loss.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization is a major threat to native biodiversity. Invasion of tramp species is a major consequence of urbanization, which might threaten native species. Ants are established robust ecosystem indicators. We assessed the changes of ant community in sacred groves (SGs) of urban and rural landscapes of south India between 2013 and 2019, and asked, 1) what is the effect of urbanization on ant community? 2) has the population of invasive ants, particularly Anoplolepis gracilipes \u0013 a globally notorious tramp species, changed in response to urbanization and year? 3) is species composition of ants in SGs different between landscapes and years? and 4) has the population of native ants or any ant functional groups responded with the population of invasive ants? The richness of overall species, native species, and invasive species was not affected by year or landscape, but the abundance was. In six years, the abundance of ants doubled, but due to A. gracilipes. A. gracilipes, previously restricted only in the urban SGs had established in rural SGs in six years. A significant turnover of native species was observed across years and with the population rise of A. gracilipes. While Generalist Myrmecines and Tropical Climate Specialists increased with the abundance of invasive ants, Cryptic Species decreased. We consider the stability maintained in the native species composition and richness in SGs, the aftermath of the conditions provided by SGs. However, the evident shift in the composition of native ants over the years point out how invasive ants affect the native species composition.          *[Generalist Myrmecines is incorrect, the correct term is Generalist Myrmicines.]          *[ Strumigenys fixata misspelled Strumigenys fixate.]",

We used abundance (proportional trap incidence) of overall ants, native ants, invasive ants, & Anoplolepis gracilipes (a globally notorious invasive ant of possible South Asian origin), & rarefied richness as the response variables.  We found that native ant abundance was greater & A. gracilipes abundance was less in less-urbanized landscape, compared to moderately-urbanized & highly-urbanized landscape.  The richness of ants & abundance of overall & invasive ants were unaffected by the urbanization.  We also found that none of the measured environmental gradients influenced abundance, but habitat diversity influenced abundance of overall ants, native ants, overall invasive ants, & richness of ants.  However, A. gracilipes abundance was negatively correlated with habitat diversity.  Ant species composition of less-urbanized landscape was distinct from that of higher urbanization levels.  The richness & abundance of native ants & abundance of non-A. gracilipes invasive ants decreased with the abundance of A. gracilipes.  Because the forest islets of all 3 urbanization levels supported similar richness of native ants, the urbanization seems not to have an adverse effect for the native ants of native forest islets.

We explored diversity, community, and abundance of overall and different functional groups of litter ants, including Anoplolepis gracilipes \u0013 an invasive ant \u0013 on paired SG-neighbouring home garden (HG) sites in rural and urban landscape to (a) assess the quality of SGs and (b) examine whether the variation in ant community of the two habitats was predicted by urbanization and abundance of A. gracilipes. We considered species and local contribution to ≤-diversity to identify species and sites crucial for conservation of sites. Abundance and richness of overall ants, proportional trap incidence of species, and abundance of A. gracilipes were similar on SG and HG, but species diversity and abundance of certain ant functional groups were higher on SG. Ant community of SG was different from HG, but was not affected by urbanization. A. gracilipes and rural SGs contributed the most to ≤ diversity. A. gracilipes gave little pressure on native ant community. The study concludes that SGs, despite invaded by A. gracilipes, have potential for conserving biodiversity.",

Therefore, in this study, we explored the association of Wolbachia with Formicidae in an evolutionary context. Our data suggest that supergroup F is the ancestral character state for Wolbachia infection in ants, and there is only one transition to supergroup A, and once ants acquired infection with supergroup A, there have been no other strains introduced. Our data also reveal that the origin of Wolbachia in ants likely originated in Asia and spread to the Americas, and then back to Asia. Understanding the processes and mechanisms of dispersion of these bacteria in Formicidae is a crucial step to advance the knowledge of this symbiosis and their implications in an evolutionary context.          *[Anoplolepis gracilipes misspelled Anoplolepis gracillipes.]",

In one population related to Diacamma ceylonense from India, Diacamma sp. from Nilgiri (hereafter referred to as 'nilgiri'), gamergates do not mutilate their nestmates & yet maintain reproductive monopoly.  To understand what triggers mutilation, we exchanged cocoons between the mutilating D. ceylonense colonies & the non mutilating 'nilgiri' colonies.  'nilgiri' callows were not mutilated even in D. ceylonense colonies, while D. ceylonense callows were mutilated even in 'nilgiri' colonies, suggesting that the cues for mutilation originate in the victims (callows), presumably in the gemmae themselves.

    "abstract": "Batesian mimics typically dupe visual predators by resembling noxious or deadly model species. Ants are unpalatable and dangerous to many arthropod taxa, and are popular invertebrate models in mimicry studies. Ant mimicry by spiders, especially jumping spiders, has been studied and researchers have examined whether visual predators can distinguish between the ant model, spider mimic and spider non\u0010mimics. Tropical habitats harbour a diverse community of ants, their mimics and predators. In one such tripartite mimicry system, we investigated the response of an invertebrate visual predator, the ant\u0010mimicking praying mantis (Euantissa pulchra), to two related ant\u0010mimicking spider prey of the genus Myrmarachne, each closely mimicking its model ant species. We found that weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) were much more aggressive than carpenter ants (Camponotus sericeus) towards the mantis. Additionally, mantids exhibited the same aversive response towards ants and their mimics. More importantly, mantids approached carpenter ant\u0010mimicking spiders significantly more than often that they approached weaver ant\u0010mimicking spiders. Thus, in this study, we show that an invertebrate predator, the praying mantis, can indeed discriminate between two closely related mimetic prey. The exact mechanism of the discrimination remains to be tested, but it is likely to depend on the level of mimetic accuracy by the spiders and on the aggressiveness of the ant model organism.",

We collected 62 ant species, in 26 genera & 6 subfamilies, Myrmicinae was the most  commly collected.  In order to ascertain survey efficiency, we calculated the richness by mean ACE, Jacknife 1, & Michaelis Menten Mean estimators, which indicated that the surveyed ants were 62 to 88% of the total number of species in both agroecosystems.  Richness, diversity, & exclusive ant species were 38, 1.33, & 23 for the forest fragment; 35, 1.08, & 10 for the Prosopis silvopastoral system; & 21, 0.92, & 7 for the Leucaena silvopastoral system.  With a Hutchenson \"t\" test we found differences in ant diversity values between all ecosystems (p less than 0.05).

    "abstract": "The fig-fig wasp system of Ficus racemosa constitutes an assemblage of galler and parasitoid wasps in which tritrophic interactions occur. Since predatory ants (Oecophylla smaragdina and Technomyrmex albipes) or mostly trophobiont-tending ants (Myrmicaria brunnea) were previously shown to differentially use volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from figs as proximal cues for predation on fig wasps, we examined the response of these ants to the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of the wasps. CHC signatures of gallers were distinguished from those of parasitoids by the methyl-branched alkanes 5-methylpentacosane and 13-methylnonacosane which characterised trophic group membership. CHC profiles of wasp predator and wasp prey were congruent suggesting that parasitoids acquire CHCs from their prey; the CHC composition of the parasitoid Apocrypta sp 2 clustered with that of its galler host Apocryptophagus fusca, while the CHC profile of the parasitoid Apocryptophagus agraensis clustered with its galler prey, the fig pollinator Ceratosolen fusciceps. In behavioural assays with ants, parasitoid CHC extracts evoked greater response in all ant species compared to galler extracts, suggesting that parasitoid CHC extracts contain more elicitors of ant behaviour than those of plant feeders. CHCs of some wasp species did not elicit significant responses even in predatory ants, suggesting chemical camouflage. Contrary to earlier studies which demonstrated that predatory ants learned to associate wasp prey with specific fig VOCs, prior exposure to fig wasp CHCs did not affect the reaction of any ant species to these CHCs.",

Incorporation of new nesting trees in the central territory reached a major peak in September & a smaller peak during March-April.  In each colony, only one tree, located near the centre of the territory, was used continuously for a maximum duration (28 & 30 months in colony I & II respectively).  In both the colonies, trees located at a distant from the center of the colony territory were found to be incorporated in the central territory, during March-April and/or September each year. Ground area used by each colony was largest during September.  The circannual rhythm of territorial organization may be related to the brood development & food requirements of the Oecophylla smaragdina colony.  Thus, territorial expansion during September, each year, may be a fine-tuned evolutionary adaptation of the growing colony to the availability of insect prey during the SW monsoon rains.]",

During roving survey in 42 locations in Tamil Nadu & one in Kerala, India for the occurrence of pests, observations were made on the ants visiting Jatropha & feeding on nectar & other insects, & spreading insect pests (specifically coccids).  Nine species of ants (Camponotus compressus (Fabricius), Camponotus sericeus (Fabricius), Camponotus parius Emery, Crematogaster sp., Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius), Pheidole spathifera Forel, Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius), Monomorium sp., & Tapinoma melanocephalus Fabricius)) were visiting Jatropha.  The species composition & predominance of particular species varied with location.  Due to its characteristic behavior exhibiting strong territorial defense & aggression, O. smaragdina prevented/repelled the approach of the Jatropha visitors including the pollinators.  Other species visited flowers & coccid infested parts to collect nectar & honeydew secretions respectively.  The positive effects of the ants are that they remove herbivorous insects like shoot webber & defoliating caterpillars & aiding in incidental pollination while collecting nectar.  Pollen grains were observed on ventral side of Camponotus spp., & on both ventral & dorsal sides of Crematogaster sp., S. geminata, & P. spathifer.  Ants visit mostly confined to the flowers of the same plant, thus the possibility of effecting cross pollination is very remote.  However, they aid in pollination within the same plant.  Jatropha is affected by coccid pests like tailed mealy bugs Ferrisiana (Ferrisia) virgata, C., Jatropha Scale, Hemilecanium imbricans N., & neem Scale, Pulvinaria maxima G. & recently by the invasive papaya mealy bug Paracoccus marginatus Williams & Granara de Willink.  The negative effect was more pronounced especially when a mealy bug infestation is present, as they often care for fluid-sucking homopterans that damage the plants & indirectly cause sooty mould.]",

Abamectin acted significantly faster than either dechlorane or sulfluramid.  When workers fed upon 500-ppm baits, abamectin killed the ants faster (LT50 [95% CL] = 1.06[0.88-1.23] d) than either dechlorane (5.82 [5.62-6.00] d) or sulfluramid (6.20 [5.76-6.65] d).  All toxicants were readily transferred by trophallaxis.  In ants that were exposed to a single forager that had fed upon a 500-ppm bait, abamectin caused death more rapidly (LT50 [95% CL] = 2.56 [2.29-2.81] d) than did dechlorane (6.71 [6.35-7.05] d) or sulfluramid (6.96 [6.06-8.42] d).  In both direct and indirect exposures, significant concentration-dependent time delays before mortality were observed for all toxins.  Based on the effective lethal time for 90% (ELT90) of the exposed workers, the concentration dependence of the time delays for dechlorane and sulfluramid were equivalent, and both were active over a wider range of concentrations than abamectin.

    "abstract": "*[The mandibular gland of ants releases chemical compounds with functions ranging from nestmate alarm & nestmate recognition to antimicrobial defense.  While the morphology of this ethologically important gland is well investigated in several species, the mechanism of secretion release in ants is not explicitly addressed to date.  To clarify this question, we examined the anatomy of the gland orifice in ant species from 14 different subfamilies employing different techniques.  The orifice close to the mandibular base is located on an area called mandalus.  Our investigations revealed variation in mandalar shape, with clear trends in different subfamilies.  In contrast, the internal organization is remarkably congruent across all investigated species.  The thin external mandalar cuticle is always connected to the mandibular gland duct by a cuticular lamella, visible as a characteristic anchor-shaped structure in cross section.  The slit-like gland orifice at the distal end of the mandalus is usually crescent-shaped.  In some ant species with specialized mandibles such as trap-jaws, the organization of the orifice area is adapted to the mandibular shape, but always retains the general internal organization.  No muscles were found in association with the orifice, nor with any other part of the mandibular gland.  However, the base of the mandalus is connected to the prepharyngeal sucking pump by a cuticular ligament.  Additionally, it is continuous with the conjunctiva connecting the mandible to the head capsule.  We propose that retraction of the sucking pump by the muscle M. tentoriobuccalis, potentially in concert with opening of the mandible, stretches out the ligament & thus pulls on the mandalus & mandalar lamella to open the gland orifice, & allow for secretion release.  This hypothesis is congruent with findings on other aculeate Hymenoptera.         *[Cryptopone taivanae misspelled Crypotopone taivanae; Eciton misspelled Echiton.]",

    "abstract": "Cashew nut trees are consistently ant-visited throughout the year, with the ants attracted to a large number of extrafloral nectaries on the leaves, inflorescences, flowers, and developing nuts. The commercial production of cashew nut, for example, in India, Brazil, and east Africa, consistently applies pesticides, especially insecticides, in large monoculture plantings. Each year prophylactic spraying begins with the first flush of new leaves, continues through flowering, ending at about mid-nut development. We surveyed for ant diversity in sprayed and unsprayed cashew monocultures of various sizes and ages in Sri Lanka, India, and Malaysia to document the ant-cashew relationship and to explore the potential of ants replacing chemical pesticides in insect control. Using for-profit, commercial-size plantations as examples, we present information that cashew has a strong potential for arthropod-dependent protection from pests and suggest important habitat considerations for encouraging ants within cashew plantings.          *[Pheidole misspelled Pleidole.

Twelve layers of sand, each 1 by 1 m in horizontal extent by 10 cm in thickness were emplaced to a depth of 2 m followed by implantation at the surface of a Florida harvester ant (Pogonomymrex badius) colony (the lower two layers were 50 cm thick). The colony excavated a nest, and after 7 months, the sand layers were excavated to the base to test the hypothesis that sand grains were moved upward within the ant nest without reaching the surface. The ants penetrated 11 of the 12 colored layers reaching a depth of 130 cm. Thirty nine sticky-acetate peels of ant chamber floors were collected and colored sand grains were counted under a microscope. More than 16,000 grains were identified in layers that did not originally host them. Of these, more than 80% were unambiguously moved upward. This means that possibly as many as 54,000 upwardly mobile grains were present (ratio of 3:1 uncolored to colored). In relation to optical luminescence (OSL) dating, this means that grains that would not have been optically zeroed by transport to the surface (defined here as subterranean-transported) were present in abundance, and that if the site was ancient, there would have been found many grains that were older than the layers they presently reside in, even if only one colony of harvester ants had disturbed the layers. This is in addition to the fact that backfilling of chambers and tunnels may contribute even more significantly to the presence of a subterranean-transported component of an OSL sample. We conclude that ants can significantly affect the age distributions in sandy archaeological sites. Multiple examples of such disturbances have been documented in the literature. Most relevant to our results are recent studies of the OSL chronology of Pre-Clovis-age and Palaeoindian age archaeological sites in sandy environments in North America that may have been compromised by ant bioturbation of quartz sand grains. Here we have examined in detail the potential effects of one episode of ant nest-building on the age overestimation of affected sediments. From this we found that as few as 12 episodes of bioturbation involving backfilling of chambers in the same volume of sand could lead to the presence of 1 contaminant grain per 50 grains of sample.

    "abstract": "Ant nest beetles (Paussus L.) are ecologically fascinating and phenotypically bizarre. Obligate myrmecophiles, Paussus have undergone extreme adaptations for life with ants and their profound range of phenotypic diversity has been difficult to reconcile in a systematic framework. We conducted a detailed morphological study of Paussus utilizing novel techniques and character systems in order to discover anatomical apomorphies diagnostic of the major clades of Paussus strongly supported by molecular data. Bayesian inference (BI) of molecules alone, morphology alone and varying combinations of the two data types reveal that morphology is informative for placing Paussus species, despite the extreme phenotypic diversity and convergence prevalent in the group. We propose a new classification for Paussus based on this phylogeny. The genus Paussus is revised to include all genera, subgenera and species formerly classified as Paussus by Nagel (2003) in addition to Hylopaussus syn.n., Hylotorus syn.n. and Granulopaussus syn.n. The following species are transferred to Paussus: Paussus sebakuanus (PÈringuey) comb.n., Paussus gracilis (Reichensperger) comb.n., Paussus bucephalus Gyllenhal, Paussus caroli (Reichensperger) comb.n., Paussus uelensis (Reichensperger) comb.n., Paussus hottentottus (Westwood) comb.n., Paussus blanchardi (Raffray) comb.n., Paussus basilewskyi (Luna de Carvalho) comb.n., Paussus granulatus Westwood, Paussus sankuruensis Reichensperger, Paussus leleupi (Reichensperger) comb.n., Paussus reichenspergeri (Luna de Carvalho) comb.n. We formally delineate and diagnose the following major subgroups of Paussus: Paussus I series, comprising the subgenera Bohemanipaussus Luna de Carvalho stat. rev. sensu n., Bathypaussus Wasmann stat. rev. sensu n., and Edaphopaussus Kolbe stat. rev. sensu n.; the Paussus II series comprising the subgenera Paussus L. stat. rev. sensu n., Klugipaussus Kolbe stat. rev. sensu n., Scaphipaussus Fowler stat. rev. sensu n., Hylotorus Dalman stat.n. sensu n., and Anapaussus Wasmann stat. rev. sensu n.; and the Paussus III series comprising the subgenera Lineatopaussus Kolbe stat. rev. sensu n. and Shuckardipaussus Kolbe stat. rev. sensu n.",

Many of these cases, appear to have a common cause, the stings of a small red ant, Wasmannia auropunctata (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), originally from the Neotropics, but spread to other parts of the world through human commerce. The purpose of this article is to link disparate literature on punctate or nummular corneal lesions published in medical, veterinary, wildlife, and entomology journals, because many researchers seem largely unaware of the literature from disciplines other than their own. Recognizing a common cause of this corneal condition is important to insure proper medical treatment and foster efforts to limit the spread and negative impact of W. auropunctata.",

    "abstract": "In the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and carpenter ant (Camponotus floridanus) the antennal lobe output is connected to higher brain centers by a dual olfactory pathway. Two major sets of uniglomerular projection neurons innervate glomeruli from two antennal-lobe hemispheres and project via a medial and a lateral antennal-lobe protocerebral tract in opposite sequence to the mushroom bodies and lateral horn. Comparison across insects suggests that the lateral projection neuron tract represents a special feature of Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that this promotes advanced olfactory processing associated with chemical communication, orientation and social interactions. To test whether a dual olfactory pathway is restricted to social Hymenoptera, we labeled the antennal lobe output tracts in selected species using fluorescent tracing and confocal imaging. Our results show that a dual pathway from the antennal lobe to the mushroom bodies is present in social bees, basal and advanced ants, solitary wasps, and in one of two investigated species of sawflies. This indicates that a dual olfactory pathway is not restricted to social species and may have evolved in basal Hymenoptera. We suggest that associated advances in olfactory processing represent a preadaptation for life styles with high demands on olfactory discrimination like parasitoism, central place foraging, and sociality.",

Models developed were highly predictive of the species overall range, including both the native distributional area & invaded areas worldwide.  Despite its already widespread occurrence, L. humile has potential for further spread, with tropical coastal Africa & southeast Asia apparently vulnerable to invasion.  Projecting ecological niche models onto 4 general circulation model scenarios of future (2050's) climates provided scenarios of the species potential for distributional expansion with warming climates.

    "abstract": "For nearly 100 million years, the India subcontinent drifted from Gondwana until its collision with Asia some 50 Ma, during which time the landmass presumably evolved a highly endemic biota. Recent excavations of rich outcrops of 50-52-million-year-old amber with diverse inclusions from the Cambay Shale of Gujarat, western India address this issue. Cambay amber occurs in lignitic and muddy sediments concentrated by near-shore chenier systems; its chemistry and the anatomy of associated fossil wood indicates a definitive source of Dipterocarpaceae. The amber is very partially polymerized and readily dissolves in organic solvents, thus allowing extraction of whole insects whose cuticle retains microscopic fidelity. Fourteen orders and more than 55 families and 100 species of arthropod inclusions have been discovered thus far, which have affinities to taxa from the Eocene of northern Europe, to the Recent of Australasia, and the Miocene to Recent of tropical America. Thus, India just prior to or immediately following contact shows little biological insularity. A significant diversity of eusocial insects are fossilized, including corbiculate bees, rhinotermitid termites, and modern subfamilies of ants (Formicidae), groups that apparently radiated during the contemporaneous Early Eocene Climatic Optimum or just prior to it during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Cambay amber preserves a uniquely diverse and early biota of a modern-type of broad-leaf tropical forest, revealing 50 Ma of stasis and change in biological communities of the dipterocarp primary forests that dominate southeastern Asia today.           **[Apparently do not distinguish between Myrmecinae & Myrmicinae (or mispell Myrmicinae).

Ant abundance and species richness peaked at mid-elevations influenced by the presence of favourable physical conditions and abundance of prey resources. Dominance of ants preferring termites and Collembola as prey at sites rich in their specific prey resources indicate the influence of local prey resource availability in determining ant distribution. Dominant species (Tapinoma sp. and Solenopsis sp.) had wider distributions, being present at all elevations. Physical factors (slope of the terrain, rainfall, moisture, humidity, temperature) and prey resource availability (insect larvae, termites, Collembola) influenced ant species abundance at a regional scale, whereas at local scales, site specific variations in the relationship between abundance of ants and prey-predators and physical factors were recorded. The present study highlights the need to consider site-specific abiotic and biotic factors while examining the distribution patterns of litter ants along altitudinal gradients in other regions of the Western Ghats, which is a recognised hot spot of biodiversity with wide regional variation in vegetation types and faunal distribution patterns.          **Myrmicinae incorrectly labeled Myrmecinae; Pheidole misspelled Phidole.",

This is the first report of Proceratium & Zasphinctus from peninsular India & the first record of Vollenhovia from the Western Ghats mountain range proper.  Proceratium gibbosum sp.nov. is described from Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala, being the first record of the P. stictum species group from the Indian subcontinent; it differs from other members of the P. stictum group by the mesonotum bearing a prominent rounded dorsal hump (tumulus) & petiole devoid of ventral tooth.  The first record of the genus Zasphinctus Wheeler, 1918 from the Indian region is presented here, with a description of a new species.  Zasphinctus sahyadriensis sp.nov. differs from all known Afrotropical & Asian Zasphinctus by a combination of characters including clypeal area with single median tooth, occipital margin being regular in outline, & head sculpture sparsely punctate.  The occurrence of the genus Vollenhovia Mayr, 1865 is confirmed from peninsular India, with the description of the female castes of Vollenhovia keralensis sp.nov.  We provide ecological notes on these new taxa.  In addition, separate identification keys based on the worker caste are also presented to Indo-Malayan species of Proceratium, Afrotropical-Indomalayan species of Zasphinctus, & Vollenhovia of the Indian subcontinent.  The biogeographical implications of the presence of these 3 genera are also discussed in relation to plate tectonics of the Indian subcontinent.]          *[Other species that were found in the same microhabitat of P. gibbosum were Tyrannomyrmex alii Sadasivan & Kripakaran,  2017, Protanilla sp., Discothyrea sp., & Recurvidris sp.]          *[ In captivity, Zasphinctus sahyadriensis workers accepted brood of a Pheidole species as food.]          *[Vollenhovia keralensis is described from workers, gynes, & males.]",

A total of 22 species in 13 genera distributed in 5 subfamilies were collected.  These include 3 newly recorded species: Lepisiota frauenfeldi (Mayr) (Formicinae), Crematogaster (Acrocoelia) hodgsoni Forel (Myrmicinae), & Brachyponera nigrita Emery (Ponerinae) for the state & nearly 90.5% of the reported species are new for the district.  Analysis of their zoogeographical distribution reveals that the fauna apart from being Oriental also includes some Palaearctic (72.73%), Australian (13.63%), & Ethiopian (4.54%) elements.  The dominant functional group is constituted by the Subordinate Camponotini (36.37%) followed by Generalized Myrmicinae (22.73%), Tropical Climate Specialist (13.63%), Specialist Predator (9.09%), Opportunist (9.09%), & Dominant Dolichorinae (9.09%).  Ants are mostly prevalent during Monsoon (81.82%), followed by Postmonsoon (68.18%) & Premonsoon (50.00%).  Camponotus (Tanaemyrmex) compressus (Fabricius) & Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius) are recorded throughout the year.  Ranking sequence of the most abundant species (in descending order) is: Camponotus (T.) compressus (15.01%) = Oecophylla smaragdina (15.01%) then Crematogaster (A.) hodgsoni (12.91%).   Camponotus (T.) compressus & Oecophylla smaragdina are the most dominant species.  Data also reveals that both core & buffer zones conjointly offer a better combination of habitat requirement, as 12 species are common in both the zones.  The highest number of species are recorded from leaf litter & ground combined together (22 species) & 6 species are arboreal in nature.  Shannon's Diversity Index (alpha diversity) & Simpson's Diversity Index both are higher in buffer zone.  This reflects the habitat exploitation efficiency of the encountered species.

Species of Myrmarachne encountered are M. plataleoides O. P. Cambridge, M. maratha Tikader and M. orientales Tikader.  It is supposed that chemical or Wasmannian mimicry enables species with ant-like pheromones to live in close contact with ants.  The members of spider Myrmarachne that resemble the aggresive weaver ant Oceophylla smaragdina, with which they live in close contact, also show chemical resemblance.  Further, by mimicking the ants they gain protection from predators.  Since weaver ants have a painful bite & also taste bad, this strategy appears to be successful.  Though these spiders mimic the weaver ants very well, they are known to stay away from them.  They weave a thin web on the leaves, hide under their webbing & ambush their prey.  This communication discusses the morphological & structural similarities between the mimics & their models.  This is the first report of mimicry from this part of the country.]",

Both the species flower and set their seed primarily from August to December. The study of pollen--pistil interaction indicated the existence of morphological protandry in both species, and pollen germination occurred only after rupture of the stigmatic surface. This suggests that some form of self-incompatibility operates in these species. Ants were the common vectors tripping the stigma and transporting some foreign pollen. Campylomma verbasci (large black ants) were only seen on the flowers of C. virosa, while Monomorium minimum (small black ants) were restricted to the flowers of C. gladiata. Inadequacy of reliable pollinators and high rate of bud/flower drop may be the main factors for low fruit and seed set in both the species.    NOTE: Peng & Christian 2008 indicated that Campylomma is a genus of bugs, Hemiptera: Miridae.          *[Small black ants (Monomorium  minimum) & big black ants (Campylomma verbasci) were the frequent visitors for C. gladiata & C. virosa, respectively, & mainly behaved as primary nectar robbers.

    "abstract": "Social insects live together in groups and maintain cohesion to enhance their chances of survival and productivity. Colony cohesion is severely challenged during relocation. We examined the dynamics of colony reunification and the factors affecting nest choice of artificially fragmented colonies of the queenless ant Diacamma indicum. None of the twelve undisturbed colonies fragmented or relocated when a good nest was available in their neighbourhood. When colonies were artificially fragmented, they mostly (25/30) reunified into a single nest unlike in randomized time-ordered network models, indicating that reunification is not the result of random recruitment acts. When the reproductive individual was present in a good nest, the colonies reunified at this address. However, when she was present in a suboptimal nest, colonies relocated her to a better quality nest and reunified there, illustrating that quality of the new nest is more important. The work distribution and relocation dynamics of reunification were comparable to intact colonies relocating to a single new nest. This is made possible by enhanced exchange of information among tandem leaders in the form of increased number of tandem runs among them. We conclude that colony cohesion is very important and is maintained after incorporating the risks of relocation and preference for nest quality during decision making.",

Our main goal is to serve as a reference to the various research initiatives currently being done in the country.  We found 2,124 ant records of 679 ant species from 180 localities reported in 149 articles.  We used a subset of this database (i.e. 1,125 records left after removal of duplicates & records with no locality information) to review the Ecuadorian regions, provinces, & national parks covered by the list.  For a tropical country, both the number of records per ant species (mean=1.8, SD=1.9) & the number of ant species per locality (mean=6.2, SD=29.7) are extremely low.  Moreover, the ant records in our list are biased towards 3 provinces (Orellana, 410 ant records & 378 ant spp.; Sucumbios, 212 & 177; Pichincha, 129 & 92), one region (Oriente, 779 records & 487 ant species) & non-protected areas (777 ant records & 510 ant spp.).  Endemic ants are poorly covered by the Ecuadorian system of protected areas.]",

    "abstract": "*[Ninety Camponotus pennsylvanicus ant colonies were collected throughout 9 Indiana & 4 surrounding state counties.  Molecular characterization included Illumina high throughput sequencing of 2 mtDNA genes (CO1 & CO2) & 2 rDNA loci (ITS1 & ITS2) within 40 colonies & scoring 6 microsatellite loci within 90 colonies on a Sanger sequencer.  Maximum likelihood analysis of both trees revealed no discernable population structure or gene flow.  Illumina & microsatellite scored datasets combined to generate a consensus tree with higher bootstrap support, but failed to reveal nested spatial clustering.  These 3 analyses provide strong evidence that black carpenter ant population range extends throughout the entirety of the Midwest.  Conspecific outgroups were always recovered together, however maximum likelihood analysis failed to cluster together outgroup specimens in all 3 analyses.  Black carpenter ant intercolony aggression was examined to reveal any support for significantly increased or decreased aggression in correlation with conspecific genetic or geographic distance.  Fifteen colonies were collected & subjected to paired nestmate discrimination assay trials.  A Mantel test determined genetic & geographic distance factors do not share collinearity & thus these variables were included as fixed effects in model analyses.  Data obtained utilizing the 1-4 integer scale included maximum aggression score, relative aggression level proportion per trial, & aggression interaction index.  These varied forms of data were examined for any correlation of aggression to genetic or spatial distance within ANOVA, cumulative link mixed model, linear mixed-effect model, & generalized linear mixed model analyses.  ANOVA results revealed significant differences of mean aggression proportion expressed as well as significantly different mean aggression proportion received.  None of the 3 model analyses found any significant relationship between aggression & genetic or geographic distance.  Intercolony crossings nearly always revealed some form of aggression, confirming standard dyad field assays are effective ways to delineate colony relationships.]",

Surveying localized ant composition within natural, semi-natural, & urban habitat supported efforts to determine whether T. sessile appear to be primary (drivers) threats as instigators or secondary (passengers) threats as inheritors of indigenous ant decline.  Sampling 180 sites, evenly split between all habitats with & without T. sessile present, yielded 45 total species.  Although urbanization & T. sessile presence factors were significantly linked to ant decline, their interaction correlated to the greatest reduction of total ant richness (74%) & abundance (81%).  Total richness appeared to decrease from 27 species to 18 when natural habitat is urbanized & from 18 species to 7 with T. sessile present in urban plots.  Odorous house ant presence minimally influenced ant communities within natural & semi-natural habitat, highlighting the importance of habitat alteration & T. sessile presence interactions.  Results suggest urbanization releases T. sessile from unknown constraints by decreasing ant richness & competition.  Within urban environment, T. sessile are pre-adapted to quickly exploit new resources & grow to supercolony strength, wherein T. sessile drive adjacent biodiversity loss.  Odorous house ants act as passengers & drivers of ecological change throughout different phases of urban 'invasion'.]",

Acetobacteraceae family has been divided into ten genera but, only three of them include nitrogen fixing species: Gluconacetobacter, Acetobacter, and Swaminathania. This article originated from our study primarily aimed to isolate new endosymbiotic nitrogen fixer among Acetobacteraceae during which we have isolated, for the first time in India, four different strains of Asaia sp. from three different sources: Michalia champaca flower, Anopheles mosquito, and ant Tetraponera rufonigra. All the endosymbiotic strains isolated possess the ability to fix nitrogen. Evidence for both nitrogenase activity and the presence of nifH gene in isolated Asaia sp. is presented. Asaia bogorensis (MTCC 4041T) and A. siamensis (MTCC 4042T), two of the validated type strains available from the repository, were tested positive for the presence of functional nitrogenase. The nifH gene sequences from these type strains were also confirmed and compared with other nitrogen fixing members of the family Acetobacteraceae. Our result corroborate with the previous reports that Asaia sp. are indeed widely distributed in nature but this is the first time demonstration of their functional nitrogenase activity. This study shows Asaia sp. as fourth genera of nitrogen fixing bacteria in the family Acetobacteraceae.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of ant-plant mutualistic associations are known to occur in terrestrial ecosystems. Although many species of plants recruit ants to obtain protection from herbivores, myrmecophily is rare, since only few plant species are known to be adapted for pollination predominantly by ants. The annual herb, Euphorbia hirta, is characterized by the \u0018ant-pollination syndrome\u0019 including traits such as unisexual flowers, inconspicuous cyathia clustered in globose cymes, inflorescence-associated tiny nectaries and short, semi-erect stem. In present study, we aimed to examine the pollination ecology of Euphorbia hirta and the role of ants in its pollination. Field and laboratory experiments conducted to understand the association between E. hirta plants and ants revealed that seven ant species (belonging to five genera and three subfamilies) visited E. hirta plants. The visitation patterns of ants revealed that in a single foraging trip the ants visited a number of plants indicating their potential role in cross-pollination. Field-based exclusion experiments revealed production of significantly higher number of fruits in E. hirta plants under open pollination treatment as compared to other treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the adherence of the pollen grains to the bristles located on ant mouth-parts was facilitated by the three vertical, semi-circular grooves present on the grain surface. The number of fruits produced per plant was higher in ant-included plants as compared to only winged insect-pollinated and only self-pollinated plants suggesting that the plant-visiting ants are successful pollination vectors of E. hirta and while promoting self-pollination also contribute towards cross-pollination services.",

    "abstract": "The net effect of multitrophic interactions among members (belonging to various feeding guilds such as herbivores, predators) of arboreal arthropod assemblages on the host plants may be enhancement in herbivory or in protection of the plants. Many species of ants are arboreal foragers on extrafloral-nectary (EFN)-bearing and/or harboring honeydew producing hemipterans. The present study reports the consequence of multispecies interactions among ants, ant-tended aphids, other insect herbivores and predators on the fitness of an EFN-bearing plant, Clerodendrum infortunatum. By manipulating the presence of ants and arthropod predators on the plants, ant presence was found to increase aphid abundance but reduced the abundance of three species of insect herbivores and two species of arthropod predators on the plants. The plants' fitness (number of flowers/buds and fruits) was significantly higher in the presence of ants irrespective of the presence or absence of arthropod predators. The fitness of the plants was significantly low when both the ants as well as the arthropod predators were excluded from the plants. We suggest that the presence of aggressive ant bodyguards on the plants accounts for the reduced occurrence of other damage-causing insect herbivores, resulting in a net positive impact on the plant fitness. Our study suggests that the fitness gains of the EFN-bearing plants arise due to the facultative association between the sugar-loving, ant species and EFN-bearing plants and multitrophic interactions among the aphid-tending ants, diverse insect herbivores and the arthropod predators attracted to the plants due to the presence of potential aphid prey.",

    "abstract": "Several species of ants are common in cities and are therefore included in studies of urban ecology. Here, I describe and categorize some aspects of the available literature on urban ants to better understand what has been studied and what is known by mapping well-studied areas and important gaps. Through systematic review techniques, I identified 109 relevant studies in the literature, and most (37.96 % of the publications) investigated the ecology and biodiversity of these ants followed by studies that addressed invasive ants (30.56 %), the control of pest ants (19.44 %) and public health (pathogen vector ants) (12.04 %). The studies that addressed invasive ants and pest ant control tended to focus on exotic species and their ecology, and the most tested type of control was the use of chemical pesticides. The most frequently used species for these tests was Linepithema humile, which was also the most studied invasive species. I identified a scarcity of studies in highly urbanized cities in countries located in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, Central America and South America with the exception of Brazil. I suggest that those topics that have not been studied in the literature, such as the influence of air pollution on ant fauna and the explicit recommendations for the handling and conservation of native species in urban green areas, be placed on the agenda of the scientific community as points of concern.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to provide a detailed taxonomic resource for identifying and studying ants in the genus Pheidole that have established beyond their native ranges. There is an increasing need for systematists to study taxa of specific concern to 21‚W century environmental, food security and public health challenges. Systematics has an important role to play in both the theoretical and applied disciplines of invasion biology. Few invaders impact terrestrial ecosystems more than ants. Among the world\u0019s 100 worst invasive species is the cosmopolitan and highly destructive Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius). Accurate identification of Pheidole megacephala is imperative for the success of screening, management and eradication programs designed to protect native ecosystems from the impacts of this destructive species. However, accurate identification of Pheidole species is difficult because of their taxonomic diversity, dimorphic worker caste and lack of taxonomic resources. Illustrated keys are included, along with the taxonomic history, taxonomic diagnoses, biological notes and risk statements for the 14 most invasive members of the genus. Global distribution maps based on over 14,000 specimen and literature records are presented for each species. These results of this work will facilitate identification of pest species, determination of climatic and habitat requirements, discovery of pest origins, horizon scanning and assessment of invasion pathways. The following new synonym is proposed, with the senior synonym listed first and the junior synonyms in parentheses: Pheidole indica Mayr (= Pheidole teneriffana Forel, and its synonyms Pheidole taina Aguayo and Pheidole voeltzkowii Forel). Pheidole navigans Forel, stat. rev., stat. n. is removed from synonymy and elevated to species rank. It is proposed that records of Pheidole moerens Forel outside of the Mesoamerica and the Caribbean refer instead to Pheidole navigans or other heterospecific taxa in the Pheidole flavens species complex. We propose that the names Pheidole anastasii Emery and Pheidole floridana Emery have been widely misapplied to North American outdoor records of Pheidole bilimeki Mayr. It is suggested that the synonymy of Pheidole lauta Wheeler be transferred from Pheidole floridana Emery to Pheidole bilimeki Mayr.",

    "abstract": "Three liquid insecticide formulations were evaluated as barrier treatments against perimeter-invading ants at a multifamily housing complex in West Lafayette, IN.  Several ant species were present at the study site, including (in order of abundance) pavement ant, Tetramorium caespitum (L.); honey ant, Prenolepis imparis (Say); odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say); thief ant, Solenopsis molesta (Say); acrobat ant, Crematogaster ashmeadi (Mayr); crazy ant, Paratrechina longicornis (Latrielle), field ants, Formica spp.; and carpenter ant Camponotus pennsylvanicus (DeGeer). Studies began in May 2001 and concluded 8 wk later in July. Individual replicate treatments were placed 0.61 m (2 feet) up and 0.92 m (3 feet) out from the ends of 46.1 by 10.1-m (151 by 33-foot) apartment buildings. Ant sampling was performed with 10 placements of moist cat food for 1 h within treatment zones, followed by capture and removal of recruited ants for later counting. All treatments led to substantial reductions in ant numbers relative to untreated controls. The most effective treatment was fipronil, where 2% of before-treatment ant numbers were present at 8 wk after treatment. Both imidacloprid and cyfluthrin barrier treatments had efficacy comparative with fipronil, but to 4 and 2 wk, respectively. Odorous house ants were not sampled before treatment. Comparisons of ant species composition between treatments and controls revealed an increase in odorous house ant frequencies at 1-8 wk after treatment in treated locations only. These results demonstrate efficacy for both nonrepellent and repellent liquid insecticides as perimeter treatments for pest ants. In addition, our findings with odorous house ant highlight an apparent invasive-like characteristic of this species that may contribute to its dramatic increase in structural infestation rates in many areas of the United States.",

Experimental exclusion of ants resulted in an increase in the number of non-pollinating fig wasps on F. condensa & F. racemosa.  Experimental ant supplementation led to a decrease in the number of non-pollinating fig wasps on F. carica.  Moreover, on F. condensa, the level of reduction of the number of parasitic wasps depended on the number & identity of the ants.  On F. carica, non-pollinating fig wasps even avoided trees occupied by the dominant predatory ant.  The consistency of the effect of ants in these 3 cases, representing a geographically, ecologically, & taxonomically broad sample of figs, argues for the generality of the effect we observed.]",

    "abstract": "Weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) are dominant ants in open forests from India, Australia, China and Southeast Asia, whose leaf nests are held together with larval silk. The species, together with its sole congener O. longinoda, has been important in research on biological control, communication, territoriality and colony integration. Over most of the range, only one queen has been found per colony, but the occurrence of several queens per nest has been reported for the Australian Northern Territory. The number of males mating with each queen is little known. Here we report on the colony structure of O. smaragdina using published and new microsatellite markers. Worker genotype arrays reflect the occurrence of habitual polygyny (more than one queen per colony) in 18 colonies from Darwin, Northern Australia, with up to five queens inferred per colony. Monogyny (one queen per colony) with occasional polygyny was inferred for 14 colonies from Queensland, Australia, and 20 colonies from Java, Indonesia. Direct genotyping of the sperm carried by 77 Queensland queens and worker genotypic arrays of established colonies yielded similar results, indicating that less than half of the queens mate only once and some mate up to five times. Worker genotype arrays indicated that queens from Java and the Northern Territory also often mate with more than one male, but less often than those from Queensland. A strong isolation-by-distance effect was found for Queensland samples. The variation uncovered means that O. smaragdina is a more versatile study system than previously supposed.",

    "abstract": "Aim We investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of genetic diversity in West Indian and mainland populations of a widespread parthenogenic ant (Platythyrea punctata F. Smith) to infer source populations and subsequent colonizations across its geographic range.  Location Central America, Texas and the West Indies (Florida, the Bahamas, Greater and Lesser Antilles).  Methods We employed phylogeographic reconstruction based on 1451 bp of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II) sequenced from 91 individuals of P. punctata. We employed standard population genetic analyses, Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, haplotype networks and molecular dating methods as performed by beast. We also employed phylogenetic analysis using two nuclear markers (970 bp) to understand the placement of P. punctata in the globally distributed genus Platythyrea.  Results Based on highly reduced haplotypic variation and temporal estimates, rapid expansion and dispersal from Central America best explains the observed distribution of haplotypes. Platythyrea punctata successfully invaded the West Indies very few times. One haplotype occurred on every island surveyed from the Bahamas and Florida in the north to Barbados at the southern edge of its range. Haplotype diversity in the West Indies is quite low, despite a larger sample size relative to the mainland. Most mainland colonies collected each possessed a unique haplotype, whereas only Florida and the larger islands (the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe) contained more than one haplotype. Island haplotypes were most similar to haplotypes collected in northern Mexico and southern Texas, but genetic distances were nevertheless high. The putative sister species of P. punctata appears to be an endemic of Hispaniola (P. strenua Wheeler & Mann), even though older, mainland populations of P. punctata are sympatric with at least two other congenerics.  Main conclusions Dispersal seems very limited on the mainland, with well-defined clades corresponding to geographical regions. Colonization of the islands from the mainland was extremely rare, but once successful there were very few barriers to expansion to nearly every island in the West Indies. We hypothesize that this invasion occurred during the late Pleistocene as the climate became warmer and less arid.",

We examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of three bacterial endosymbionts (Wolbachia, Arsenophonus, and Rhizobiales) in four Anoplolepis gracilipes (Smith) populations in the Pacific region, four populations from mainland Australia and one population from Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Wolbachia was found in eight of the nine sampling sites, with between 31.8 and 100% of ants infected. These infection rates are substantially higher than those previously observed for other invasive ants such as Linepithema humile and Solenopsis invicta. All sequences of Wolbachia were genetically identical. Arsenophonus was observed in five of the nine sampling sites, with infection rates ranging between 4.5 and 50.8%. Like Wolbachia, Arsenophonus can modify the sex-ratio of its hosts via male-killing. Arsenophonus was found to co-occur with Wolbachia in the same ants in five of the nine sampling sites. Rhizobiales is a clade of symbiotic bacteria mostly found in herbivorous ants. These bacteria help provide nitrogen to their hosts and were found in only three of the nine sampling sites with an infection rate of 1.6-11.8%. It also co-occurred with the other bacteria. There was no genetic variation in Arsenophonus and Rhizobiales samples, with the exception of a sequence from one Arsenophonus sample in Samoa that differed by a single base pair. These bacterial endosymbionts may contribute to the population variability in A. gracilipes and may be manipulated for the purpose of pest management.",

Yet, investigation of 83 worker samples from the whole globe provided evidence that the Ghost Ant consists of 2 species: 8.4 % of the samples belonged to the new species T. pithecorum sp.nov. whereas 91.6 % were classified as T. melanocephalum.  Absence of mixed samples indicates that T. melanocephalum & T. pithecorum sp.nov. do not represent morphs of the same species.  T. pithecorum sp.nov. is known from a greenhouse finding in Germany & outdoor populations from the south of the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, India, Malaysia, & the Fiji & Christmas Islands.  The phenotypical separation of the new species from other minute Tapinoma species of Orientalic, Indo-Australian, & Australasian origin is very clear, allowing identification even by evaluation of z-stack photos.  A detailed argumentation is presented that Tapinoma pellucida (Smith, 1857), T. coronatum (Forel, 1908), T. malesianum (Forel, 1913), T. australis (Santschi, 1928), T. australe (Santschi, 1928), T. luffae (Kurian, 1955), T. wallacei (Guerrero, 2018), & T. jerdoni nom.nov. should be considered as synonyms of T. melanocephalum.  Synomymies of T. melanocephalum & T. pithecorum sp.nov. with T. indicum (Forel, 1895), & Tapinoma minutum (Mayr, 1862) are clearly excluded by morphometric data.  Diagrams of principal component analyses, photos, a key as well as a morphometric table to separate these 4 species are presented.  In a concluding section, is argued that the true number of species related to these 4 species is much larger than presently known & a warning is given regarding careless use of pigmentation characters in ant identification.]",

It is argued that the phylogenetic placement of Cardiocondyla next to the genus Ocymyrmex Emery, 1886 as proposed by Blaimer et al. (2018) is doubtful. The main body of the paper is a species-level taxonomic revision of those six species groups and the one monotypical clade which have their centers of origin in the Oriental and Australasian regions. The fauna of this area comprises 26 species eleven of which are described as new: Cardiocondyla schulzi n.sp., C. argentea n.sp., C. semiargentea n.sp., C. argyrotricha n.sp., C. latifrons n.sp., C. micropila n.sp., C. allonivalis n.sp., C. excavata n.sp., C. goroka n.sp., C. subspina n.sp. and C. sulcata n.sp. Recognized as junior synonyms were: Cardiocondyla tsukuyomi Terayama, 1999 and C. breviscapus Seifert, 2003 of C. minutior Forel, 1899 and C. brevispinosa (Donisthorpe, 1948) of C. paradoxa Emery, 1897. Each confirmed species is characterized by verbal descriptions, 18 numerically recorded phenotypic characters, z-stack images in three viewing positions, the key, a differential diagnosis and, if available, a brief life history. Exploratory and hypothesis-driven data analyses of phenotypic characters support the separation of the cryptic species Cardiocondyla minutior Forel, 1899, C. goa Seifert, 2003 and C. tjibodana Karavajev, 1935, two of which have dispersed as tramp species to the New World. Missing development of postzygotic isolation due to very strong prezygotic barriers is indicated in the closely related species Cardiocondyla latifrons n.sp. and C. micropila n.sp. which produce fertile hybrids in laboratory rearings but apparently do not hybridize in a natural context even if nesting in close neighborhood. The strong prezygotic isolation is supposed to be generated by the prevalence of intranidal mating and the difficulty for a mated heterospecific gyne to become accepted in a foreign colony.",

Two species are described as new, increasing the number of species in the group to 8.  We separate the group into 2 main clades: the C. mauritanica species complex, which is of Oriental & Indo-Australian origin & contains the cryptic species C. mauritanica Forel 1890, C. strigifrons Viehmeyer 1922, C. kagutsuchi Terayama 1999, & C. itsukii sp. nov., & the Australasian & Polynesian C. nuda species complex with the cryptic species C. nuda (Mayr 1866), C. atalanta Forel 1915, C. paranuda Seifert 2003, & C. compressa sp. nov.  The mean error of the 2 NC-clustering methods relative to the controlling linear discriminant analysis was 0.4% in C. mauritanica, 2.2% in C. itsukii, 0% in C. strigifrons, 0% in C. kagutsuchi, 1.5% in C. nuda, 3.2% in C. atalanta, & 3.2% in C. paranuda (all these data are below the 4% threshold recommended by the Pragmatic Species Concept).  The morphologically determined species clusters were confirmed by mtDNA data with a rather strong sequence divergence among the cryptic species of the C. nuda complex of 5.6-7.9%.  The mean mismatch of 2 different mtDNA analyses with NUMOBAT clustering was 5.4% in 54 samples of 7 species of the C. nuda group for which mtDNA data were available.

Quantifying rates of seed predation from elephant dung will facilitate comparisons between elephants and alternative dispersers, helping us understand the functional role of megaherbivores in ecosystems. We conducted an experiment to quantify the predation of Dillenia indica seeds from elephant dung in Buxa Reserve, India from December 2012 to April 2013. Using dung boluses from the same dung pile, we compared the number of seeds in boluses that are a) opened immediately upon detection (control boluses), b) made available only to small seed predators (<3 mm wide) for 1-4 months, and c) made available to all seed predators and secondary dispersers for 1-4 months. Using a model built on this experiment, we estimated that seed predation by small seed predators (most likely ants and termites) destroys between 82.9% and 96.4% of seeds in elephant dung between the time of defecation and the median germination date for D. indica. Exposure to larger seed predators and secondary dispersers did not lead to a significant additional reduction in the number of seeds per dung bolus. Our findings suggest that post-dispersal seed predation by small insects (<3 mm) substantially reduces but does not eliminate the success of elephants as dispersers of D. indica in a tropical moist forest habitat.",

Expansion of agriculture and pesticide are known drivers of declining amphibian populations globally. Yet, several amphibians persist in such temporary wetlands. How amphibians persist in this landscape matrix is not clearly understood. We document amphibian diversity in rice-paddy fields in south India and examine trophic interactions of the two most abundant species. From 60 rice paddy fields, we recorded six species of anurans among which, Minervarya caperata and Microhyla ornata were most abundant. The stomach contents of 57 individuals of the two species were extracted. They consumed prey items belonging to eight orders and 56 taxonomically distinct units dominated by Diptera and Hymenoptera: Formicidae. Although individuals of M. ornata were smaller in body size compared to M. caperata, both species consumed a similar number of arthropods. The dietary niche breadth of M. caperata was wider than M. ornata and the diets of the two species did not overlap greatly. We discuss our findings in the context of prey availability, foraging strategies, and highlight the role of anurans in pest control.",

    "abstract": "Parental care has evolved many times in multiple taxa and, by definition, enhances offspring survivorship. Anurans exhibit a diverse array of parental care behaviors, but studies examining their adaptive significance in an evolutionary context are limited. The critically endangered bush frog, Raorchestes chalazodes (Rhacophoridae), only breeds inside hollow internodes of the endemic bamboo (Ochlandra travancorica) in the southern Western Ghats of India from June through October. From systematic surveys, we established that adult males are sole caregivers exhibiting egg attendance and egg guarding behavior. Predation was the main cause of egg mortality in the absence of an attending male; the majority of predation events were caused by conspecific males. The results highlight the role of regional and microhabitat-specific selection pressures such as strong seasonality, limited resources, and competition for oviposition sites. Oviposition sites are in high demand, but in short supply and by consuming unattended eggs, the conspecific male may benefit from nutritional gains as well as mating opportunities at the oviposition site. Our work lays foundations for further examination of social and reproductive behaviors of anurans not only in the Western Ghats but also in South and Southeast Asia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The bamboo-breeding frog R. chalazodes is one among 62 arboreal frogs of the genus Raorchestes found in the Western Ghats of India. It was presumed extinct until its rediscovery in 2011 from within bamboo internodes endemic to the region. Adult males of this species care for direct developing eggs, laid exclusively inside of hollow bamboo internodes. Conspecific males cannibalized unattended egg clutches when the caregiving adult male was experimentally removed from the oviposition site. Eggs were also eaten by ants, parasitized by flies, and died from fungal infections or drowned. Male parental care in the form of egg attendance and egg guarding prevents predation of eggs and increases offspring survivorship. Parental care behavior is common among several taxa with external fertilization. Integrating natural history with in situ experiments may reveal novel insights into the adaptive nature of parental care behavior.",

The contents were manually separated and examined. Cumulative frequency was used to determine the contribution of food items in the diet of sun bear. Malayan sun bear was observed to feed on a wide variety of food items. Coleoptera were the most frequently occurring food item in their diet. Sun bear consumed 10 plant species. The items/species area curve was developed to find the minimum number of scats required to study the dietary composition. Food of animal origin comprised of the class Arachnida, Insecta, Mammalia and Osteichtyes. Sun bear were also found to feed on 15 families of insects that were mainly from the order Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Isoptera. Among 15 families, 14 insects were identified as regular food items of sun bear in the study area. Presence of rodents and scorpions in food of sun bear was also recorded.

The locomotor activity rhythm of virgin queens entrained to a 24 h (12: 12 h) laboratory light/dark cycle and free-ran under constant dim red light with a free-running period (tau) of approximately 24 h.  The locomotor activity of the mated queens on the other hand was arrhythmic during the period when they were laying eggs, and robust rhythmicity appeared soon after the egg-laying phase was over.  The tau of the locomotor activity rhythm of mated queens was significantly greater than that of virgin queens.  These results are contrary to the commonly held belief that the role of circadian clocks in ant queens ceases after mating flights, thus suggesting that circadian clocks of ant queens are adaptively plastic and display activity patterns, perhaps depending on their physiological state and tasks in the colony.]",

The virgin males & virgin queens display rhythmic activity patterns, but the mated queens were arrhythmic while laying eggs, with the rhythmicity resuming soon after egg-laying.

Under the continuous darkness regime, most major workers exhibited circadian rhythm of activity with a single steady state, whereas media workers displayed 2 types of activity patterns, with activity patterns changing after 6-9 days in continuous darkness (turn-arounds).  The pre-turn-around tau of the ants that showed nocturnal activity patterns during light/dark entrainment was more-than 24 h after release into continuous darkness, which then became less-than 24 h, after 6-9 days.  On the other hand, the pre-turn-around tau of those ants that exhibited diurnal patterns during light/dark entrainment was first less-than24 h after release into continuous darkness, & then became less-than24 h, after 6-9-days.

The locomotor activity rhythm of most ants entrained to a 24h light/dark (12: 12h;) cycle and free-ran under constant darkness with circadian periodicities.  Under entrained conditions about 75% of media workers displayed nocturnal activity patterns, and the rest showed diurnal activity patterns. In free-running conditions these ants displayed three types of activity patterns (turn-around).  The free-running period (tau) of the locomotor activity rhythm of some ants (10 out of 21) showed period lengthening, and those of a few (6 out of 21) showed period shortening, whereas the locomotor activity rhythm of the rest of the ants (5 out of 21) underwent large phase shifts. Interestingly, the pre-turn-around tau of those ants that showed nocturnal activity patterns during earlier 24h light/dark entrainment was shorter than 24 h, which became greater than 24 h after 6-9 days of free-run in constant darkness.   On the other hand, the pre-turn-around tau of those ants, which exhibited diurnal patterns during earlier 24h light/dark entrainment, was greater than 24 h, which became shorter than 24 h after 6-9 days of free-run in constant darkness.  The patterns of activity under 24h light/dark cycles and the turn-around of activity patterns in constant darkness regime suggest that these ants are shift workers in their respective colonies, and they probably use their circadian clocks for this purpose.  Circadian plasticity thus appears to be a general strategy of the media workers of the ant species C. compressus to cope with the challenges arising due to their roles in the colony constantly exposed to a fluctuating environment.]",

    "abstract": "*[The study was conducted to determine the diversity & abundance of ants along an elevational gradient in Jammu-Kashmir Himalaya.  A total of 144 species in 45 genera & 8 subfamilies have been recorded.  Out of the total 144 species, 3 n.sp. of genus Myrmica are discovered & 4 species represent new record from India.  To avoid methodological edge effects different sampling methods like pitfall traps, leaf litter sifting, stick beating, soil core, honey bait, & hand picking were employed to sample ants.  It was observed that ant species richness increased with increase in elevation & peaked at mid-elevation & thereafter decreased with increase in elevation thus forming an mid elevation peak.  The pattern observed could be attributed to the optimal climatic conditions present at that altitude.  Moreover, the similiarty between 2 elevations was analyzed by using Sorensen, Jaccard, Bray-Curtis, & Morisita-Horn indices.  All similarity indices indicate that elevations of 500 meters & 1000 meters are similar in community composition; similarly elevations of 2000 meters & 3000 meters share maximum number of species in common.  Dissimilarity indices indicate that altitude of 500 meters & 1000 meters did not share even a single species in common with altitude of 4000 meters.  The presence of invasive species at first 3 elevations clearly indicates the deteriorating health of the Himalayan ecosystem.  Out of the 144 species collected, the first 2 elevations are dominated by Indo-Malayan elements, while above 2000-m it is dominated by Palaearctic elements.  23% of the recorded fauna has been found to be endemic to this region.]",

    "abstract": "The study evaluates molybdenum disulfide (MoSÇ) nanoparticles (NPs) induced oxidative stress during cellular toxicity in an invertebrate in vivo system, the weaver ant. The lethal concentration was checked and LCÖÄ was obtained as 50\tµg/mL. Feeding assay and the photoluminescence activity confirmed the ingestion of MoSÇ NPs by the organism. Behavioral assays showed altered grooming behavior in the MoSÇ NP fed ants. A drastic decrease in the hemocyte count in the MoSÇ NP fed ants revealed the anti-proliferative role of MoSÇ. This was further confirmed by 5-bromo-22-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling assay. MoSÇ NPs induced apoptotic activity was also observed in the hemocytes by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining. The level of oxidative stress during cellular toxicity was observed. An increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was observed in the MoSÇ NP fed ants when compared to the control group. The increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the lipid peroxidation (LPO) product were observed. While, the activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and the glutathione content (GSH) were decreased by MoSÇ NPs. The transcript levels of SODs, CAT and GST were up regulated in the treated group. Our results suggest that MoSÇ NPs induced oxidative stress mediates the cellular toxicity in the foragers of the weaver ant.",

    "abstract": "Social insect colonies adopt different levels of survival strategies and exhibit well-defined reproductive division of labour. Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius, 1775) has physiological and behavioral adaptations that enable them to forage at extreme environmental conditions and are lethal to most other insects. Ion homeostasis is the key process in an organism\u0019s survival mechanism. Among ion pumps, the ATP-dependent sodium\u0013potassium ion pump is essential for maintaining the Naz and Kz ionic balance and is well known as the primary consumer of energy. Oecophylla smaragdina plays pivotal role as a model among social insects for understanding ion homeostasis at the organization level of the castes. We have evaluated the expression and activity of Naz/Kz-ATPase among various castes of O. smaragdina (worker subcastes, queen and male). Real-time PCR and immunoblotting analyses revealed the differential expression of Naz/Kz-ATPase in the castes. Significantly higher expression of Naz/Kz-ATPase mRNA and protein were observed in the minor workers, queen, major workers and males respectively. These results suggest that in the weaver ant colony, the castes might have variously adapted and evolved with a well-developed ion transport mechanism which allows them to perform allocated tasks within the nest and could be a key to their adaptive benefits towards division of labour.",

Of all the 16 ant species that inhabit the domatia of H. brunonis at several sites, the plant is only protected by T. albipes.  We show that only the southernmost population (Solaikolli) in protected by the ant species T. albipes.  Although T. albipes is found in 2 of the 3 populations used in the present study (Sampaji & Solaikolli), it is present in a relatively larger abundance both within the domatia of H. brunonis & in the terrestrial stratum only in the southernmost site (Solaikolli) & is hence able to protect the extrafloral nectary producing structures of H. brunonis at this site.  In comparison, T. albipes is found in low abundance both in the domatia & in the terrestrial stratum in the site Sampaji & does not protect extrafloral nectary producing plant parts of H. brunonis at this site.  We have also experimentally shown that the young leaves of H. brunonis at this southernmost site Solaikolli are protected to a greater extent than the floral bud inflorescences, since T. albipes preferentially utilized extrafloral nectar produced by young leaves compared to extrafloral nectar produced by floral buds at this site.  We have also shown that the floral buds of H. brunonis in the northernmost site are unprotected for 2 reasons.  The first is the absence of the protective ant species T.albipes at this site. Second, the extrafloral nectar produced by some of floral buds at this site is differentially utilized to a much lower extent than floral buds from other sites due to extrafloral nectar from Agumbe being more-than 400-fold more viscous than the extrafloral nectar produced by floral buds at the other 2 sites (Sampaji & Solaikolli).]",

    "abstract": "Pollination systems in which the host plant provides breeding sites for pollinators, invariably within flowers, are usually highly specialized mutualisms. We found that the pollinating bee Braunsapis puangensis breeds within the caulinary domatia of the semi-myrmecophyte Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae), an unusual ant-plant that is polymorphic for the presence of domatia and harbours a diverse invertebrate fauna including protective and non-protective ants in its domatia. B. puangensis is the most common flower visitor that carries the highest proportion of H. brunonis pollen. This myrmecophyte is pollen limited and cross-pollinated by bees in the daytime. Hence, the symbiotic pollinator could provide a benefit to trees bearing domatia by alleviating this limitation. We therefore report for the first time an unspecialized mutualism in which a pollinator is housed in a plant structure other than flowers. Here, the cost to the plant is lower than for conventional brood-site pollination mutualisms where the pollinator develops at the expense of plant reproductive structures.  Myrmecophytes housing resident pollinators are unusual, as ants are known to be enemies of pollinators, and housing them together may decrease the benefits that these residents could individually provide to the host plant.          *[No specific ant species mentioned.]",

    "abstract": "Interactions between potentially mutualistic partners can vary over geographic areas. Myrmecophytes, which are plants harboring ants, often do not exhibit sufficient intraspecific variability to permit comparative studies of myrmecophytic traits over space or time. Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae), a dominant, endemic myrmecophyte of the Indian Western Ghats, is unique in exhibiting considerable variability in myrmecophytic traits, e.g. domatia presence, as well as domatia occupancy and associated ant diversity throughout its geographic range. Although its caulinary domatia are occupied by at least 16 ant species throughout its distribution, young leaves and floral buds producing extrafloral nectar (EFN) are protected by ants from herbivory only in the southernmost region, where Technomyrmex albipes (Dolichoderinae) is the most abundant ant species. The extent of protection by ants was positively related to local species richness of ants and their occupancy of domatia. On the other hand, the highest abundance of interlopers in the domatia, including non-protective ants, the arboreal earthworm Perionyx pullus, and other invertebrates, occurred in sites with the least protection from herbivory by ants. Whereas domatia morphometry did not vary between sites, domatia occupied by protective ants and invertebrate interlopers were longer and broader than empty ones at all sites. The lowest percentage of empty domatia was found at the southernmost site. There was a progressive decline in ant species richness from that found at the sites, to that feeding on H. brunonis EFN, to that occupying domatia, possibly indicating constraints in the interactions with the plants at various levels. Our study of this dominant myrmecophyte emphasizes the impact of local factors such as the availability of suitable ant partners, domatia occupancy, and the presence of interlopers on the emergence of a protection mutualism between ants and plants.",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant interactions often are mediated by extrafloral nectar (EFN) composition that may influence plant visitation by ants. Over a 300 km range in the Indian Western Ghats, we investigated the correlation between the EFN composition of the myrmecophytic ant-plant Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae) and the number and species of ants visiting EFN. EFN composition varied among H. brunonis populations and between plant organs (floral bud vs. young leaf EFN). In general, EFN was rich in sugars with small quantities of amino acids, especially essential amino acids, and had moderate invertase activity. In experiments at the study sites with sugar and amino acid solutions and with leaf or floral bud EFN mimics, dominant EFN-feeding ants differentiated between solutions as well as between mimics. The castration parasite Crematogaster dohrni (northern study site) was the least selective and did not exhibit any clear feeding preferences, while the largely trophobiont-tending non-protective Myrmicaria brunnea (middle study site) preferred higher sucrose concentrations and certain essential/non-essential amino acid mixtures. The mutualistic Technomyrmex albipes (southern study site) preferred sucrose over glucose or fructose solutions and consumed the leaf EFN mimic to a greater extent than the floral bud EFN mimic. This young leaf EFN mimic had low sugar concentrations, the lowest viscosity and sugar:amino acid ratio, was rich in essential amino acids, and appeared ideally suited to the digestive physiology of T. albipes. This preference for young leaf EFN may explain the greater protection afforded to young leaves than to floral buds by T. albipes, and may also help to resolve ant-pollinator conflicts. The differential response of dominant ants to sugar, amino acids, or solution viscosity suggests that plants can fine-tune their interactions with local ants via EFN composition. Thus, EFN can mediate local partner-choice mechanisms in ant-plant interactions.",

    "abstract": "Andrographis paniculata, commonly known as Kalmegh, is an important medicinal plant which exhibits a range of pharmacological characteristics. The present study revealed that under natural and experimental field conditions, the debris soil of the ground-nesting ant (Pheidole latinoda) colonies increased soil fertility and yield of this plant. The growth of Kalmegh planted in the debris amended soil was significantly enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. The yield, in terms of number of branches, number of leaves, plant biomass and number of pods plant-1 was consistently higher for plants grown in debris amended treatments as compared with plants grown in control soil. Concentrations of total C, P, available N (NH4-N, NO3-N) and microbial biomass C and P were significantly higher in the various debris amended soil treatments as compared with the control soil. Significant positive correlations were found between the ecophysiological traits of Kalmegh plants, i.e. leaf area, total biomass and number of fruits plant-1, and the soil chemical properties of the soil. Under natural field conditions also the biomass of Kalmegh plants growing within 5 m distance of P. latinoda nests was significantly higher as compared with plants located at a distance >10 m. Overall, the results suggested that the ecosystem engineering activities of P. latinoda colonies have the potential to contribute to soil fertility and thereby promote enhanced growth and yield of this medicinally important plant. Since colonies of ground-nesting ant species, such as P. latinoda, are abundant in annual cropping systems, they can contribute to agricultural sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Study of the abundance, diversity and nest densities of agroecosystem-inhabiting ant species, in fallow, freshly tilled and cultivated farmers' fields revealed that Pheidole latinoda had highest abundance, nest density and disturbance-tolerance ability. Thirty-one arthropod morphospecies belonging to 12 orders were recorded in the nest entrance rim debris piles of this ant species. Hence, P. latinoda was selected to study the impact of nest rim debris soil on soil fertility and yield of two common crops, rice and tomato, widely cultivated in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India. Experimental field studies revealed that ant-related enrichment results in significant increase of the C, N and P contents of the bulk soil and a doubling of the soil microbial biomass. The soil enrichment significantly enhanced the yield of both the crop plants in a dose-dependent manner. A significant positive correlation was found between the ecophysiological traits including the specific leaf area, plant height and total plant weight of both rice and tomato plants, and the soil chemical constituents i.e. total C, N, P, NH4-N, NO3-N, microbial biomass C, N and P. The ecosystem engineering activities of P. latinoda ant colonies apparently enriched the soil via the nutrient cycling activities of the debris arthropods, on the externally discarded organic refuse. Since P. latinoda increases productivity via increase in soil fertility and also has the potential to suppress insect pests of crops, conservation of such ant species could enhance agricultural sustainability, through multiple pathways.          *[A total number of 15 ant species belonging to 10 genera & 5 subfamilies were found in the pitfall trap collections from the Madhauli village.

    "abstract": "Impact of Pheidole sp., reportedly important in insect pest suppression in agroecosystems was studied on supporting agroecosystem services. This tropical ant species was found to be common and abundant in agroecosystems, with a high nest density and preference for the central, crop-growing zone of annual cropping systems. Physico-chemical characteristics of the debris soil were examined from nests located by the roadside and within two managed ecosystems. The debris soil had significantly higher concentrations of total C, N, P and NO3-N along with higher water-holding capacity and moderate-sized soil particles in comparison to the control soil. The pH of the Pheidole sp. debris soil was shifted towards reduced alkaline conditions. Results reveal that annually, 2.44 kg/ha C, 0.071 kg/ha P, 0.628 kg/ha N and 0.009 kg/ha NO3-N are added to the soil through the accumulation of organic refuse at the nest rim. This contributes to soil nutrient enhancement and is suggested to enhance ecosystem productivity. The high nutrient content of nest debris soil is linked to the predominance of arthropod carcasses (93.7% of the total organic refuse) in the refuse piles derived from the animal-based food (70.3%) brought to the nests by the foragers. Plant-based food was 29.6% (seeds, leaves, roots, etc.) of the total indicating a minor role of Pheidole sp. as a seed harvester. The results suggest an important role of Pheidole sp. in regulating the soil nutrients as an ecosystem engineer.",

Past studies investigating the effects of invasive plants on herbivores and carnivores have been largely observational in nature and thus lack the ability to tease apart whether differences are a cause or consequence of the invasion. In addition, understanding how plant traits and plant species compositions change in invaded habitats may increase our ability to predict when and where invasive plants will have effects that cascade to animals. To assess effects on arthropods, we experimentally introduced a non-native plant (Microstegium vimineum, Japanese stiltgrass) in a community re-assembly experiment. We also investigated possible mechanisms through which the invader could affect associated arthropods, including changes in native plant species richness, above-ground plant biomass, light availability and vegetation height. In experimentally invaded plots, arthropod abundance was reduced by 39%, and species richness declined by 19%. Carnivores experienced greater reductions in abundance than herbivores (61% vs 31% reduction). Arthropod composition significantly diverged between experimentally invaded and control plots, and particular species belonging to the abundant families Aphididae (aphids), Formicidae (ants) and Phalacridae (shining flower beetles) contributed the most to compositional differences. Among the mechanisms we investigated, only the reduction in native plant species richness caused by invasion was strongly correlated with total arthropod abundance and richness. In sum, our results demonstrate negative impacts of M. vimineum invasion on higher trophic levels and suggest that these effects occur, in part, indirectly through invader-mediated reductions in the richness of the native plant community. The particularly strong response of carnivores suggests that plant invasion could reduce top-down control of herbivorous species for native plants.",

    "abstract": "Studies on reproductive biology are difficult but useful in species like Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa which is of considerable socio-economic importance and possess morphogenetic variation and qualities of wider adaptability to different soils. Cytology, phenology, pollination, breeding system and natural regeneration of wild and cultivated trees from India revealed the existence of diploid (2n = 18) and tetraploid trees (2n = 36) in Pachmarhi hills and only diploid trees in Punjab plains and Shiwalik hills. The diploid and tetraploid trees showed normal meiosis and high pollen fertility. Phenological events which included leaf fall, leaf emergence, floral bud break, flowering and fruiting are nearly the same in wild and cultivated trees. Natural pollen transfer in the species was highly efficient. Levels of fruit set following open pollination was quite high and is reduced considerably following hand pollination probably due to some injury caused to stigma during experiments. In spite of synchronous nature of anther dehiscence and stigmatic receptivity, selfing in a flower was avoided due to herkogamy. Some selfing, however, occurred through geitonogamous mode as bagging of panicles yielded 12.21 +- 0.99 to 14.12 +- 0.91% fruit set. High pollen ovule ratio (9,250-10,600) indicated toward the obligate outbreeding nature. The species suited to insect and wind mode of pollination. High amount of air borne pollen grains deposited on glycerine smeared glass microscopic slides suggested towards the wind mode of pollination. Though flowers are dull coloured a variety of insects visited the flowers due to sweet fragrance and stamen/pollen as food reward. Among insect pollinators, honey bee (Apis dorsata) was the major and legitimate pollinator while the rest were either minor pollinators or mere visitors. Inspite of high fruit/seed set, natural regeneration through seeds was poor as fallen fruits were destroyed by fungal pathogens and white ants. The species also propagated vegetatively through coppices and root suckers. It lacks agamospermy as bagging of emasculated flowers yielded no fruit. It is inferred that 'bael' which lacks agamospermy reproduced successfully through gamospermy (xenogamy and geitonogamy) and vegetative mode (coppices and root suckers). We also concluded that tetraploid trees growing in the Pachmarhi hills with large sized fruits possessed better potentialities in horticulture if planted through root suckers or coppices.          *[Solenopsis geminata was one of the insects which visited flowers at 3 of 4 sites.]",

While studying the feeding ecology of these tiger beetles in rice paddy agro-ecosystems in Sringeri area of the central Western Ghats, we examined their potential as biocontrols on the major rice paddy pest populations available in this region. Earthworms and tadpoles were significant prey organisms during the early cultivation period, while other traditional prey organisms like ants and spiders (mainly wolf and jumping spiders) were more common as prey organisms toward the mid-season. The results showed that the feeding fauna of tiger beetles can extend to prey items beyond arthropods, to include vertebrates. Cicindela (Calochroa) duponti Dejean is another common species that occurs abundantly in the Areca orchards and on the bunds that separate rice paddy fields from adjacent uncultivated lands. We performed laboratory tests to determine the feeding guild of these beetles, and to investigate their possible role as a predator of the rice paddy pests. Although preliminary in nature, the results suggest that both C. whithilli and C. flavomaculata are ineffective as biocontrol agents of rice paddy agro-ecosystems.

    "abstract": "Vateria indica is a critically-endangered and economically-important tree endemic to the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in India. Due to extreme local endemism and anthropogenic destructive harvesting of resin, the species is categorized as critically endangered. The present study investigated the biotic limiting factors of recruitment of V. inidica in its natural populations, and studied the pattern of anthropogenic harvest of nuts of V. indica in the recent past. Seed predation and seedling herbivory particularly by insects were assessed. The sustainability of the nut harvest was assessed by conducting pre- and post-harvest censuses of nuts on forest floors. Over 90 % of the fruits of V. indica were infested by the insects, but, only about 10 % of the infested fruits were seed-predated. Seedling herbivores included a leaf miner, ants of two species, and larvae of a lymantrid moth. Seedling mortality due to herbivores was moderate (45.5 %). Pre- and post-harvest censuses showed that only 3.81 % of the fruits that were naturally-fallen on the forest floor were spared after the harvest had taken place. Sringeri has exported 820 metric tons of nuts in the study year, which was an all-time high estimate. The study concludes that the anthropogenic nut collection can hamper the population structure of V. indica locally. Since V. indica has an alternate-year major flowering cycle, the seed loss as seen in the present study is critical. Raising plantations of V. indica as an afforestation program can contribute to the conservation of the species and the development of local communities.",

    "abstract": "Yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes (F. Smith); YCA) is known for its aggressive predatory ability and ability to exert exploitation competition on both native and other invasive ants via floral nectar. We argue that YCA invasion can exert both interference and exploitation competition on legitimate pollinators. In pumpkin fields (Cucurbita maxima L.) of south India, YCA infested the flowers, particularly the pistillate flowers, for nectar foraging. Pumpkin is a honey bee-mediated cross-pollinated monoecious plant that produces disproportionately very few pistillate flowers. We hypothesize that YCA presence in the flowers can affect the visitation rate and foraging time of honey bees in the flowers, the fruit set in pumpkins, and can exert predatory pressure on the honey bees if the bees linger in ant-colonized flowers. Both YCA and honey bees preferred to forage on the limited pistillate flowers in the plants. After colonizing the flowers, YCA did not retreat for hours, even upon disturbance by competitors, such as honey bees. Both the visitation frequency and the foraging time of honey bees were drastically reduced in ant-colonized flowers, and none of the ant-colonized flowers developed into fruits, suggesting that the YCA exert both an ecological and evolutionary pressure on pumpkin. The ants preyed upon about 17% of the honey bees that lingered in ant-colonized flowers, and the time the bees spent foraging predicted the fate of the bees. Exploitation competition exerted by the YCA on pumpkin may have far-reaching consequences for the pollination and productivity of this cash crop.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural intensification can decrease biodiversity and ecosystem services they deliver to agroecosystems. Diverse trees-shaded coffee is structurally and functionally complex and has biodiversity adequate for sustainable production of coffee and mitigation of biodiversity loss due to deforestation. However, shade tree simplification is intense in coffee agroforests worldwide, threatening their economic and environmental targets. In south India, native trees have been replaced by silver oak (Grevillea robusta) trees. Native trees-shaded coffee is floristically complex and diverse than oak-shaded coffee. We hypothesize that the natural prey removal fares better in native trees-shaded coffee than in oak-shaded coffee. Artificial caterpillar models of three colors were installed rotationally on leaves, stems, and branches of coffee plants in native trees-shaded- and oak-shaded coffee, and assessed the predation rates for fruiting and leaf-flushing periods of coffee to test this. Forty-four percent of the caterpillars were predated. Arthropods, and in particular the ants, were the predominant predators. Lizards followed by birds, and mammals were second, third, and fourth important predators of coffee agroforests. Overall, predation rates did not differ with the shade diversity, but lizard predation rates were higher in diverse trees-shaded coffee than in oak-shaded coffee. The predation rates were slightly higher in the fruiting season of coffee. Predation rates of any predator taxa were higher for the caterpillars placed on stems and branches than on leaves. The study does not support the hypothesis that the natural predation rates might be higher in floristically complex coffee agroforests, but highlights the biocontrol potential of lizards in diverse-shaded coffee.",

Of late, H. theivora expanded the host range attacking certain weeds, vegetables and medicinal plants. Following a farmer complaint, field investigations on eggplant and amaranth plot at Kollam District, Kerala, India were conducted. Individual plants were observed for the symptoms, immature or adult stages of pests. The investigations revealed new feeding hosts of H. theivora on eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and green amaranth (Amaranthus sp.). The infestation caused 98% damage on eggplant. Blighted appearance of leaves and scabs were noticed on leaves and fruits of eggplant, respectively whereas whitish speckles were observed on amaranth leaves. The red ant, Oecophylla smaragdina (F.) was found as a potential predator of TMB on eggplant ecosystem. The current observations on TMB highlight the first report of the pest on cultivated eggplant and amaranth. The expanding host range of TMB on a wide spectrum of economic plants warrants extensive and exhaustive pest surveillance and intensive scouting and monitoring mechanism for designing effective pest management solutions.",

No preference was exhibited by ants where natural populations were absent. Preference at the other two sites was frequency dependent: ants preferred seeds of the introduced species. Species preferred by ants have higher seed and seedling survival because by being carried into ant nests they escape predation and avoid nutrient deficiency.

We studied patterns of seed dispersal by ants and seed predation by rodents of these two herbs at three spatial scales: (1) among three woodlots that differed in density and size of Hepatica and/or Trillium populations, (2) between two sites within each woodlot located inside and outside a natural population, and (3) between replicate quadrats within each site. We estimated ant numbers and rodent presence using baits. In contrast to other studies done on other ant-dispersed species, seed predation by rodents was rare or nonexistent for both species even though rodents were present at all sites. Seed removal rates by ants were quite patchy at the scale of a few square metres within sites, but generally were slower where seed populations were dense and extensive. This indicates that ants become satiated during and immediately after seeds are released from parent plants growing in dense populations. Hence, seed dispersal is often ant-limited within well established populations of myrmecochores. Edaphic-topographic factors also play an important indirect role in seed dispersal through their effect on local ant numbers. The evolutionary role of seed predation on myrmecochory, and the demographic implications of density-dependent seed dispersal are discussed.",

One major biological feature of the island is the unusually high density of red crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis), which are considered a 'keystone species'.  In the late 1990s, G. natalis was extirpated from large areas of Christmas Island after the formation of supercolonies by the introduced yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes).  Here we report on the outcomes of a biannual island-wide survey that has now been conducted 5 times to monitor changes in crab burrow densities relative to ant baiting.  On each survey, occupied G. natalis burrows are counted along a 50 meter transect at 877 survey points across the island.  We used a Bayesian hierarchical spatial model to show that despite the death of up to 33% of G. natalis in the early phase of ant supercolony formation, densities of crab burrows have remained stable since 2001.]",

Over the last 30 or so years, 5 of the 6 species have declined to near extinction with the remaining species, C. sadleiri, still reasonably common.

We document the declines in the native species & discuss possible causal factors in view of the available knowledge.  We conclude that predation by introduced species is likely to be the key factor in the declines of the native reptiles, but other processes, such as inter-specific competition, may also be important.

    "abstract": "*[At Ivimka, workers of 2 species of Aenictinae were collected.  Based on the males, we have a minimum of 5 species at Ivimka.  Because these male species cannot now be associated with workers, the present list is assumed to be inflated.   Wilson (1959b) recorded 11 species of from New Guinea, six of which were noted to be present at the Lower Busu River site (not four as stated by Wilson 1959c). At Ivimka, ten species Cerapachys, Cerapachyinae, were recorded, of these, 7 appear to be new species.   At Ivimka, the subfamily Dolichoderinae includes only a few species of non-stinging ants, most of which are arboreal.  Fifteen species were encountered at Ivimka, of which 2 are non-native.  Tapinoma melanocephalum is a now tropicopolitan tramp species originally from Africa.  Technomyrmex albipes is of Asian origin & now widespread from India to Australia, Oceania, & California.  These are both insinuators that have apparently minimal impact on established native species.   Formicinae is among the 3 most species rich in the Ivimka area with 58 species in 9 genera.  The genus Polyrachis is the most species rich ant genus with 28 species recorded during the survey.  The subfamily also includes the largest ant species found, Camponotus dorycus.  Among the specimens collected on the survey are one undescribed species of Echinopla, one of Paratrechina, & 3 of Polyrhachis.   The Myrmicinae is by far the most species rich subfamily in the Lakekamu Basin with 103 species in 26 genera.  Members of the subfamily represent a diverse array of habits, including predators to coccid-tending exudate feeders.  At least 7 collected species are new species & at least one represents a new genus.   A total of 57 species of Ponerinae in 17 genera were collected.  At least 2 species collected are new to science.  A single male specimen, collected in a Malaise trap, is evidently the first New Guinea record of the rare genus Probolomyrmex.   Pseudomyrmecinae are largely tropical, with only Tetraponera in the Old World.  At Ivimka, four species were collected, none of which appear to be new to science.]",

    "abstract": "*[The species comprising the Camponotus montivagus complex of MacKay & MacKay (1997) are re-examined.  Although the MacKays placed this complex in the subgenus Myrmentoma, it is here removed from that subgenus & left unassigned until the relationships of all the New World subgenera of Camponotus are properly reevaluated, a task beyond the scope of this paper.  Based on an examination of appropriate type material, I have determined that the MacKays misidentified 2 of the species.  Specimens that are a part of the original sample from which C. nitidus Norton was described have been examined; since the name is a junior homonym, a replacement name, C. rectithorax was proposed by Forel (1895).  The 'lectotype' proposed by the MacKays for C. rectithorax Forel, is invalid, since it was not from Norton's original material; a proper lectotype is here designated.  The putative 'lectotype' is actually a syntype of C. montivagus; C. montivagus & C. rectithorax, sensu the Mackays, are thus coextensive.  The species that they incorrectly identified as C. montivagus is equivalent to Norton's species & thus properly bears the name C. rectithorax.  Camponotus montivagus var. nuperus Wheeler 1914 is a synonym of C. rectithorax (new synonymy).  Camponotus pertusus MacKay & MacKay, described from several workers from Trinidad is removed from this species complex & placed in the synonymy of the Nearctic species C. essigi M.R. Smith (new synonymy); the type locality is apparently not the West Indian island of Trinidad, but instead is presumably Trinidad, Humboldt County, California.  The C. montivagus complex is recharacterized in light of the above changes & a new key is presented for the species of this complex.  Each species is represented by appropriate illustrations.]   Note Response by W.P. Mackay and E.E. Mackay, p. 613-615.",

Only less than 50 % of the cashew trees were harbored by red ants in different orchards & during the rainy season.  There was a further reduction in ant population & then a gradual increase during post rainy season.  Food provision resulted in 10.3 fold increase in number of nests, compared to 1.35 fold increases in control over a period of just 33 days.

Fifty% of the 190 plants in an orchard were colonized with red ants.  Pest population, extent of damage, & yield parameters were recorded for 3 years for both treated & untreated plants, coinciding with flushing, flowering, & fruiting phases of the crop.  Bug population was significantly lower in plants colonized by red ants.  The mean population values varied from 1.61 to 9.76 for untreated plants & 0 to 0.07 for treated plants.  The extent of damage in untreated plants varied from 20.45% to 92.9%, whereas in treated plants the damage was negligible 0.02% to 0.009%.  The mean number of immature nuts was significantly higher in treated plants as compared to untreated plants.  The average yield recorded from red ant free trees varied from 0.39 kg to 3.85 kg per tree, while that of plants colonized by red ants were significantly higher at 5.01 to 15.75 kg.  Production period was also extended by 2 months in treated plants, compared to untreated plants.  The net effect of colonization by ants was an increase in yield by 400 per cent by the third year of the study.  The cost benefit ratio worked out indicates that the red ant technology is economically more viable than chemical pesticides.]",

Three trial & control sites were selected according to the density of YCAs from high to low density.  All sites were monitored for 6 weeks prior to baiting to ensure there were no impacts on native species.  Ant counts for density analysis & monitoring of other invertebrates was undertaken at each site.  Positive results were obtained with a decline in YCA density in all 3 baited sites compared to the control sites.  YCAs were absent from the Greta baited site for a period of more than 9 months, indicating possible local area eradication.  From the results it is very clear that the bait has had a significant impact on YCAs.  As YCA density decreased in the baited area there was an increase in density of YCAs in each of the controls.  Analysis of the data has shown strong evidence that boric acid is an effective bait for the control of YCAs, & that it is a safer & significantly more environmentally friendly approach to control YCAs compared to the present fipronil baiting regime on Christmas Island.]",

To assess the potential for non-target impacts of this baiting program, canopy-dwelling arthropods & selected vertebrates were sampled in 4 forest treatments: uninfested by A. gracilipes; infested but aerially baited several days earlier; infested but hand-baited 12-24 months previously; &, infested but untreated.  Canopy arthropods from the lower canopy of 5 species of tree were sampled immediately after aerial baiting to determine the abundance & diversity of the arthropod fauna in infested & uninfested areas & the potential impact of the insecticide on the arthropod fauna.  Relative abundances of terrestrial, diurnal bird species, & the nocturnal Christmas Island gecko were estimated at replicate sites within the 4 treatments in September 2002 & April 2003 to detect the potential for immediate & medium-term effects of the baiting program on habitat use.  Non-baited infested sites & those that had recently been aerially baited showed significantly elevated levels of both A. gracilipes & scale insects in the canopy, & the relative abundances of these 2 taxa were highly correlated.  After counts of A. gracilipes & scale insects had been removed, no significant differences in the overall abundance of arthropods or the number of orders encountered could be detected across the 4 treatments. Although our samples & counts were small, we conclude that, with the exception of reductions in abundance in the imperial pigeon, the immediate to medium-term impacts of the aerial baiting strategy on vertebrates & immediate impact on canopy arthropods were minimal & that, given the importance of control of A. gracilipes for the conservation of terrestrial fauna, such baiting programs should be supported.]",

Of the 94 lycaenid species hitherto recorded to occur in Kerala, we reared 67 species. Based on larval rearing and literature review, we found that 55.3% of lycaenids in the state were myrmecophilous, 19.1% were myrmecoxenous, and 25.5% were data deficient. Eight species of lycaenids, previously unrecorded as myrmecophilous, were confirmed to be myrmecophilous, and seven species of ants were newly detected to be lycaenophilous. Twenty-two interactions had a hitherto unrecorded ant genus, and 42 involved an unreported ant species. A little less than one-fifth of the studied unique interactions were obligatory. Obligatory interaction was highest in the lycaenid Cigaritis Donzel, 1847, followed by Anthene Doubleday, 1847, Arhopala Boisduval, 1832, Catapaecilma Butler, 1879, and Zesius H¸bner, 1819. Amongst butterflies, the highest number of ant associations was observed for Jamides celeno celeno (Cramer, [1775]) and Thaduka multicaudata kanara Evans, 1925. Native ants dominated the interactions (77.1% vs. 22.9%). Amongst the ants, Crematogaster Lund, 1831, dominated the unique interactions followed by Anoplolepis Santschi, 1914 and Camponotus Mayr, 1861.

It is generally believed that individuals who perform a specific task are themselves simple, interchangeable units. However, the variances in the performances of these individual insects need to be explored in greater detail. In this study, individual specialization in the context of colony relocation was examined in the Indian ponerine ant Diacamma indicum. One ant termed the maximum tandem leader (Max TL) was found to have a key role. Max TL performed 24% of the adult relocation in the colony and recruited more tandem leaders than other leaders thereby contributing to the organization of the relocation. The Max TL's role in the relocation process was further examined by comparing control relocations with experiments in which the Max TL was removed during the relocation process. Even though all the colonies relocated successfully, the relocation dynamics was significantly altered in the absence of the Max TL. We find that a single individual, the Max TL, takes up roles of a performer, organizer and catalyst during the colony relocation process, which challenges the norm that all workers are equal.",

    "abstract": "*[We ask if ants at low elevations could compete with birds for arthropod prey.  Specifically, we studied the impact of the Asian weaver ant (Oecophylla smaragdina), a common aggressive ant at low elevations.  Diet analysis using molecular methods demonstrate extensive diet overlap between weaver ants & songbirds at both low & mid\u0010elevations.  Trees without weaver ants have greater non\u0010ant arthropod abundance & leaf damage.  Experimental removal of weaver ants results in an increase in the abundance of non\u0010ant arthropods.  Notably, numbers of Coleoptera & Lepidoptera were most affected by removal experiments & were prominent components of bird & weaver ant diets.  Our results suggest that songbirds & weaver ants might potentially compete with each other for arthropod prey at low elevations, which contributing to lower insectivorous bird diversity at low elevations in E Himalaya.]",

Of 67 published datasets from the literature, only those with standardized, comprehensive sampling were used.  Datasets included both local & regional ant diversity & spanned 80 degrees in latitude across 6 biogeographical provinces.  We used a combination of simulations, linear regressions, & non-parametric statistics to test multiple quantitative predictions of each hypothesis.  We used an environmentally & geometrically constrained model as well as multiple regression to test their interactions.  Ant diversity showed 3 distinct patterns across elevations: most common were hump-shaped mid-elevation peaks in diversity, followed by low-elevation plateaus & monotonic decreases in the number of ant species.  The elevational climate model, which proposes that temperature & precipitation jointly drive diversity, & area were partially supported as independent drivers.  Thermal energy & the mid-domain effect were not supported as primary drivers of ant diversity globally.  The interaction models supported the influence of multiple drivers, though not a consistent set.  In contrast to many vertebrate taxa, global ant elevational diversity patterns appear more complex, with the best environmental model contingent on precipitation levels.]",

    "abstract": "Non\u0010native ants can cause ecosystem\u0010wide ecological change, and these changes are generally assumed to be negative. Despite this, the evidence base has never been holistically synthesised to quantify whether and to what degree non\u0010native ants impact native species diversity. In this study, we performed a meta\u0010analysis of the effects of ant invasion on animal communities. We extracted data from 46 published articles investigating abundance (156 effect sizes) and richness (53 effect sizes) responses of animal taxa to ant invasion in locations relatively unimpacted by other stressors (e.g. human disturbance, other non\u0010native species) to help isolate the effects of invasion. Overall, local animal diversity declined severely, with species abundance and richness lower by 42.79% and 53.56%, respectively, in areas with non\u0010native ants compared with intact uninvaded sites. We then combined responses of individual animal taxa extracted from an article into a single response to represent the \u0018community\u0019 abundance (40 effect sizes) or richness (28 effect sizes) response to non\u0010native ants represented in each article. Local communities decreased substantially in total abundance (52.67%) and species richness (53.47%) in invaded sites. These results highlight non\u0010native ants as the drivers, rather than passengers, of large net\u0010negative reductions to animal community diversity in relatively undisturbed systems around the world, approximately halving local species abundance and richness in invaded areas. Improved international prevention processes, early detection systems harnessing emerging technologies, and well\u0010designed control measures deployable by conservation practitioners are urgently needed if these effects are to be mitigated, prevented or reversed.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species are one of the main reasons for the ongoing global loss of biodiversity. Anoplolepis gracilipes is an invasive ant that has recently received significant attention due to its negative effect on the native fauna and flora of Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. This species has contributed to a drastic change in the structure of the Christmas Island rainforest through its negative impact on the island's endemic red land crab, the dominant consumer on the islands forest floor. In this study, we investigate the population structure of A. gracilipes on Christmas Island in order to determine whether multiple introductions occurred on the island and how they correspond to known infestations. We genotyped 578 individuals collected from 50 nests across the Island. We identify two distinct subgroups in the population that represent two different supercolonies. These supercolonies are interspersed across the island, however both nuclear (microsatellites) and mitochondrial markers strongly suggest that there is no gene flow between the two colonies. Significant heterozygote excess within the entire sampling area, with all but one worker examined being heterozygous for all seven microsatellite loci, suggests an unusual reproductive system in these ants. Our results are consistent with recent sociogenetic findings in a population of A. gracilipes in Northern Borneo.",

Maxforce bait granules were more readily accepted than either Niban or Baygon bait granules in the spring. A change in food preference from protein to sugar by the black carpenter ant appeared to reduce the number of Maxforce bait granules removed in the fall, resulting in no differences in bait acceptability. The longevity of Dursban 50W and Tempo 20WP were evaluated in the summer and fall on painted wood panels. Panels aged outside for 15 d under prevailing weather conditions exhibited increased LT50 values. For each sampling period, panels aged on the south face (in the sun) exhibited less insecticidal activity (i.e., large LT50 values) than panels on the north face (shaded; small LT50 values). At each sampling period, Tempo 20WP provided smaller LT50 values than Dursban 50W. Because of changing dietary preferences, our data highlight the importance of using various bait types for carpenter ant control. Moreover, the application of residual spays should be made to locations protected from direct sunlight.",

    "abstract": "Clonal reproduction can provide an advantage for invasive species to establish as it can circumvent inbreeding depression which often plagues introduced populations. The world's most widespread invasive ant, Paratrechina longicornis, was previously found to display a double\u0010clonal reproduction system, whereby both males and queens are produced clonally, resulting in separate male and queen lineages, while workers are produced sexually. Under this unusual reproduction mode, inbreeding is avoided in workers as they carry hybrid interlineage genomes. Despite the ubiquitous distribution of P. longicornis, the significance of this reproductive system for the ant's remarkable success remains unclear, as its prevalence is still unknown. Further investigation into the controversial native origin of P. longicornis is also required to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of double\u0010clonal lineages. Here, we examine genetic variation and characterize the reproduction mode of P. longicornis populations sampled worldwide using microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences to infer the ant's putative native range and the distribution of the double\u0010clonal reproductive system. Analyses of global genetic variations indicate that the Indian subcontinent is a genetic diversity hotspot of this species, suggesting that P. longicornis probably originates from this geographical area. Our analyses revealed that both the inferred native and introduced populations exhibit double\u0010clonal reproduction, with queens and males around the globe belonging to two separate, nonrecombining clonal lineages. By contrast, workers are highly heterozygous because they are first\u0010generation interlineage hybrids. Overall, these data indicate a worldwide prevalence of double clonality in P. longicornis and support the prediction that the unusual genetic system may have pre\u0010adapted this ant for global colonization by maintaining heterozygosity in the worker force and alleviating genetic bottlenecks.",

    "abstract": "*[We examine worldwide genetic variation in Paratrechina longicornis & its associated Wolbachia bacterial symbionts. Analyses of mtDNA sequences of 248 P. longicornis workers (one per colony) from 13 geographic regions reveal 2 highly diverged mtDNA clades that co-occur in most of the geographic regions.  These two mtDNA clades are associated with different Wolbachia infection patterns, but are not congruent with patterns of nDNA (microsatellite) variation.  Multilocus sequence typing reveals 2 distinct Wolbachia strains in P. longicornis, namely, wLonA & wLonF.  The evolutionary histories of these 2 strains differ; wLonA appears to be primarily transmitted maternally, & patterns of mtDNA & nDNA variation & wLonA infection status are consistent with a relatively recent Wolbachia-induced selective sweep.  In contrast, the observed patterns of mtDNA variation & wLonF infections suggest frequent horizontal transfer &  losses of wLonF infections.  The lack of nDNA structure among sampled geographic regions coupled with the finding that numerous mtDNA haplotypes are shared among regions implies, that inadvertent long-distance movement through human commerce is common in P. longicornis & has shaped the genetic structure of this invasive ant worldwide.]",

Here, we report the genome size for 40 species of ants distributed across 10 of the 20 currently recognized subfamilies, thus making Formicidae the 4th most surveyed insect family and elevating the Hymenoptera to the 5th most surveyed insect order.  Our analysis spans much of the ant phylogeny, from the less derived Amblyoponinae and Ponerinae to the more derived Myrmicinae, Formicinae and Dolichoderinae.  Our results show that ants possess small genomes relative to most other insects, yet genome size varies 3-fold across this insect family.   Moreover, our data suggest that 2 whole-genome duplications may have occurred in the ancestors of the modern Ectatomma and Apterostigma.  Although some previous studies of other taxa have revealed a relationship between genome size and body size, our phylogenetically controlled analysis of this correlation did not reveal a significant relationship.This is the first analysis of genome size in Formicidae and the first across multiple species of social insects.  We show that genome size is a variable trait that can evolve gradually over long time spans, as well as rapidly, through processes that may include occasional whole-genome duplication.]",

    "abstract": "*[We review & synthesise all existing literature on ant-termite interactions.  We infer that ant predation on termites is the most important, most widespread, & most studied type of interaction.  Predatory ant species can regulate termite populations & subsequently slow down the decomposition of wood, litter, & soil organic matter.  As a consequence, they also affect plant growth & distribution, nutrient cycling, & nutrient availability.  Although some ant species are specialized termite predators, there is probably a high level of opportunistic predation by generalist ant species, & hence their impact on ecosystem processes that termites are known to provide varies at the species level.  The most fruitful future research direction will be to evaluate the impact of ant-termite predation on broader ecosystem processes.  To do this it will be necessary to quantify the efficacy both of particular ant species & of ant communities as a whole in regulating termite populations in different biomes.  We envisage that this work will require a combination of methods, including DNA barcoding of ant gut contents along with field observations & exclusion experiments.  Such a combined approach is necessary for assessing how this interaction influences entire ecosystems.]",

    "abstract": "Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo - Crivelli) Vuillemin based mycoinsecticides are used against agricultural, veterinary and medical insect pests. The fungus has a very diverse and extensive host range. Variation in virulence among isolates of B. bassiana to different insect species has been abundantly documented. Given the effect of multiple factors on virulence, it is not certain whether the observed difference in virulence can be labelled as host specificity. Environmental conditions and susceptibility of the insect population are two main factors that affect successful fungal infection. Keeping the environmental factors constant, if virulence of an isolate to different insect species and different populations within an insect species is compared, the scale of difference between the two responses can be estimated. If differences in virulence of an isolate to different insect species are greater than the difference in virulence to different insect populations within an insect species, then, the isolate can be considered as exhibiting specific preference to those insect species towards which it exhibits high virulence. To examine this feature, a worldwide sample of B. bassiana was bioassayed on nine insect species and two different populations within two insect species. Laboratory bioassays were done on: Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera), Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera), Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera), Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera), Epilachna vigintioctopunctata (Coleoptera), Mylabris pustulata (Coleoptera), Aphis craccivora (Homoptera), Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Hemiptera) and Oecophylla smaragdina (Hymenoptera). The range of variation in virulence of a B. bassiana isolate to different insect species was not more than that observed with different populations within a single insect species. B. bassiana is thus a generalist with no strict host preference. B. bassiana based biopesticide can be used as a broad spectrum insecticide against a myriad of insect pests.",

Collecting methods included pitfall traps, tuna baits, mini-Winkler extraction of leaf litter, Malaise traps, entomological nets, & direct search.  The soil and understory ant inventory resulted in 107 ant species & morphospecies, in 46 genera in 12 subfamilies.  Myrmicinae held the highest species richness (37 species), followed by Ponerinae (27); Formicinae (12).  The richest genera were Pachycondyla (15 species), Camponotus (9), & Pheidole (8), while 30 genera were represented by a single species.  Twelve species were very common (both in distribution & time): Azteca sp., Atta cephalotes, Camponotus sericeiventris, Eciton vagans, Ectatomma goninion, Gnamptogenys annulata, Odontomachus bauri, Pachycondyla bugabensis, P. harpax, P. verenae, Paraponera clavata, & Wasmannia auropunctata.  Direct search was the most efficient method to collect diferent species & was responsible for 52% of the total species found.  Compared to other Neotropical islands, Gorgona holds a suprisingly high number of ant species, none of them invasive.

    "abstract": "*[We used the pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis, as a test species, since it is an urban pest, residing inside buildings & hospitals.  We devised a lab scale setup to determine the insecticidal effectiveness of 32 different materials from several material classes.  Diatomaceous earth was used as a benchmark.  We also determined the material properties to investigate their influence on insecticidal effectiveness.  The results showed that activated carbon was the most insecticidal material, with a mean forager survival time of only 25 minutes.  Zeolites also performed well, but their shortest mean survival time was 40 minutes.  We also showed that the material properties determining insecticidal effectiveness depended on the type of material used.  For zeolites, the most important material property was the BET specific surface area, which proved to be the large mesopore surface area & for the activated carbon materials, the particle size had the greatest effect on insecticidal effectiveness.  We conducted an assessment of the best delivery method for the activated carbon.  For this purpose, the queen mortality was monitored, since this ultimately defines colony survival.  A bait formula, mimicked by mixing food with either activated carbon powder or pellets, proved to be the least effective delivery method.  While the food was entrained & the powder treatment even resulted in high forager mortality, no queens died as a result of the treatment.  Application of activated carbon as a barrier proved to be more effective, with a median survival time of 47 hours, but the practical application seemed limited.  A surface treatment, directly targeting the nest, proved to be the best delivery method, resulting in a median survival time of 1.5 hours.  However, queens escaping this treatment did not return to the nest, which could result in colony relocation. For this reason we suggest incorporating activated carbon in an IPM system.  We analyzed the epicuticular wax layer by immersing pharaoh ants in n-hexane.  This provided us with the composition of the wax layer as well as the major alkaloids excreted by the abdominal glands.  We identified 4 alkaloids which were not previously reported in Monomorium species.  The zeolites selectively adsorbed specific compounds from the epicuticular wax layer, leading to the identification of 3 compounds, which were not found in the hexane wash.  We discovered both pronounced shape & size selectivity in the zeolites with the smallest pore sizes & inverse shape selectivity in H-BEA-300.  Since one of the most adsorbent zeolites showed very little insecticidal effectivity, we conclude that adsorption selectivity lies at the basis of insecticidal effectivity, not the adsorption capacity.]          *[The first colony of pharaoh ants was obtained from Purdue University, Indiana, USA; research conducted in Belgium.]",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Historically, inert insecticidal powders such as diatomaceous earth were researched for pest management applications, and it was revealed that these types of powders killed insects by desiccation. However, data on the critical material properties that affect their efficacy are sparse. The present study investigated the insecticidal effect of powdered materials on the pharaoh ant, a notorious domestic pest. RESULTS: The insecticidal activity of 24 porous materials was tested. Eight of these materials performed better than the benchmark, diatomaceous earth. Zeolite Y and carbon black II performed best, inducing 50% mortality within 40 and 55 minutes, respectively. Statistical analysis of seven material properties revealed that macroporous surface area and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area were most predictive of insecticidal activity. For zeolites and ordered mesoporous silica materials, the most important parameters were, respectively, BET and large mesopore surface area. Finally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis confirmed the adsorption of epicuticular hydrocarbons onto the zeolite powders. CONCLUSION: This study shows clear potential for the use of environmentally friendly, inert porous materials as insecticides against the pharaoh ant and identified the key material properties influencing insecticidal activity. The GC-MS data support the hypothesis that the mortality was caused by the removal of the protective epicuticular hydrocarbons. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.          *[The first colony of pharaoh ants was obtained from Purdue University, Indiana, USA; research conducted in Belgium.]",

    "abstract": "Non-toxic and environmentally friendly insecticidal powders have grown in popularity as pest control products to substitute traditional pesticide-based methods. The pharaoh ant is an ideal test species for insecticidal dusts and it is an indoor pest, mostly found in heated buildings where it can pose severe risks because of its ability to destroy electrical equipment and transfer diseases in hospitals. The use of commercially available activated carbon and carbon black materials as insecticidal dust is of great interest, since these types of materials proved effective in previous research and they have been little researched in the past. In the present study, we compared the effectiveness of 11 different carbon materials to reveal the key material properties defining the insecticidal action. All of the materials, with the exception of Printex U, performed better than the benchmark diatomaceous earth, which is presently the most widely used insecticidal dust. The shortest median survival time, 25 min, was observed upon exposure to activated carbon powder, which was significantly shorter than the 95 min observed for diatomaceous earth. Model selection revealed that particle size was the most important parameter determining insecticidal activity for activated carbon materials. Overall, our findings highlight the potential for the use of carbon materials as insecticidal agents, not just for the control of the pharaoh ant, but potentially also to control other domestic or agricultural pests in confined spaces, such as stored grain pests or bed bugs.          *[The first colony of pharaoh ants was obtained from Purdue University, Indiana, USA; research conducted in Belgium.]",

Protein marking and mark-release-recapture techniques were utilized to examine the effect of colony spatial structure on food dispersal. Sucrose water spiked with rabbit IgG protein was presented to colonies with varying spatial configurations in laboratory and field experiments. In monodomous lab colonies, the rate and extent of food dispersal was rapid due to a decrease in foraging area. In polydomous colonies, food dispersal was slower because conspecifics were forced to forage and share food over longer distances. However, over time, food was present in all extremities of the colony. Experiments conducted in the field produced similar results, with nests in close proximity to food yielding higher percentages of workers scoring positive for the marker. However, the percentage of workers possessing the marker decreased over time. Results from this study provide experimental data on mechanisms of food dispersal in monodomous and polydomous colonies of ants, and may be important for increasing the efficacy of management strategies against T. sessile and other pest ant species.",

    "abstract": "In cashew plantations of south west Karnataka, India, foraging activity of 49 ants species belonging to 24 genera and 7 subfamilies were recorded. The study found that ants visited cashew trees regularly throughout the year. Myrmicinae ants were most dominant comprising 22 species followed by Formicinae with 13 species while, among Aenictinae and Dorylinae, only single species was found. Species richness was high in old cashew plantations recording 89.8 % of total species, while medium and young plantations recorded only 46.9 and 24.5 %. Dominance of different ant species was noticed on cashew canopy, trunk and soil in different aged cashew plantations. Old cashew plantations were characterized by Oecophylla smaragdina, followed by Anoplolepis gracillipes, while, Camponotus compressus and C. sericeus were dominant in young and medium aged plantations. Pit fall trap collection consisted mostly of Odontomachus haematodus, Lophomyrmex quadrispinosus, Technomyrmex albipes, Myrmicaria brunnea, Diacamma sp., C. compressus and C. sericeus. During flowering and fruiting period of cashew, foraging of up to 10 ant species was seen on the same tree at a time. Activities of most ant species were predominant during winter and summer which coincides with flowering and fruiting period of cashew (December-May), while during heavy down pour of South West monsoon, activities of only 10 species were seen. A significant positive correlation was found between number of ant species and maximum air temperature (0.842) and also with afternoon soil temperature (0.925).          *[Meranoplus bicolor misspelled Meranoplus bicolour; Pseudomyrmecinae misspelled Pseudomyrmicinae;]",

The foraging pattern of the ant, Camponotus compressus Fabricius, on the honeydew secreted by these aphids was studied. The ants foraged in spatially non-random patterns. From any given point along the linear axis of the inflorescence, they tended to orient towards that part where they were more likely to encounter aphids. Analysis of the three-dimensional movement pattern of the ants showed they tended to explore the inflorescence systematically by visiting successive branches in their subsequent moves. They attained this by moving sinusoidally around the inflorescence axis. However, the ants concentrated their foraging effort in areas of high aphid density. Although this led to deviations from the systematic exploration of the inflorescence, it increased their foraging efficiency. There was a significant association between the numbers of aphids of any two randomly selected branches of an inflorescence indicating that the resource quality of a randomly chosen branch reflects that of the whole inflorescence. Using this association, ants could assess the quality of an inflorescence by sampling a part of it and accordingly decide whether or not to continue foraging on an inflorescence; they abandoned the inflorescence if the sampled branch was of poor quality and continued to forage if it was of good quality.",

They defend themselves from the homopteran-associated ants by means other than honey secretion.  Ants derive no benefit from the presence of the lycaenin larvae.  The larvae & pupae of these genera lack any sort of organ that yields an ant confection.  Ants that visit honey-secreting homopterans are hostile to the caterpillars.  However, these are protected against ants either by their obscure position among or beneath their host prey, by the thick cuticle on the dorsal body wall, or by their bristly vestiture.]",

In this study, we present the first species-level checklist of the 255 species (in 64 genera & 14 subfamilies) of ants currently known in Antioquia.  One hundred & fifty-two (152) species were previously registered for the state, & here, 103 additional species are recognized.  Most of these species are distributed in other bioregions of the country as well.  Forty-six% are present in the Amazon Province & 36% in the Colombian Orinoco River basin.  Less than 3% are found in the arid lands of the Colombian Caribbean area, Guyana, & the Colombian Pacific Province, plus the Caribbean islands.  Sixty-three% of the species are shared with Costa Rica.  Our checklist constitutes the largest roster of ants at the species level for a state in Colombia to date & constitutes the beginning of the assessment of ant diversity in Antioquia.  The following 13 species are new to the records for Colombia: Azteca diabolica, Camponotus amoris, C. eurynotus, C. pachylepis, C. propinquus, C. tonduzi, Cerapachys toltecus, Cylindromyrmex whymperi, Myrmicocrypta urichi, Pheidole angulifera, Pseudomyrmex lisus, Solenopsis subterranea, & Trachymyrmex zeteki.]",

For quantifying these associations in terms of overlapping & exclusion, spatial interspecific association analysis was carried out.  Between aphid & predator, & aphid & ant, partial overlapping was obtained.  Thus, although the association between aphid & predator was positive, it did not seem to be strong.  Between the aphid & ant was suggestive of mutualism, without obligate interdependence.  Moreover, the predator & ant showed a tendency to independent occurrence with respect to the aphid when the spatial correlations were calculated.

This is the first ethnozoological study in Pachamalai hills; the data regarding the medicinal animals/animal products were documented and their usages were analyzed quantitatively. Data was collected following the interviews from key informants (N=89) and reported diseases and health complications were classified in 18 categories. Seven quantitative indexes such as informant consensus factor (FIC), fidelity level (FL), relative frequency of citation (RFC), relative importance (RI), cultural importance index (CII), index of agreement on remedies (IAR) and cultural agreement index (CAI) were used to analyze the reported animal species. A total of 46 animal species belonging to 8 taxonomic groups were documented to be used in traditional medicine by Malayalis in Pachamalai hills. Animal based medicines were prepared from whole animals or their body parts or products extracted from them such as: butter, meat, milk, bones, horn, musk, skin, fin, honey, mucus, eggs, urine, excreta, hair and legs. The most encountered taxonomic group was Mammalia having 14 species. Aphrodisiac ailments (AA) (0.99), Dental care ailments (DCA) (0.99), Endocrinal disorders ailments (EDA) (0.99), Hair care ailments (HCA) (0.99), Oncology ailments (OA) (0.99) and Ortho ailments (ORTA) (0.99) gained the highest FIC value. Sus scrofa domesticus scored the highest FL (100%) for the Skeleto-muscular ailments for external cause; Lissemys punctata had the highest RI value (2.00) due to its versatility and the highest frequency of citation (RFC=1.000). Gallus domesticus had the highest cultural importance (CII=8.538) and the highest CAI value (CAI=8.427). According to IAR, Plexippus paykulli (IAR=1.00), Equus ferrus caballus (IAR=1.00), Trachypithecus johnii (IAR=1.00), Oecophylla smaragdina (IAR=1.00) and Apis indica (0.990) had the highest agreement among the informants for being used for the same medicinal purpose. Furthermore, no side effects have been reported from the use of ABT. Our study revealed that Malayalis (Pachamalai hills) possess valuable knowledge on MalayalisÛ animal based therapies. It is believed that the present documentation will serve to record this vanishing knowledge before it is eroded completely from the island and to the scientific community. It is also anticipated that the present documentation will be fundamental to protect traditional knowledge, for the conservation and sustainable use of the rich biodiversity of Pachamalai hills for future generations and to ensure Pachamalai hillsÛ sovereign rights over its genetic resources and utilization by first documenting them. In addition, further experimental investigations are required to elucidate the pharmacological properties of the reported medicinal fauna of Pachmalai hills.",

    "abstract": "Ants and jumping spiders are prominent invertebrate predators in terrestrial ecosystems. Many jumping spiders are thought to avoid ants and their ant mimicking spiders, yet little is known if they discriminate among different species of ants or mimics. Chances of encountering multiple ants, and mimics all in a relatively short stretch of time and space is fairly common in the tropics, but how all these species interact with each other is not known. In a laboratory setup, we first examined the behavioral response of three ant species (Oecophylla smaragdina, the weaver ants; Camponotus sericeus, the golden backed carpenter ants, and Leptogenys processionalis, the procession ants), and their mimics in the genus Myrmarachne towards the non-mimetic jumping spider Plexippus paykulli. We then examined the response of P paykulli towards the three ant species, and their mimics. Our results suggest that weaver ants and procession ants are more aggressive towards non-mimetic jumping spiders as compared to golden backed ants. The three mimics also differed in their response towards the non-mimetic jumping spider: both weaver ant mimics and golden backed ant mimics charged at the non-mimetic jumping spiders as compared to the procession ant mimics. On the other hand, P. paykulli did not treat all ants similarly: while they looked, and approached the black procession ants by visual cues, they stayed away from weaver ants and golden backed ants. However, P. paykulli treated the three ant mimicking spiders similarly: while they looked at the mimics, they rarely approached or attacked them. Jumping spiders and ants are sympatric, and it may be advantageous to selectively avoid some ants over others. Studies, such as ours go a step closer in understanding multispecies predator\u0013prey interactions.          *[The 3 species of mimics were, the weaver ant mimic (Myrmarachne plataleoides Cambridge 1869), golden backed ant mimic (Myrmarachne sp.), & a black mimic (Myrmarachne melanocephala MacLeay 1839).]",

Distinct variations in the guild structure of litter ant communities in shola & deciduous forests have been recorded.  Predators dominated deciduous & omnivores in the shola forests.  Cryptic species were the dominant functional guild in both litter stands, although hot-climate specialists have not been recorded from the shola forests.  Rank-abundance plots attributed the difference in diversity between the forests to the dominance of Tapinoma sp. & Myrmicaria brunnea in deciduous forest.

    "abstract": "*[We investigated the frequency of studies & collaborations across countries during 2015-2019, which simultaneously allowed us to estimate the most studied taxa.  We found that the largest proportion of studies was done in Europe & North America.  Collaboration trends were mainly among high-income countries.  Nearly 1/3 of the countries that served as sampling sites were not represented in authorship (mostly low- & middle-income).  Furthermore, low- & middle-income countries show a lower proportion of authorship or co-authorship, when these countries served as sampling sites, as compared with high-income countries.  This disparity might indicate scientific colonialism in the field.  However, collaborations between institutions from the sampling country & their foreign counterparts increased with the per capita Gross Domestic Product, suggesting a link between country's participation in international collaboration & its economic prosperity.  How publications are circulated may further influence trends in scientific colonialism.  Both the probability that a study reaches the public sphere (Altmetric) & the number of citations increase with the impact factor (IF) of the journal in which the article was published.  Unfortunately, high-IF journals often show the highest Article Processing Charges, which can be a financial impediment for institutions in low- & middle-income countries. Our study highlights factors that influence the process of research in this field.  The evidence of scientific colonialism in ant physiology, that we highlight in this study calls for urgent measures to promote more equitable collaborative efforts.]",

A study was conducted to compare relative attractiveness of seeds from several forbs used for roadside beautification in Oklahoma.

RIFA in a field in southeastern Oklahoma preferred seeds of Echinacea pupurea (purple coneflower) more than those of Monarda citriodora (lemon mint), Rudbeckia hirta (black-eyed susan), and GailIardia pulchella (indian blanket); they showed a negligible interest in Coreopsis tinctoria (plains cofeopsis), Rudbeckia amplexicaulis (claspingleafed coneflower), Coreopsis lanceolata (lance coreopsis), and Lupinus texensis (Texas bluebonnet).   Preferences of RIFA for consuming and/or dispersing different seeds may affect the relative species composition of natural areas and have an impact on the use of seedlings for reclamation.

From the Oriental region, there are currently 9 species belonging to the L. chinensis group. The group is diagnosed by having edentate masticatory margin of the mandible, smooth body surface, elongate antennae and metallic green cuticle. The species included are: L. assamensis; L. chinensis; L. confucii; L. kraepelini; L. laeviterga; L. pangui; L. peuqueti; L. stenocheilos and L. sunzii. Leptogenys bhartii sp. n., a new ponerine ant species from Western Himalayas, India, is described and illustrated based on the worker caste. The new species belongs to the Leptogenys chinensis group and mostly resembles Leptogenys chinensis (Mayr, 1870). In the L. chinensis group, the original description of L.  stenocheilos is insufficient as it lacks information about type material. As there is no further detailing of this species in the available literature, it is difficult to ascertain its valid status Xu and He (2015) and is therefore, considered a species inquirenda herewith.

    "abstract": "*[Species delimitation in the Palearctic Tetramorium caespitum species complex (formerly Tetramorium caespitum/impurum complex) has stayed ambiguous over a century. Using 1428 nest samples in an in-depth integrative-taxonomy approach, we revise the European species of the complex. Unsupervised analyses provide independent species hypotheses based on molecular & morphological disciplines. Following the unified species concept, we show the presence of 10 clearly distinguishable European species differing in mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, morphology of workers & males, & ecology. We explain the evolution of the observed mitochondrial-nuclear discordances by peripatric speciation, historical introgression, & recent hybridization, & that of morphological-nuclear discordances by interspecific similarity & intraspecific variability, that is, morphological crypsis. Based on the final species hypotheses, we confirm T. caespitum (Linnaeus, 1758), T. impurum (Foerster, 1850), T. indocile Santschi, 1927, T. hungaricum Rˆszler, 1935, & T. alpestre Steiner, Schlick-Steiner & Seifert, 2010 as good species. We raise T. fusciclava Consani & Zangheri, 1952 stat.n., T. staerckei KratochvÌl, 1944 sp.rev., & T. immigrans Santschi, 1927 stat.n. (as an introduced species also in the Americas) to species rank & synonymize T. semilaeve var. kutteri Santschi, 1927 under T. indocile & T. staerckei var. gregori KratochvÌl, 1941 under T. impurum. Finally, we newly describe T. breviscapus sp.n. & T. caucasicum sp.n. We present dichotomous determination keys to workers & males & make freely available an online identification key to workers at https://webapp.uibk.ac.at/ecology/tetramorium/ . Of relevance to resolving other highly complicated taxonomic problems, we highlight that no single data type was sufficient to disentangle the final species boundaries, which underlines the importance of integrating multiple data sources in taxonomy.]",

    "abstract": "*[... It frequents sandy districts and places where 'red earth' is found, but is absent from the 'black earth' or the rich alluvial soil of the Amazon.  It forms its nests in the woods and in gardens, turning up the soil in such large heaps as to make one doubt whether so small an insect could have been the workman.   I have seen elevations of this kind 20 feet square and a yard high, containing many tons of earth.  These hillocks are riddled with holes in every direction, and into them the ants may be seen dragging little circular pieces of leaf, which they cut off from particular trees which they prefer; orange trees and leguminous shrubs suffer most from their ravages, and these they will sometimes entirely strip of their leaves in a night or 2.  Young plants too of every kind suffer very much, and cannot be grown in many places on account of them.  They remain in one locality a long time; for on my observing to a gentleman at a cattle estate near Para how remarkably the track of these ants was worn down across a pathway and through grass, he informed me that he had observed them marching along that very track for 15 or 20 years.  The insects that do this are of course the neuters, which have tremendous jaws.  They often swarm in houses at night, crawling over the supper table and carrying away fragments of bread and farina....          It is the female of this destructive creature that furnishes the Indian with a luxurious repast.  At a certain season the insects come out of their holes in such numbers, that they are caught by basketsfull.  When this takes place in the neighbourhood of an Indian village all is stir and excitement; the young men, women and children go out to catch sa¸bas with baskets and calabashes, which they soon fill; for though the female ants have wings, they are very sluggish and seldom or never fly.  The part eaten is the abdomen, which is very rich and fatty from the mass of undeveloped eggs.  They are eaten alive; the insect being held by the head as we hold a strawberry by its stalk, and the abdomen being bitten off, the body, wings and legs are thrown down on the floor, where they continue to crawl along apparently unaware of the loss of their posterior extremities.  They are kept in calabashes or bottle-shaped baskets, the mouths of which are stopped up with a few leaves, and it is rather a singular sight to see for the first time an Indian taking his breakfast in the sa¸ba season. He opens the basket, and as the great-winged ants crawl slowly out, he picks them up carefully and transfers them with alternate handfuls of farina to his mouth.  When great quantities are caught, they are slightly roasted or smoked, with a little salt sprinkled among them, and are then generally much liked by Europeans.]",

Fushun amber is derived from cupressaceous trees.  Twenty-two orders & more than 80 families of arthropods have been reported so far, making it among the most diverse amber biotas.  Our results reveal that an apparent radiation of ecological keystone insects, including eusocial, phytophagous, & parasitoid lineages, occurred at least during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum.  Some insect taxa have close phylogenetic affinities to those from coeval European ambers, showing a biotic interchange between the eastern & western margins of the Eurasian landmass during the Early Paleogene.]",

    "abstract": "The red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis, is endemic to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean and largely responsible for shaping the unique ecosystem found throughout the island's rainforests. However, the introduction and establishment of supercolonies of the highly invasive yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes, has decimated red crab numbers over the last several decades. This poses a significant risk to the future conservation of G. natalis and consequently threatens the integrity of the unique island ecosystem. Here we undertook a population genetic analysis of G. natalis using a combination of 11 microsatellite markers and sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene from samples collected on Christmas Island as well as a single location from North Keeling Island (located approximately 900 km west of Christmas Island). The genetic results indicate that G. natalis is a single panmictic population on Christmas Island, with no spatial genetic structure or restricted gene flow apparent between sampled locations. Further, G. natalis from North Keeling Island are not genetically distinct and are recent immigrants from Christmas Island. The effective population size of G. natalis has likely remained large and stable on Christmas Island throughout its evolutionary history with relatively moderate to high levels of genetic diversity in microsatellite loci and mitochondrial haplotypes assessed in this study. For management purposes G. natalis can be considered a single panmictic population, which should simplify conservation efforts for the genetic management of this iconic island species.",

With the new records, Labidus coecus has now been reported from 20 countries in Central and South America (all except Chile), three West Indian islands (Margarita, Trinidad, and Tobago), and four US states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas). The range of Labidus coecus appears to be essentially continuous, from Buenos Aires, Argentina in the south (~34.6∞S) to Delaware County, Oklahoma in the north (~36.6∞N). The three West Indian islands with Labidus coecus populations are all continental shelf islands that were connected to South America during periods of lower sea levels a few thousand years ago, so Labidus coecus populations on these islands have only recently become isolated. Labidus coecus commonly nests in caves, a microhabitat that may allow it to live in regions with otherwise inhospitable climates.

In the past few years, however, A. gracilipes has been brought to world attention due to its deadly attacks on nesting birds in the Seychelles & on the endemic crabs of Christmas Island.  To evaluate the distribution & potential spread of A. gracilipes, I compiled & mapped specimen records from more than 700 sites worldwide.  In tropical Asia & tropical islands of the Indian & Pacific Oceans, A. gracilipes occurs throughout the moist lowlands, but is not commonly found in arid regions & sites above 1200 m elevation.  In tropical Africa, it is known only from Dar es Salaam & nearby Zanzibar.  In tropical Australia, A. gracilipes has been recorded primarily from moist monsoon rainforests along perennial springs & streams in the northern region & in a few towns on the North & East coasts.  In the Neotropics, there are records of A. gracilipes from western Mexico.  In subtropical Asia, A. gracilipes ranges up to 26-27-degrees-N in northern India, southern China, & southern islands of Japan.  I found only 6 records from latitudes more-than 27-degrees, 2 from exterminated urban populations (Auckland, New Zealand; Brisbane, Australia) & 3 from probably temporary populations (ValparaÌso, Chile; Durban, South Africa; Zayul, Tibet).  The sixth population, on Amami-Oshima Island, Japan, may or may not be temporary.  Anoplolepis gracilipes is not yet known from many moist lowland tropical areas, where it would probably thrive, including West-central Africa & much of the Neotropics. Populations in western Mexico are prevented from expanding eastward by a central mountain range, but may be able to spread South, around the mountains, to the Caribbean, Central America, & South America.  Records from arid Baja California, Mexico indicate that A. gracilipes can invade & persist in areas with arid climates, perhaps due to moderating effects of irrigation.]",

I documented the earliest known P. longicornis records for 181 geographic areas, including many for which I found no previously published records (Anguilla, Argentina, Austral Islands, Bahrain, British Indian Ocean Territory, Cayman Islands, Comoro Islands, Dominica, East Timor, El Salvador, Gambia, Ghana, Gibraltar, Guatemala, Iles Eparses, Kenya, Maldives, Mali, Montserrat, Nepal, Nevis, Pakistan, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu, Maryland, Missouri, Virginia).  Paratrechina longicornis is arguably the most broadly dispersed of all ant species, distributed widely across the Old World & New World in both the northern & southern hemispheres.  The successful worldwide spread of P. longicornis relates to its ability to flourish in highly disturbed & artificial environments, including ships at sea.  P. longicornis records are most frequent near major commercial waterways, I expect that with the increasing importance of air transport, P. longicornis will spread to more inland areas as well.  Many P. longicornis records, including most if not all records from temperate latitudes, come from inside or near buildings.  Because P. longicornis can live indoors anywhere that humans live, there is no limit to the latitude where it could thrive.  The worldwide distribution records of P. longicornis & 2 species-specific symbionts provide ambiguous clues to the original native range of P. longicornis.

In the New World, where this species is certainly exotic, there are published P. teneriffana records only from California, Cuba, and Peru. The first records from 11 West Indian islands presented here, all from 2003 or later, suggest that P. teneriffana is actively spreading through this region.

This ant is also common in villages and cities, where it is well known for its powerful sting that sometimes leads to anaphylactic shock in humans & even death.  Recent first reports of P. sennaarensis from subtropical parts of the Arabian Peninsula & Iran have led many researchers to conclude that populations of this ant are expanding.  To evaluate this possibility, I compiled & mapped specimen records of  P. sennaarensis from more-than 300 sites.  I documented the earliest known P. sennaarensis records for 40 countries, including several for which I found no previously published records: Bahrain, Chad, India, Liberia, Mozambique, & Zambia.  In 1925, when most of the world's ant fauna was still poorly documented, P. sennaarensis had already been collected from widely scattered locales in 26 countries across tropical Africa & Arabia.  In addition, there is a single isolated 1896 record of P. sennaarensis from an apparently temporary population in tropical India.  All P. sennaarensis records from subtropical sites north of 23.4-degrees-N (in Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, & Saudi Arabia) are from after 1950, except one record from just outside the tropics (Muscat, Oman; 23.6-degrees-N).  It is possible that P. sennaarensis populations have lived in these subtropical areas for a long time, but are only now being reported, perhaps due to a recent population increase of this species.  In fact, although the earliest specimen record from Iran dates to 2001, older residents of SE Iran remember the sting of P. sennaarensis from their childhood.  Still, it is possible that P. sennaarensis has really expanded its geographic range northeastward into new regions during the past few decades.]",

All populations of S. globularia outside the New World are probably exotic, introduced through human commerce, including populations on Atlantic islands (Ascension, Cabo Verde, St Helena), Pacific islands (Hawaii, French Polynesia, Philippines), & Africa (Congo, Ivory Coast, Senegal).  On the Cabo Verde islands, off the coast of West Africa, S. globularia is extremely widespread on all 9 inhabited islands.

    "abstract": "The Neotropical carpenter ant Camponotus sexguttatus (Fabricius) has widespread records from the West Indies, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Across its broad native range, C. sexguttatus shows great variation, most notably in color, ranging from almost black to pale yellow. Non-native populations of C. sexguttatus were recorded for the first time in Florida in 1993, and in the Bahamas in 1995. Here, I examine the known native and non-native geographic distribution of C. sexguttatus. I compiled and mapped C. sexguttatus specimen records from >850 sites, including my own records from 583 sites. Camponotus sexguttatus has West Indian range from Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands in the Greater Antilles through all major islands of the Lesser Antilles. On at least ten islands of the Lesser Antilles, two distinctly different C. sexguttatus color morphs coexist, the typical dark brown/black form plus a lighter form, suggesting that there are at least two separate lines of C. sexguttatus on these islands. Light forms have been previously described on four of these islands as three different subspecies. Camponotus sexguttatus has a continental range from Mexico, through Central America, to subtropical parts of Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. Records from the northern parts of this range, however, are very sparse, e.g., just a single record each from Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras, and no records from El Salvador. In addition to the typical C. sexguttatus sexguttatus, seven currently valid subspecies have been described from South America. Genetic analyses should examine whether the different subspecific forms in the West Indies and South America should be considered distinct species. In its non-native range in peninsular Florida, C. sexguttatus is now known from 16 counties (Brevard, Broward, Collier, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach, and St Lucie), where it is often one of the most common and conspicuous arboreal ants. Variation among C. sexguttatus populations in Florida suggest that they descend from introductions from at least two different source populations. In Bahamas, there are just five records of C. sexguttatus, all from New Providence. It is likely that C. sexguttatus will continue to spread in Florida and the Bahamas, possibly impacting both native and non-native arboreal ants.",

This species arrived by ship in Mobile, Alabama in the 1930s and has since spread across much of the southern USA. Beginning in 1981, S. invicta has been reported from a growing number of West Indian islands, including Puerto Rico (1981), the Virgin Islands (1988), the Bahamas (1993), Antigua (2000), Caicos Islands (2001), Anguilla (2006), St Martin (2006), Barbuda (2007), Montserrat (2007), Nevis (2007), St Kitts (2007), Aruba (2007), and Jamaica (2010). In the present study, we examined the status of S. invicta on the island of Trinidad. Although the first published record of S. invicta in Trinidad dates to 2000, we have reliable records of this species from sugarcane and rice growing areas of west-central Trinidad dating to 1991 and specimens collected in 1993. In 2003-2004, we surveyed ants at sites all over Trinidad to document the distribution of S. invicta and its congener, Solenopsis geminata. We collected S. invicta at 60 sites, all in west-central Trinidad. In contrast, we collected Solenopsis geminata at 158 sites spread across all 7 counties of Trinidad. The highest densities S. invicta populations occurred in County Caroni, with scattered populations extending into disturbed areas of County St. George to the north and east, and County Victoria to the south. As of 2004, S. invicta occupied ~10% of the island, but we see no reason why this species will not spread throughout most open, disturbed sites in Trinidad, displacing S. geminata as the dominant fire ant on the island.",

    "abstract": "On West Indian islands, as elsewhere in the world, ants are a very important component of virtually every terrestrial ecosystem. Nonetheless, the ants of most West Indian islands have remained largely unknown and unstudied. Now several destructive exotic ant species are spreading through the region, threatening native biodiversity. Here, we have compiled published and unpublished ant records and collected new specimens to document the diversity of ants on the island of Grenada. Our investigations increased the list of ant taxa known from the island to 82 (65 New World and 17 Old World species). Of these, 71 species are represented among specimens we collected, whereas 11 are New World species known from Grenada solely on the basis of earlier records. Some species recorded earlier, including at least nine not seen for more than 100 years, may now be extinct on Grenada. Grenada has more New World ant species than are known for Barbados (46), a neighboring island that has 34% more land area. Factors that may contribute to this difference include: 1) during low sea levels 15,000 years ago, Grenada was part of a larger island about 10 times Grenada's current size; 2) Grenada is more mountainous than Barbados; and 3) Grenada has more remaining forest cover than Barbados (50.0% vs. 14.7%). Conversely, Grenada has fewer Old World ant species than are known for Barbados (24). Factors that may contribute to this difference include: 1) lower human population density, 2) lower levels of imported lumber products, and 3) lower tourism levels. Records for only four of the 17 Old World exotic ants found in Grenada date to before 1995. Major tramp ant species that are known from the West Indies but have not yet been recorded from Grenada include Old World species such as the pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis), the African big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala), and the difficult white-footed ant (Technomyrmex difficilis), as well as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta).          *[Previously reported New World ants of Grenada not collected in present study: Cephalotes pallens, Crematogaster laevis bruesi, Leptogenys arcuata, Leptogenys pubiceps, Nesomyrmex clavipilis, Pachycondyla harpax, Pseudomyrmex flavidulus, Pseudomyrmex simplex, Pseudomyrmex termitarius, Thaumatomyrmex, Wasmannia sigmoidea.]",

    "abstract": "Higher hymenopteran vitellogenin/vitellin have been characterized as containing one large apoprotein. We show that in the ant subfamily Ponerinae, species in the tribes Odontomachini, Platythyrini, and Amblyoponini, also have a vitellin with this simple structure, containing a single apoprotein of 180-190 kDa. Species in tribes Ponerini and Ectatommini, however, have vitellin containing multiple subunits. The size and number of the subunits varies, with differences even among species within the same genus. This is the first report of diversity in vitellogenin structure in the higher Hymenoptera. Vitellin and vitellogenin in Harpegnathos saltator (Ponerini) contain two large subunits of about 165 kDa and two small subunits of about 45 and 43 kDa. N-terminal sequence analysis suggests that provitellogenin is cleaved at two different sites, producing two large and two small subunits differing slightly in size. Diversity of  vitellin types in Ponerini and Ectatommini is similar to that found in the more primitive tenthredinoid sawflies (Hymenoptera, Symphyta), and may indicate polyphyly in the Ponerinae. Insect vitellogenins and yolk proteins show considerably more diversity than originally believed, and the possibility of the functional significance of these differences should be considered.          *[List of species studied on p. 288 says 2 genera of Myrmicinae, but lists 6 species in 5 genera.  Figure 7 gives vitellin patterns for Pheidole rhea which is not listed on p. 288; figure caption lists Cs = Camponotus sayi, figure shows Ca.]",

This species is most similar morphologically to P. darlena Williams & LaPolla 2016, P. fisheri Bharti & Wachkoo 2012, P. fustinoda Williams & LaPolla 2016, P. nepalensis Williams & LaPolla 2018, & P. shanialena Williams & LaPolla 2016.  The geographical distributions of these 6 similar species are concentrated around montane areas of South & Southeast Asia, including The Himalayas in Nepal & northern India.  Similar morphology suggests that these 6 species together form a high elevation clade.  A re-evaluation of the literature & distribution records confirms there are presently 4 species known to Nepal, 2 of which are likely endemic: P. nepalensis & P. rinpoche.  Most Prenolepis species, including P. rinpoche, are found at elevations above 1200 meters, suggesting an evolutionary pathway to temperate climate adaptation & winter activity in species such as P. imparis Say (1836) in the Nearctic & P. nitens Mayr (1853) in the Palearctic.]          *[Ants other than Prenolepis were used as outgroups, listed in Supplementary Table S1.]",

A key for the worker caste is provided, & the worker of each species is imaged, with males & queens imaged in species where they are known.  Worker-based characters were used to construct a species-level phylogeny of Prenolepis.  Both maximum parsimony & Bayesian inference methods were used for the phylogenetic analyses.  A morphological diagnosis for the genus is provided, with a discussion of useful morphological characters for separating Prenolepis from other genera in the Prenolepis genus-group.

    "abstract": "Invasive species have devastating economic and ecological impacts worldwide, but proactive monitoring programs are rare on the global stage. By definition, tramp ants are associated with disturbance and human-mediated dispersal, making them especially concerning invasive threats. A proactive\u0014rather than reactive\u0014approach to monitoring for, preventing, and managing invasive species depends on taxonomic preparedness, which enables rapid and accurate identification. Emerging tools and technologies, including genomic barcoding and interactive online keys, can aid in species delimitation and diagnosis. However, resolving tramp species' identities remains the fundamental first step in invasive species management because diagnostic tools cannot be developed and disseminated until species names are stable. Diagnosis of morphologically difficult species requires basic knowledge of species boundaries, biogeography, and phylogenetic relationships. This review comprehensively synthesizes information available for 15 known and five potential tramp ant species in Nylanderia (Emery) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae): a globally distributed genus of over 130 described species, many of which are only diagnosable by subtle morphological characters. Nylanderia records were drawn from published literature, specimen databases, and museum collections to compile known distributions, biology, natural history, and taxonomy for each species. We review existing resources for visualizing known geographic ranges and high-resolution images of ants globally and encourage the use of these types of tools in support of invasive species diagnosis and distribution tracking. Finally, we discuss how taxonomic and life history information can be used synergistically with genomic and digital technology to develop tools for identification of these, and other emerging invasive insect species.",

    "abstract": "The ant genus Nylanderia Emery has a cosmopolitan distribution and includes 150 extant described species and subspecies, with potentially hundreds more undescribed. Global taxonomic revision has long been stalled by strong intra- and interspecific morphological variation, limited numbers of diagnostic characters, and dependence on infrequently collected male specimens for species description and identification. Taxonomy is further complicated by Nylanderia being one of the most frequently intercepted ant genera at ports of entry worldwide, and at least 15 globetrotting species have widespread and expanding ranges, making species-level diagnoses difficult. Three species complexes ('bourbonica complex', 'fulva complex', and 'guatemalensis complex') include globetrotting species. To elucidate the phylogenetic positions of these three complexes and delimit species boundaries within each, we used target enrichment of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from 165 specimens representing 98 Nylanderia morphospecies worldwide. We also phased the UCEs, effectively doubling sample size and increasing population-level sampling. After recovering strong support for the monophyly of each complex, we extracted COI barcodes and SNPs from the UCE data and tested within-complex morphospecies hypotheses using three molecular delimitation methods (SODA, bPTP, and STACEY). This comparison revealed that most methods tended to over-split taxa, but results from STACEY were most consistent with our morphospecies hypotheses. Using these results, we recommend species boundaries that are conservative and most congruent across all methods. This work emphasizes the importance of integrative taxonomy for invasive species management, as globetrotting occurs independently across at least nine different lineages across Nylanderia..  This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time and is therefore in the public domain.          *[A classic example of this in ants (cryptic invasions) is the misidentification of the tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius), as the red-imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Wetterer 2013, 2011), in Malaysia & Singapore, and possibly elsewhere (e.g., India, the Philippines). .. In this case, the inability to correctly identify S. geminata meant that its distribution was underestimated & the invaded range of S. invicta was overestimated.]",

    "abstract": "Because social parasites are relatively rare in tropical ant faunas, new or poorly known forms deserve special attention. Two Pheidole species evidently parasitic on P. indica are here described as new species from India (P. lanuginosa, P. parasitica), while a previously known northern South American form, P. microgyna Wheeler, is redescribed and evaluated as a possible parasite of P. minutula or a closely related host species.  Next, all of the nine certain or likely social parasites of Pheidole known worldwide are compared, and an anatomical parasitic syndrome is identified through character state analysis. The nine species appear to be independently evolved. the parasitic character states have tended to evolve within each of these species at different rates, and hence the evolution is interpreted as having been not only parallel among species but mosaic in nature within species (see table I). In spite of the lesser irregularities in this pattern, an overall trend is evident: the first changes to occur were loss of the worker caste (a loss still incomplete in the overall slightly modified P. inquilina), reduction of size, lengthening of the scape, reduction of sculpturing on the body surface, and broadening of the postpetiole. These shifts were followedby reduction of the mandibles and the segments of the funiculus.  The genera Anergatides and Bruchomyrma, each based on a single extremely advanced species, are placed in synonymy under Pheidole. The problematic genera Hagioxenus, parapheidole, and Sifolinia are compared with Pheidole and their status evaluated. The greater known diversity of parasitic ants in the temperate zones, as compared with the tropics, remains a key problem in the study of ant evolution. Whether the difference is genuine or an artifact of differential sampling cannot be determined until more intensive collecting is undertaken in the tropics.     *[Pheidole neokohli Wilson, a workerless ant that parasitizes colonies of Pheidole megacephala melancholica in Africa.]",

Despite the large quantities of honeydew produced by West Indian canefly & yellow sugarcane aphid, we observed no tending by S. invicta; however substantial predation on these insects was observed.   S. invicta tended rusty plum aphid & pink sugarcane mealybug, but no predation was observed.  S. invicta were observed on 35 to 50% of the nodes with pink sugarcane mealybug colonies.  This association was significant on each of 5 collection dates.  Lower nodes without adhering leafsheaths accounted for most of the nodes without pink sugarcane mealybug, & these nodes had no associated ants.  Ants were most frequently observed foraging in the upper parts of the stalk.  In a study where pyrethroid insecticides used for borer management caused a flare-up of yellow sugarcane aphid (8-fold increase), corresponding season long fire ant abundance measured by pitfall traps increased 2.5-fold over untreated plots.  Unlike specialist predators & parasitoids that have a lagged response to pest species buildup, the generalist feeding behavior of S. invicta & the presence of a constant source of carbohydrates, oneydew, seems to increase the stability of the sugarcane agroecosystem.  These data confirm that mealybugs may be an important determinant of S. invicta foraging behavior in the canopy of sugarcane & could influence their subsequent predation on the major pest, the sugarcane borer.]",

We update the status of S. invicta in Australia, China and Taiwan and discuss the invasion threat posed to other countries in the region, including India, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. An analysis of the manner of spread and responses by governments to the invasion reveals some important lessons: (a) S. invicta can be eradicated if detected early enough, (b) there has been a level of unpreparedness and under\u0010resourcing of quarantine agencies in some countries to deal with the pest, (c) strict controls on the movement of products likely to harbor S. invicta are essential in preventing or slowing the spread of the pest and has a major influence on the success or failure of eradication efforts and (d) a coordinated agency response is necessary to prevent treatment failure. Currently, cargo container traffic is the main mechanism for movement of S. invicta around the world and can only be addressed by international collaboration. Given the recent fire ant propagule pressure on Japan and South Korea via container traffic from China, it is likely that China may be a new bridgehead for the invasion of its neighbors in Asia and beyond.",

Our investigation redefines Amblyopone Erichson sensu Brown (1960), here referred to as Amblyopone sensu lato, into 3 genera: Xymmer Santschi stat.rev., Amblyopone sensu stricto, Stigmatomma Roger stat.rev.  All species names under Amblyopone s.l. reassign into Xymmer & Amblyopone s.s., which are small, well-defined genera, & Stigmatomma, a large group with a generic delimitation that still needs further refinement.  Based on a study of male mandible characters & our scenario for mandibular evolution of the worker caste within Amblyopone s.l, we conclude that Amblyopone s.s. nests outside of XMAS (Xymmer+Mystrium+Adetomyrma+Stigmatomma) clade.

    "abstract": "Throughout lowland Amazonia, arboreal ants collect seeds of specific plants and cultivate them in nutrient-rich nests, forming diverse yet obligate and species-specific symbioses called Neotropical ant-gardens (AGs). The ants depend on their symbiotic plants for nest stability, and the plants depend on AGs for substrate and nutrients. Although the AGs are limited to specific participants, it is unknown at what stage specificity arises, and seed fate pathways in AG epiphytes are undocumented. Here we examine the specificity of the ant-seed interaction by comparing the ant community observed at general food baits to ants attracted to and removing seeds of the AG plant Peperomia macrostachya. We also compare seed removal rates under treatments that excluded vertebrates, arthropods, or both. In the bait study, only three of 70 ant species collected P. macrostachya seeds, and 84% of observed seed removal by ants was attributed to the AG ant Camponotus femoratus. In the exclusion experiment, arthropod exclusion significantly reduced seed removal rates, but vertebrate exclusion did not. We provide the most extensive empirical evidence of species specificity in the AG mutualism and begin to quantify factors that affect seed fate in order to understand conditions that favor its departure from the typical diffuse model of plant-animal mutualism.",

Previous studies had shown that S. invicta would selectively prey on brown citrus aphids (Toxoptera citricida) parasitized by Lipolexis oregmae and Asian citrus psyllids (Diaphorina citri) parasitized by Tamarixia radiata, which led us to question whether S. invicta would selectively prey on citrus leafminer (CLM) larvae or eggs parasitized by A. citricola.  In the laboratory trial, there was no significant difference between the type of CLM larvae preyed on. However, higher predation was observed on parasitized CLM larvae reared on potted plants in a citrus grove. A subsequent citrus grove test revealed slightly, although not significantly, lower levels of parasitism by A. citricola in trees to which ants had access because predation by ants was higher. However, predation by other predators in the trees to which ants had no access resulted in no significant differences in CLM densities in the two treatments. The field data provide, for the first time, the seasonal phenology of the CLM and its parasitoid A. citricola in the Indian River region of Florida in an unsprayed grapefruit block.",

    "abstract": "Field experiments were conducted to measure the effects of four commonly used turfgrass insecticides (isofenphos, diazinon, imidacloprid, halofenozide) on white grubs (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and ant predators of white grub eggs. Ant populations were measured over time with canned tuna, whereas predation by the ants was measured with artificially placed Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, eggs. The effectiveness of each insecticide at controlling Japanese beetle grubs, when applied at different times during the growing season, also was measured. Isofenphos and diazinon significantly reduced both ant numbers and white grub egg predation, whereas imidacloprid and one halofenozide treatment did not significantly impact either measurement. A second halofenozide treatment significantly reduced white grub egg predation. Isofenphos and diazinon were ineffective at controlling Japanese beetle grubs when applied in June but were highly efficacious when applied in August. Evidence of enhanced biodegradation was found in plots that received both June and August applications of diazinon.  Both June and August applications of imidacloprid and halofenozide provided good control of white grubs.          *[In this study ants, Solenopsis molesta (Say), was responsible for up to 83% of white grub egg predation in turfgrass soil.]",

Ants are a highly successful family of insects that thrive in a variety of habitats across the world. Perhaps their best-known features are complex social organization and strict division of labor, separating reproduction from the day-to-day maintenance and care of the colony, as well as strict discrimination against foreign individuals. Since these social characteristics in ants are thought to be mediated by semiochemicals, a thorough analysis of these signals, and the receptors that detect them, is critical in revealing mechanisms that lead to stereotypic behaviors. To address these questions, we have defined and characterized the major chemoreceptor families in a pair of behaviorally and evolutionarily distinct ant species, Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator. Through comprehensive re-annotation, we show that these ant species harbor some of the largest yet known repertoires of odorant receptors (Ors) among insects, as well as a more modest number of gustatory receptors (Grs) and variant ionotropic glutamate receptors (Irs). Our phylogenetic analyses further demonstrate remarkably rapid gains and losses of ant Ors, while Grs and Irs have also experienced birth-and-death evolution to different degrees. In addition, comparisons of antennal transcriptomes between sexes identify many chemoreceptors that are differentially expressed between males and females and between species. We have also revealed an agonist for a worker-enriched OR from C. floridanus, representing the first case of a heterologously characterized ant tuning Or. Collectively, our analysis reveals a large number of ant chemoreceptors exhibiting patterns of differential expression and evolution consistent with sex/species-specific functions. These differentially expressed genes are likely associated with sex-based differences, as well as the radically different social lifestyles observed between C. floridanus and H. saltator, and thus are targets for further functional characterization. Our findings represent an important advance toward understanding the molecular basis of social interactions and the differential chemical ecologies among ant species.          *[The automated genome annotations of C. floridanus & H. saltator revealed about 100 Or & about 10 Gr genes, which is substantially fewer than the number of Or & Gr genes in 2 other sequenced ant genomes (e.g. argentine ant: Linepithema humile, & harvester ant: Pogonomyrmex barbatus.  Samples originated from C. floridanus colonies that had been founded in the Liebig lab from queens captured in S Florida between 2002 & 2009, & from H. saltator colonies collected in Karnataka, India between 1995 & 1999.]",
