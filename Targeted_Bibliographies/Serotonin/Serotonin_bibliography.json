    "abstract": "*[This study investigated an aminergic mechanism underlying defensive responses to unexpected touch in an ant that has powerful mandibles, a trap-jaw ant.  Tactile stimulation to the abdomen elicited quick forward movements in a dart escape in 90% of the ants in a colony.  Less than 10% of the ants responded with a quick defensive turn towards the source of stimulation.  To reveal the neuronal mechanisms underlying this defensive behavior, the effect of brain biogenic amines on the responses to tactile stimuli were investigated.  The levels of octopamine, dopamine, & serotonin in the brain were significantly elevated in ants that responded with a defensive turn to the unexpected stimulus compared with ants that responded with a dart escape.  Oral administration of dopamine & serotonin demonstrated that both amines contributed to the initiation of a defensive response.  Oral administration of l-DOPA weakly affected the initiation of the defensive turn, while 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan strongly affected the initiation of defensive behavior.  Oral administration of ketanserin, a serotonin antagonist, inhibited the initiation of the defensive turn in aggressive workers, eliminating the effects of both serotonin & 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan on the initiation of turn responses.]",

Dopamine in the brain of virgin females increased from 552 +/- 42 to 971 +/- 65 fMol/brain when reproduction and dealation were stimulated by 15 days of separation. Octopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine did not change significantly after the separation. Isolated virgin females fed with a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor 3-iodo-L-tyrosine mixed in sucrose for 15 days laid significantly fewer eggs and had fewer chorionated oocytes in their ovarioles than females fed with sucrose only. Restoring dopamine biosynthesis by adding L-dopa to the food also restored oogenesis and oviposition. Dealation was not affected by 3-iodo-L-tyrosine or L-dopa. The possible role of dopamine as the neural target of the queen pheromone regarding its potent allotoregulatory effect in other insects is discussed.",

Octopamine reduced trophallaxis in these workers as well as hydrocarbon transfer between nestmates, but not hydrocarbon biosynthesis.  Administration of serotonin to such 5-day-isolated ants had no effect on the percentage of trophallaxis.  Administration of phentolamine alone, an octopamine antagonist, had no effect, but when co-administrated with octopamine, it reduced the effect of octopamine alone & restored trophallaxis to control levels.

The present study investigates the neurochemistry of the queenless ant species, Streblognathus peetersi, to better understand the neural basis of the high behavioural plasticity observed in queenless ants. We report measurements of brain biogenic amines [octopamine, dopamine, serotonin] of S. peetersi ants; they reveal a new set of biogenic amine influences on social organisation with no common features with other 'primitively organised societies' (bumble bees) and some common features with 'highly eusocial' species (honey bees). This similarity to honey bees may either confirm the heritage of queenless species from their probably highly eusocial ancestors or highlight independent patterns of biogenic amine influences on the social organisation of these highly derived species.",

    "abstract": "Feeding behaviour is a complex functional system that relies on external signals and the physiological state of the animal. This is also the case in ants as they vary their feeding behaviour according to food characteristics, environmental conditions and - as they are social insects - to the colony's requirements. The biogenic amine serotonin (5-HT) was shown to be involved in the control and modulation of many actions and processes related to feeding in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In this study, we investigated whether 5-HT affects nectar feeding in ants by analysing its effect on the sucking-pump activity. Furthermore, we studied 5-HT association with tissues and neuronal ganglia involved in feeding regulation. Our results show that 5-HT promotes a dose-dependent depression of sucrose feeding in Camponotus mus ants. Orally administered 5-HT diminished the intake rate by mainly decreasing the volume of solution taken per pump contraction, without modifying the sucrose acceptance threshold. Immunohistochemical studies all along the alimentary canal revealed 5-HT-like immunoreactive processes on the foregut (oesophagus, crop and proventriculus), while the midgut and hindgut lacked 5-HT innervation. Although the frontal and suboesophageal ganglia contained 5-HT immunoreactive cell bodies, serotonergic innervation in the sucking-pump muscles was absent. The results are discussed in the frame of a role of 5-HT in feeding control in ants.",

Moreover, the introduction process itself has been hypothesised to act as a selective filter for traits that promote invasiveness. We tested the hypothesis that behaviours thought to promote invasiveness - such as increased foraging activity and aggression - are selected for during invasion by comparing traits among native and introduced populations of the widespread Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). We studied Argentine ant populations in the native range in Argentina and in three invaded regions along an introduction pathway: California, Australia and New Zealand. In each region, we set up 32 experimental colonies to measure foraging activity and interspecific aggression in a subset of the study regions. These colonies were subject to experimental manipulation of carbohydrate availability and octopamine, a biogenic amine known to modulate behaviour in insects, to measure variation in behavioural plasticity. We found variation in foraging activity among populations, but this variation was not consistent with selection on behaviour in relation to the invasion process. We found that colonies with limited access to carbohydrates exhibited unchanged exploratory behaviour, but higher exploitation activity and lower aggression. Colonies given octopamine consistently increased foraging behaviour (both exploration and exploitation), as well as aggression when also sugar\u0010deprived. There was no difference in the degree of behavioural response to our experimental treatments along the introduction pathway. We did not find support for selection of behavioural traits associated with invasiveness along the Argentine ant's introduction pathway or clear evidence for an association between the introduction process and variation in behavioural plasticity. These results indicate that mechanisms promote behavioural variation in a similar fashion both in native and introduced ranges. Our results challenge the assumption that introduced populations always perform better in key behavioural traits hypothesised to be associated with invasion success.",

I critically analyzed programmed senescence in respect to the sociobiology of worker longevity & evaluated how large colony size achieved through selection for extended worker lifespan enhances colony fitness. My study found no support for worker programmed senescence.  Using robust behavioral assays, I found aging was not correlated with declines in sensory responsiveness or motor functions associated with foraging, nursing, & prey-capture tasks, or activity level & phototaxis.  Old minor workers (95 days) followed pheromone trails for greater distances than 20-day old minors & showed higher activity levels, suggesting improvement in behavioral performance.  Neural substrates likely underscoring task performance were maintained with age: synaptic complex density was constant & apoptosis was unchanged with age.  Sensory & motor control brain regions did not show age-related increases in neurodegeneration.  Worker spatial location predicted social role independent of age: foragers exhibited higher activity levels & more aggressive predatory behavior than nurses.  Serotonin & dopamine titers increased from 20 to 120 days, but showed no clear correlation with social role.  Pharmacological manipulations of brain serotonin had no effect on brood care, predatory response, activity, or phototaxis.  Finally, I assessed arborization of a serotonergic neuron hypothesized to underscore task performance to determine how aging across subcastes influences neuronal structure.  Major workers showed greater branching complexity than minors & an age-related increase in arbor complexity.

    "abstract": "Social insect workers modify task performance according to age-related schedules of behavioral development, and/or changing colony labor requirements based on flexible responses that may be independent of age. Using known-age minor workers of the ant Pheidole dentata throughout 68 % of their 140-day laboratory lifespan, we asked whether workers found inside or outside the nest differed in task performance and if behaviors were correlated with and/or causally linked to changes in brain serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA). Our results suggest that task performance patterns of individually assayed minors collected at these two spatially different worksites were independent of age. Outside-nest minors displayed significantly higher levels of predatory behavior and greater activity than inside-nest minors, but these groups did not differ in brood care or phototaxis. We examined the relationship of 5HT and DA to these behaviors in known-age minors by quantifying individual brain titers. Both monoamines did not increase significantly from 20 to 95 days of age. DA did not appear to directly regulate worksite location, although titers were significantly higher in outside-nest than inside-nest workers. Pharmacological depletion of 5HT did not affect nursing, predation, phototaxis, or activity. Our results suggest that worker task capabilities are independent of age beyond 20 days, and only predatory behavior can be consistently predicted by spatial location. This could reflect worker flexibility or variability in the behavior of individuals collected at each location, which could be influenced by complex interactions between age, worksite location, social interactions, neuromodulators, and other environmental and internal regulators of behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Physiological changes associated with worker age are considered to be important regulators of task performance in social insects. The extent to which worker age is correlated with behavior, and the degree to which developmental changes in neuromodulators control worker labor, however, are poorly understood. We found that ant workers are behaviorally flexible in respect to task performance at a given age, but differ in predatory response and activity level based on their worksite location (within or outside of the nest). Dopamine level was higher in outside-nest workers; serotonin did not appear to be causally linked to any behavior we examined. Our findings suggest that worker task performance can be independent of age, and workers maintain task efficacy throughout their lifespan while differing in some aspects of behavioral performance that may change with worksite location. Relationships between age, worksite, and neuromodulator titers appear to be complex.",

    "abstract": "Many studies suggest a role for biogenic amines in a variety of insect behaviors including intraspecific aggression. In ants, despite a rich behavioral repertoire and prominent aggressive interactions, little is known about the potential impact of biogenic amines.  This may partly be due to the general lack of information about aminergic systems in the ant brain.    The present study investigates serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems in the brain of the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator. In H. saltator, intraspecific aggression is important for the regulation of reproduction. This species, therefore, is amenable to comparative studies of aminergic neuronal effects on long-term changes in aggression. Using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that in the brains of sterile workers, the distributions of serotonergic and dopaminergic neuronal processes differed substantially. In addition, branching patterns of serotonergic neurons showed marked differences between males and females. Brains of workers after 3 days and 3 weeks of aggressive interactions revealed no marked differences in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons compared to those of reproductive and non-aggressive individuals. We conclude that different levels of intraspecific aggression do not involve profound anatomical changes in serotonergic and  dopaminergic neurons. Subtle changes may be masked by inter-individual variances.          *[Harpegnathos saltator colonies were initially excavated at Jog Falls, Karnataka State, Southern India in 1994, 1995, & 1999.

Carvacrol & thymol increased the locomotor activity of all ant species tested, but if blended reduced the movement propensity of Myrmica scabrinodis.  Dopamine & tyramine production was positively correlated with the worker locomotor activity.  In Myrmica ants, both brain biogenic ammines were negatively correlated with the aggressive behavior.

As adult minor workers of the ant Pheidole dentata age, they attend to brood more frequently and nurse more efficiently, perform a broader array of tasks, and undergo myological and neural development. Because these factors covary, the causal relationships among age, task experience, and neural and physiological maturation are not understood. We compared brood-care performance and efficiency by 10-day-old P. dentata minors that had acquired nursing experience to that of equal-age minors experimentally deprived of brood contact. We found the frequency and efficiency of nursing did not significantly differ between experimental and control worker groups, suggesting experience is not required for age-related improvement in nursing efficiency. Workers with and without prior nursing experience did not significantly differ macroscopically in brain anatomy or in brain serotonin content, although workers from the two treatments had slightly, but significantly, different levels of brain dopamine. These results suggest experience with brood is not required for P. dentata minor workers to develop nursing proficiency or undergo a substantial degree of the age-related neural development identifiable by our assessments, which could underscore the ontogeny of brood-care efficiency.",

    "abstract": "As social insect workers mature, outside-nest tasks associated with foraging and defense are typically performed at higher frequencies. Foraging in ants is often a pheromonally mediated collective action performed by mature workers; age-dependent differences in olfactory response thresholds may therefore proximately regulate task repertoire development. In the ant Pheidole dentata, foraging activity increases with chronological age in minor workers, and is chemically controlled. The onset of foraging in minor workers is accompanied by marked neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes, including synaptic remodeling in olfactory regions of the brain, proliferation of serotonergic neurons, and increased brain titers of monoamines, notably serotonin. We examined the linkage of serotonin and olfactory responsiveness by assaying trail-following performance in mature P. dentata minor workers with normal serotonin levels, or serotonin levels experimentally lowered by oral administration of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor Â±-methyltryptophan (AMTP). By assessing responsiveness to standardized pheromone trails, we demonstrate that trail-following behaviors are significantly reduced in serotonin-depleted workers. AMTP-treated individuals were less likely to initiate trail following, and oriented along pheromone trails for significantly shorter distances than untreated, similar-age workers. These results demonstrate for the first time that serotonin modulates olfactory processes and/or motor functions associated with cooperative foraging in ants.",

    "abstract": "Temporal polyethism, or age-correlated task performance, is a near universal feature of labor organization in social insects. Typically, young workers engage in within-nest work (nursing immatures), while older workers perform outside-nest work (foraging). In the ant Pheidole dentata, the number of tasks workers perform, and their task competence, increases as they age. This behavioral maturation is accompanied by marked neurological changes, including synaptic pruning, proliferation of serotonergic neurons, and increased dopamine and serotonin titres in the brain. Here we present novel evidence that worker brood-rearing efficiency also increases with age and that older workers are efficient nurses. This result contrasts with the traditional view that young workers form a discrete age caste that specializes on nursing. We next describe an additional neural correlate of temporal polyethism in P. dentata: expansion of the mushroom bodies, paired neuropils involved in learning and sensory integration. Finally, we provide the first experimental demonstration causally linking increased serotonin titre to two distinct components of foraging behavior: outside nest activity and responsiveness to trail pheromone. Workers fed the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan had increased serotonin levels (verified by HPLC), were more likely to leave the nest, and followed trails longer than controls or workers whose serotonin levels were reduced by the serotonin synthesis blocker alpha-methyltryptophan. These results further our understanding of the social organization of labor by focusing on neural development and the aminergic control of polyethism in P. dentata.

    "abstract": "Insect behavior is regulated by physiological and neurological systems. Biogenic amines play a role in motivating the behavior as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neurohormones in the nervous systems. In ants, the change of brain amine levels is linked to various behavioral properties: reproduction, cooperation, and hostility. Aggressiveness is also manipulated by the neurological systems. The social structures in some ant species are established by aggressive interactions among queens. However, there are a few cases showing the putative role of biogenic amines for the queen aggression. Vollenhovia nipponica is a social parasite ant, which establishes functional monogyny that antagonistic interactions among multiple queens lead to dominance hierarchy. In this time, we examined changes in the levels of biogenic amines in heads of queens in V. nipponica, associated with the observation of aggressive behavior. In the colonies, dealate queens violently attacked toward each other by biting and pulling on body parts. Whereas, the aggressive behavior was never observed in alate queens. In the measurements in four biogenic amines, serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), octopamine (OA), and tyramine (TA), the levels of 5-HT and DA in dealates were significantly higher than those in alates. The levels of OA and TA were not significantly different between them. Moreover, the similar changes were confirmed in the groups of young (10-30 days old) and old queens (more than 6-month old). In V. nipponica queens, 5-HT and DA could regulate motivation of aggression, irrespective of age. However, the changes of biogenic amines are possibly affected by other behavioral factors.",

    "abstract": "Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in H. saltator as well as drive differences in worker task performance.

    "abstract": "The olfactory lobes of crustaceans and the antennal lobes of insects are the primary olfactory brain centers in Tetraconata. Recent publications considered the apparent lack of olfactory centers in several crustacean and insect taxa and structural differences in the organization of olfactory and antennal lobes as evidence for an independent origin of both brain areas. In depth comparison of species within and across tetraconate taxa, however, rather demonstrates that many characters of the organization of tetraconate olfactory centers are shared even among distantly related clades, but have been modified in various taxon-specific ways. From the available data and from comparison with the situation in chilopods, a closely related mandibulate outgroup, we conclude that an olfactory lobe organized into spheroidal glomeruli is a plesiomorphic character of the tetraconate brain. Shared features between decapod crustaceans and neopteran insects are cholinergic uniglomerular afferent neurons, a single large serotonin-immunoreactive neuron, multiglomerular GABAergic local interneurons, and projection neurons of similar morphology. Taxon-specific apomorphies include loss of olfactory sensilla and olfactory lobes in palaeopteran insects, certain branchiopod, maxillopod, and isopod crustaceans, profound changes in glomerular architecture in decapod crustaceans, and decomposition of glomerular boundaries in orthopteroid insects. In holometabolous insects, olfactory afferent projections from mouthpart sensilla are integrated into the antennal lobe and an increased tendency of contralateral connections is observed in lepidopterans and dipterans. Sexual dimorphism of antennal lobes, prominent in several neopteran insects, has most likely occurred convergently, and is not observed in malacostracan crustaceans.",

To understand the role of brain neurochemistry in age-related division of labor, we measured the levels of serotonin, dopamine and octopamine in individual brains of minor workers of different ages.  Serotonin and dopamine levels were significantly correlated with worker age, both increased as minor workers matured, and serotonin rose significantly in the oldest ants.   In addition, the serotonin:dopamine ratio was significantly higher in the oldest workers.   Octopamine levels did not change with age, although the ratios of octopamine:serotonin & octopamine:dopamine were significantly higher in the youngest workers.  These age-associated changes in biogenic amine levels suggest an involvement of neuromodulators in minor worker behavioral ontogeny & temporal polyethism in P. dentata.]",

    "abstract": "Colonies of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, regulate foraging activity based on food availability and local conditions. Colony variation in foraging behavior is thought to be linked to biogenic amine signaling and metabolism. Measurements of differences in neurotransmitters have not been made among ant colonies in a natural environment. Here, for the first time, we quantified tissue content of 4 biogenic amines (dopamine, serotonin, octopamine, and tyramine) in single forager brains from 9 red harvester ant colonies collected in the field. Capillary electrophoresis coupled with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (CE-FSCV) was used to separate and detect the amines in individual ant brains. Low levels of biogenic amines were detected using field-amplified sample stacking by preparing a single brain tissue sample in acetonitrile and perchloric acid. The method provides low detection limits: 1 nM for dopamine, 2 nM for serotonin, 5 nM for octopamine, and 4 nM for tyramine. Overall, the content of dopamine (47\tÂ±\t9 pg/brain) was highest, followed by octopamine (36\tÂ±\t10 pg/brain), serotonin (20\tÂ±\t4 pg/brain), and tyramine (14\tÂ±\t3 pg/brain). Relative standard deviations were high, but there was less variation within a colony than among colonies, so the neurotransmitter content of each colony might change with environmental conditions. This study demonstrates that CE-FSCV is a useful method for investigating natural variation in neurotransmitter content in single ant brains and could be useful for future studies correlating tissue content with colony behavior such as foraging.",

We investigated whether differences in whole-brain levels of the biogenic amines dopamine (DA), serotonin (5HT), and octopamine (OA) are associated with task specialization and genotype in similarly sized and aged workers of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior, a polyandrous species in which genotype correlates with worker task specialization. We compared amine levels of foragers and waste management workers to test for an association with worker task, and young in-nest workers across patrilines to test for a genetic influence on brain amine levels. Foragers had higher levels of DA and OA and a higher OA:5HT ratio than waste management workers. Patrilines did not significantly differ in amine levels or their ratios, although patriline affected worker body size, which correlated with amine levels despite the small size range sampled. Levels of all three amines were correlated within individuals in both studies. Among patrilines, mean levels of DA and OA, and OA and 5HT were also correlated. Our results suggest that differences in biogenic amines could regulate worker task specialization, but may be not be significantly affected by genotype.",

    "abstract": "Various microscopic techniques allow investigating structures from submicron to millimeter range, however, this is only possible if the structures of interest are not covered by pigmented cuticle. Here, we present a protocol that combines clearing of pigmented cuticle while preserving both, hard and soft tissues. The resulting transparent cuticle allows confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM), which yields high-resolution images of e.g. the brain, glands, muscles and fine cuticular structures. Using a fluorescent dye, even single labeled neurons can be visualized and resolved up to an imaging depth of 150 Âºm through the cleared cuticle. Hydrogen-peroxide, which was used to clear the cuticle, does not preclude immunocytochemical techniques, shown by successful labeling of serotonin-immunoreactive neurons (5HT-ir) in the ants\u0019 brain. The 'transparent insect protocol' presented here is especially suited for small arthropods where dissection of organs is very demanding and difficult to achieve. Furthermore, the insect organs are preserved in situ thus allowing a more precise three-dimensional reconstruction of the structures of interest compared to, e.g., dissected or sectioned tissue.          *[We used adult leaf-cutting ants (Atta vollenweideri), collected in 2002 at the Reserva El Bagual, Formosa, Argentina (by M.

Significant effects of biogenic amine administration were observed almost exclusively in the case of confrontations with allospecific opponents.  Serotonin treatment exerted stimulatory effects on behavior patterns involving physical aggression (biting accompanied by gaster flexing, dragging, formic acid spraying), but these effects were relatively weak &/or documented by indirect evidence.  Dopamine administration exerted a stimulatory effect on open-mandible threats directed by F. polyctena to F. fusca & to cricket nymphs, & on biting behavior directed to cricket nymphs.  Surprisingly, octopamine treatment did not exert significant effects on aggressive behavior of the tested ants.  Tyramine administration exerted a suppressing effect on threatening behavior directed to F. fusca, but led to shortening of the latencies to the first open-mandible threat during the tests with cricket nymphs.  Biogenic amine administration also influenced non-aggressive behavior of the tested ants.  Our findings confirmed the role of serotonin & dopamine in the mediation of ant aggressive behavior & documented for the first time significant effects of tyramine treatment on ant aggressive behavior.  We also demonstrated that not only specific patterns of ant aggressive behavior, but also behavioral effects of biogenic amine treatments are as a rule strongly context-dependent.]",

    "abstract": "Social insect workers usually participate first in intranidal tasks (i.e. act as nurses within the nest) and then switch to extranidal tasks and become foragers. However, foragers sometimes switch back again to brood care and become reverted nurses. Behavioural and physiological correlates of the transition nurse-forager (behavioural maturation) and forager-reverted nurse (behavioural reversion) are relatively well known in the honeybee, although they are less explored in ants. To understand better the role of biogenic amines in ant behavioural maturation and behavioural reversion, the levels of octopamine (OA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) are examined in the brains of nurses, foragers and reverted nurses of the red wood ant Formica polyctena FË†rst. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Brain OA levels and the ratios OA : DA and OA : 5-HT are higher in nurses than in foragers and reverted nurses. Reverted nurses and foragers do not differ significantly with respect to brain biogenic amine levels and amine ratios. Biogenic amine levels in brains of workers of F. polyctena are thus maturation-related rather than task-related. This is one of the first studies of neurochemical correlates of ant behavioural maturation and the first attempt to identify neurobiological correlates of ant behavioural reversion. The data obtained provide further evidence that neurobiological processes underlying honeybee and ant behavioural maturation and behavioural reversion reveal important differences.",

Hydrophobic analysis suggests that 7 trans-membrane domains are the major sequence characteristic of the Pv5-HT7 receptor.  In addition, the Pv5-HT7 receptor has 3 potential N-glycosylation sites, a palmitoylation site, 3 protein kinase A phosphorylation sites, & 4 protein kinase C phosphorylation sites.  Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the deduced Pv5-HT7 receptor sequence shared a high homology with 5-HT7 receptor sequences of other species, such as a 78% similarity with the Am5-HT7 receptor (Apis mellifera).  Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that the expression level of the Pv5-HT7 receptor was low in the eggs & 1th-4th larval stages, but it was increased in the pupal stage & reached its peak in the adult workers.  Western blot results showed that the highest protein expression was in the male body, head, & thorax.

We propose that caste- and sex-specific adaptations in the olfactory pathway promote differences in olfactory behavior. This study compares olfactory centers in the brain of large (major) workers, small (minor) workers, virgin queens, and males of the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus. The number of glomeruli in the antennal lobe was similar in the female castes, although the glomerular volumes differed. Males had approximately 45% fewer glomeruli compared to females (approximately 258 and approximately 434) and one antennal sensory tract was absent. A dual output pathway to the mushroom bodies was present in males. In contrast to females, however, the number of glomeruli connected to the medial antennocerebral tract was substantially smaller than those associated with the lateral tract. All glomeruli in the male antennal lobe contained serotonergic processes, whereas in the female castes glomeruli in the large tract six cluster lacked serotonergic innervations. We conclude that differences in general glomerular organization are subtle among the female castes, but sex-specific differences in the number, connectivity and neuromodulatory innervation of glomeruli are substantial and likely to underlie differences in olfactory processing and learning.",
