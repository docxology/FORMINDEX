# FORMINDEX TO-DO LIST

## Overview
Maintaining and updating FORMIS requires the cooperative efforts of computational myrmecologists (myrmecological computationalists) worldwide. This document outlines the tasks and areas for improvement to keep FORMIS a valuable resource for the community.

## View
From the ground: vigilant antennae, tireless legs, and many effective neural systems are needed to keep FORMIS (as nest and niche) useful. 

## Database Updates
- How/Should we update with adding information and citations? 

### Requirements for specialty bibliographies:
- Can range from a few dozen citations to several thousand
- Must be thorough in their coverage

## Additional Contribution Methods
- Add new citations by journal

## Future Development Ideas
1. Implement a system for users to submit updates and new entries directly.
2. Develop a web interface for easier browsing and searching of the database.
3. Create an API for programmatic access to FORMIS data.
4. Establish a regular update schedule and announcement system for new versions.
5. Collaborate with other entomological databases for cross-referencing and data sharing.
6. Refine and expand the genus-level bibliography generation script:
   - Improve genus detection accuracy
   - Add options for different output formats (e.g., BibTeX, CSV)
   - Implement a user interface for selecting specific genera

## Recent Updates
- Modified the script (`Scripts/generate_genus_bibliographies.py`) to generate targeted bibliographies for specific genera, subjects, and geographic areas.
- The script now focuses on the following targets:
  - Genera: Formica, Camponotus, Myrmica, Pheidole, Monomorium, Messor, Cataglyphis
  - Subjects: Foraging, Bioenergetics, Myrmecophiles, Ant-plant symbioses
  - Geographic areas: Hawaii, India, Mexico, Brazil
