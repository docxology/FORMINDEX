## Timeline of Major Milestones in Myrmecology (1950 to Present)

### 1950s

#### Early Taxonomic and Behavioral Studies
- **1950s**: E.O. Wilson begins his career in myrmecology, focusing on ant taxonomy and microevolution. He collects ant species in various expeditions, including Cuba, Mexico, and the South Pacific.

#### Discovery of Ancient Ant Fossils
- **1960s (but discoveries date back to the 1950s)**: Fossil remains of ants from the Cretaceous period are identified. Wilson and his colleagues discover fossils trapped in amber, dating back around 92 million years, which show features of both wasps and modern ants.

### 1960s

#### Pheromone Classification and Island Biogeography
- **1960s**: Wilson, in collaboration with mathematician William H. Bossert, develops a classification of pheromones based on insect communication patterns. He also collaborates with Robert MacArthur to develop the theory of species equilibrium, which is later tested on mangrove islets in the Florida Keys.

### 1970s

#### Sociobiology and Insect Societies
- **1971**: Wilson publishes *The Insect Societies*, arguing that insect behavior and other animal behaviors are influenced by similar evolutionary pressures.
- **1975**: Wilson publishes *Sociobiology: The New Synthesis*, applying his theories of insect behavior to vertebrates and humans. This work sparks significant debate and criticism but also establishes sociobiology as a major field of study.

#### Curator of Entomology
- **1973**: Wilson is appointed the curator of entomology at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.

### 1980s

#### Gene-Culture Coevolution
- **1981**: Wilson publishes *Genes, Mind and Culture*, co-authored with Charles Lumsden, introducing the theory of gene-culture coevolution.

### 1990s

#### Comprehensive Ant Studies
- **1990**: Wilson and Bert Hölldobler publish *The Ants*, a comprehensive and encyclopedic work on ant biology, winning Wilson his second Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.

#### Ecological and Biodiversity Studies
- **1992**: Wilson publishes *The Diversity of Life*, highlighting the importance of biodiversity and ecological conservation.

### 2000s to Present

#### Advanced Genetic and Behavioral Studies
- **2000s**: Advances in genetic research reveal more about the genetic basis of ant polymorphisms and social behavior. For example, studies on *Solenopsis invicta* show that differences in a single gene can determine whether a colony has single or multiple queens.
- **2000s**: Research on ant colonies, such as *Myrmecocystus mexicanus*, provides insights into colony growth, replete formation, and nutritional strategies. Care tips and experimental setups are documented to help in the maintenance and study of ant colonies.

#### Ecological Dominance and Adaptive Radiation
- **Ongoing**: Continued research emphasizes the ecological dominance of ants, particularly after their adaptive radiation at the beginning of the Paleogene period. Studies show that by the Oligocene and Miocene, ants represented 20–40% of all insects in major fossil deposits.

## Explanatory Text

### Paradigm Shifts

- **From Taxonomy to Sociobiology**: The transition from purely taxonomic studies to a more holistic understanding of ant societies, as seen in Wilson's *The Insect Societies* and *Sociobiology: The New Synthesis*, marked a significant paradigm shift. This shift emphasized the evolutionary pressures shaping social behavior in insects and other animals.

- **Genetic Basis of Social Behavior**: The discovery of genetic factors influencing ant social behavior, such as the role of single genes in determining queen number in *Solenopsis invicta*, has deepened our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of ant societies.

- **Ecological Studies**: The recognition of ants' ecological dominance, particularly after the Angiosperm Terrestrial Revolution, has highlighted their crucial role in ecosystems. This understanding has been reinforced by fossil records and modern ecological studies.

### Impact on Understanding of Ant Biology

- **Comprehensive Understanding**: Works like *The Ants* by Wilson and Hölldobler have provided a comprehensive framework for understanding ant biology, covering aspects from taxonomy and evolution to social behavior and ecology.

- **Conservation and Ecological Awareness**: Wilson's advocacy for biodiversity and ecological conservation, as seen in *The Diversity of Life*, has raised awareness about the importance of preserving ant populations and their habitats.

- **Experimental and Practical Knowledge**: Detailed studies on maintaining ant colonies, such as the care tips for *Myrmecocystus mexicanus*, have facilitated experimental research and hobbyist engagement with ant biology.
