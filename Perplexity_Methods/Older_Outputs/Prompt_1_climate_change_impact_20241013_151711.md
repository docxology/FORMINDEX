## Impact of Climate Change on Ant Species Diversity: A Meta-Analysis

### Introduction

Climate change is exerting significant pressures on ecosystems worldwide, and ant species, being key ecological actors, are no exception. This meta-analysis synthesizes recent studies (published in the last 5 years) to understand the impact of climate change on ant species diversity, distribution, and community composition.

### Effects of Climate Change on Ant Communities

#### Temperature and Elevation Gradients

Studies have shown that temperature changes significantly affect ant communities. In the European Alps, ant diversity decreases with increasing elevation and lower temperatures. Here, maximum temperature was found to be weakly related to ant diversity compared to mean and minimum temperatures.

In Australian rainforests, arboreal ant communities exhibited lower species turnover compared to ground-nesting ants. This difference is attributed to the ability of arboreal ants to move up or down the canopy to adjust to temperature changes, whereas ground-nesting ants are more restricted in their climatic niche.

#### Geographic and Phylogenetic Hotspots

Climate change impacts ant species differently across various geographic and phylogenetic contexts. In general, warmer locations and time periods host greater ant abundance and species richness. However, species living in the tropics and in thermally variable microhabitats, such as the canopy and leaf litter, are likely to be negatively impacted by rising temperatures.

#### Community Composition and Species Richness

A 60-year study in Gregory Canyon, Colorado, revealed significant changes in ant community composition. Contemporary ant communities were more similar in composition than historical communities, with some species moving into the area and others disappearing. Ants that could forage across a broader range of temperatures showed increased occurrence.

### Adaptation and Vulnerability

#### Eusociality and Behavioral Adaptations

The eusocial nature of ants may confer greater adaptation and tolerance to climate change. Ants' social structure allows for behavioral and phenotypic plasticity, enabling them to escape some effects of climate change that solitary species cannot.

#### Habitat-Specific Vulnerabilities

Ground-nesting ant communities are more vulnerable to climate change due to their restricted climatic niches. In contrast, arboreal ant species, which can adjust their position in the canopy, are less vulnerable. This highlights the importance of conserving forest floor habitats to protect ground-nesting ants.

### Conservation Implications

#### Fine-Scale Environmental Changes

Climate change has fine-scale effects on species within different sub-regions or even within individual trees of the same biome. This complexity needs to be accounted for in conservation plans. Preserving forest floor habitats and reducing deforestation and infrastructure development in rainforests are crucial for maintaining ecosystem integrity.

#### Monitoring and Historical Data

Using historical data to monitor changes in ant communities over time is essential. Studies like the one in Gregory Canyon demonstrate the value of resampling historical sites to understand long-term changes in insect biodiversity.

### Key Findings and Implications

- **Species Turnover and Diversity**: Arboreal ant communities show lower species turnover and greater coexistence among species compared to ground-nesting ants.
- **Elevation and Temperature**: Ant diversity decreases with increasing elevation and lower temperatures, with maximum temperature having a weaker impact compared to mean and minimum temperatures.
- **Geographic and Phylogenetic Contexts**: Warmer locations and time periods generally host greater ant abundance and species richness, but tropical and thermally variable microhabitats are more vulnerable.
- **Community Changes**: Long-term studies reveal shifts in ant community composition, with some species adapting better to changing temperatures than others.
- **Conservation**: Preserving diverse habitats, including forest floors and canopies, is crucial for maintaining ant species diversity and ecosystem health.
