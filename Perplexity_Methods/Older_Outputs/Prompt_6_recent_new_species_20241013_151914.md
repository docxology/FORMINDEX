### Explanatory Text

#### Paraparatrechina neela
This new species, discovered in the remote Siang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh, India, is notable for its striking metallic blue coloration, a rarity among ants. The name *Paraparatrechina neela* reflects this unique feature, with "neela" meaning blue in various Indian languages. This discovery is significant as it marks the first new ant species found in the Indian subcontinent in over a century and highlights the rich biodiversity of the Eastern Himalayas. The blue coloration of *P. neela* raises intriguing questions about its ecological role, such as whether it aids in communication, camouflage, or other interactions.

#### Leptanilla voldemort
Found in the arid Pilbara region of north-western Australia, *Leptanilla voldemort* is a pale, slender ant with long, sharp mandibles. This species is named after the dark wizard Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter series, reflecting its ghostly appearance and elusive nature. *L. voldemort* is significant because it is only the second Leptanilla species discovered in Australia and contributes to our understanding of the unique biodiversity of the Pilbara region. The species' specialized morphology and behavior, including its sharp jaws and powerful stings, suggest it is a formidable predator in the underground environment.
