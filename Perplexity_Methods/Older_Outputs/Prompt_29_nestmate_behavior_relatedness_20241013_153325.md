## Relatedness Estimates for Behavioral Traits Among Ant Nestmates

### Introduction

The study of relatedness and its impact on behavioral traits among ant nestmates is a crucial area of research in myrmecology, as it helps understand the intricate social structures and cooperative behaviors within ant colonies. Here, we will examine the latest research on how genetic relatedness influences individual-level behaviors such as task preference, aggression, and social interactions.

## Genetic Relatedness and Behavioral Similarity

### Influence of Relatedness on Behavioral Traits

Genetic relatedness among ant nestmates can significantly influence their behavioral traits. Studies have shown that the relatedness among queens and workers can affect reproductive competition, task allocation, and social interactions within the colony.

- In the ant species *Formica fusca*, queens adjust their reproductive efforts based on the relatedness and fecundity of other queens in the colony. Queens respond to the presence of highly fecund and distantly related competitors by increasing their egg-laying efforts, while they decrease their reproductive output in the presence of highly related competitors.
- The variation in relatedness among nestmates can also impact the distribution of behavioral traits. For instance, higher intracolonial variance in aggression has been linked to increased colony productivity, suggesting that genetic diversity and relatedness patterns can influence the behavioral plasticity of ant colonies.

## Methods for Quantifying Relatedness and Behavioral Traits

### Genetic Techniques

Advanced genetic techniques are increasingly used to estimate relatedness among ant nestmates.

- Maximum likelihood estimation using software like ML-Relate is employed to estimate pairwise relatedness among queens and workers. This method was used in a study on *Formica fusca* to investigate how relatedness influences reproductive competition among queens.
- Genetic markers such as microsatellites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are used to determine the genetic structure and relatedness within ant colonies. These markers help in understanding the genetic basis of behavioral traits and how they are distributed among nestmates.

### Behavioral Assays

Novel behavioral assays are designed to measure specific behavioral traits and their variation among ant nestmates.

- Laboratory experiments involving manipulated social environments, such as the presence of odors from other queens, are used to study how queens adjust their reproductive behaviors based on relatedness and fecundity.
- Field and laboratory observations of task allocation and social interactions among workers help in understanding how relatedness influences the division of labor and social cohesion within the colony. For example, studies have shown that workers adjust their nestmate recognition based on learning novel chemical labels (cuticular hydrocarbons), which can vary among nestmates.

## Advanced Models and Frameworks

### Active Inference and Bayesian Models

Recent studies have employed advanced models to understand the collective behavior of ant colonies and how individual-level behaviors are influenced by relatedness.

- The active inference framework, which integrates Bayesian inference and stigmergic regulation, has been used to model ant colony foraging behavior. This framework suggests that ant colonies engage in collective decision-making through a stochastic sampling of environmental gradients, which can be influenced by the genetic and behavioral diversity of nestmates.

## Conclusion

The relationship between genetic relatedness and behavioral traits among ant nestmates is complex and multifaceted. Advanced genetic techniques and novel behavioral assays have provided insights into how relatedness influences task preference, aggression, and social interactions.

- Genetic relatedness can modulate reproductive competition, task allocation, and social cohesion within ant colonies.
- Advanced models such as active inference and Bayesian frameworks help in understanding the collective behavior of ant colonies and the role of individual-level behaviors in these processes.
