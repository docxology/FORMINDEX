## Recent Ant-Related Research at UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology (2020-2024)

### Overview of Research Focus

The UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology has been actively involved in various research projects related to ant ecology, behavior, and evolution, although the primary focus of the department's recent publications and news appears to be more broadly on entomology and microbial ecology. Here, we will highlight the relevant ant-related research and notable achievements in myrmecology.

## Significant Researchers and Their Contributions

### Philip S. Ward

- **Professor of Entomology**: Philip S. Ward is a prominent myrmecologist at UC Davis, known for his extensive work on ant systematics and phylogeny.
- **Research Projects**: Ward's research encompasses species-level taxonomy and molecular phylogenetics of various ant groups, including the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae and the tribe Camponotini. He has also collaborated with Jack Longino on the ants of Central America.
- **Methodological Advances**: Ward has transitioned from morphological taxonomy to incorporating molecular methods, including Sanger-sequencing and more recently, phylogenomic approaches. This integration of methods has significantly improved the resolution of ant phylogenies.

## Ongoing Studies and Collaborations

### Systematics and Phylogeny

- **Phylogenomic Approaches**: Ward's lab has been adopting phylogenomic methods, analyzing thousands of genes to provide detailed and resolved phylogenies. This approach is expected to continue advancing our understanding of ant evolutionary relationships.

### Ecological and Behavioral Studies

- While the Vannette lab primarily focuses on microbial ecology and plant-insect interactions, there is less direct focus on ant ecology and behavior within the recent publications and news. However, the department's broad scope in entomology suggests potential for future collaborations and studies that could include ants.

## Notable Achievements, Grants, and Recognition

### Philip S. Ward

- **Grant Funding**: Ward has received grants to study the phylogeny of the tribe Camponotini, among other projects. This funding supports the ongoing research in ant systematics and phylogeny.

### Departmental Recognition

- **General Department Achievements**: The Department of Entomology and Nematology at UC Davis has a strong reputation for research excellence, with various faculty members receiving awards and recognition. For example, Rachel Vannette, though not primarily a myrmecologist, has received several awards including the UC Davis Chancellorâ€™s Fellow and NSF CAREER Award, which highlights the department's overall research excellence.

## Implications for Local and Global Ant Biology and Ecology

### Systematic and Phylogenetic Studies

- **Global Implications**: Ward's work on ant systematics and phylogeny has global implications, as it helps in understanding the evolutionary history and diversity of ants worldwide. This knowledge is crucial for conservation efforts and understanding ecological roles of ants in different ecosystems.

### Potential for Future Research

- **Integration with Microbial Ecology**: While the current focus is on other areas of entomology, there is potential for future studies to integrate ant ecology with microbial ecology, given the department's expertise in this area. This could reveal new insights into how ants interact with their microbial environments and the ecological consequences of these interactions.

## Conclusion

The UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology, particularly through the work of Philip S. Ward, continues to contribute significantly to the field of myrmecology. The integration of morphological and molecular methods in ant systematics and phylogeny is a key area of advancement. While the department's recent publications and news may not be heavily focused on ant ecology and behavior, the broader research environment suggests a rich potential for future studies in these areas.
