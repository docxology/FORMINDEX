## Situation

### Key Problems: What are the key problems the group has been formed to address?
- **Integration of Active Inference Across Disciplines**: The group aims to address the challenge of integrating active inference and the free energy principle across multiple disciplines, including neuroscience, psychology, machine learning, and theoretical biology.
- **Practical Applications and Real-World Implementation**: There is a need to translate theoretical models into practical applications and to explore real-world implementations of active inference.
- **Education and Dissemination**: The group seeks to improve education and dissemination of active inference concepts to a broader audience, including researchers, students, and industry professionals.

### User Segments: Who is affected by these problems?
- Researchers in neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning
- Students interested in active inference and the free energy principle
- Industry professionals looking to apply active inference in various settings (e.g., robotics, wellness)
- General public interested in cognitive science and theoretical biology

## Mission

### Value Proposition: Given the situation, in clear terms, with no jargon, what is your objective? What value do you aim to provide?
- To facilitate a comprehensive understanding and application of active inference and the free energy principle across various fields.
- To provide a platform for researchers, students, and industry professionals to share knowledge, collaborate, and innovate.
- To enhance education and public engagement in active inference through workshops, conferences, and online resources.

## Potential Avenues of Approach

### Approach: Given the situation and mission, what are the potential avenues of approach?
- **Workshops and Conferences**:
  - Organize and participate in workshops like the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference (IWAI 2024) to bring together researchers and discuss current trends, novel results, and real-world applications.
  - Host conferences that include presentations on various aspects of active inference, such as modeling sustainability, contextuality, and cognitive engagement.

- **Education and Training**:
  - Develop educational programs, such as the Textbook Group and research fellowship programs, to support learning and research in active inference.

- **Industry and Public Engagement**:
  - Collaborate with organizations through partnership programs to apply active inference in different settings, such as robotics and wellness.
  - Engage the public through online resources, webinars, and social media platforms.

- **Research and Innovation**:
  - Encourage interdisciplinary research by integrating active inference with other fields like machine learning, deep learning, and cognitive science.
  - Support innovative projects and provide mechanisms for catalyzing new discoveries and applications.

## Recent Events and Key Themes

### Academic Events
- **5th International Workshop on Active Inference (IWAI 2024)**:
  - Held at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, UK, this workshop brought together researchers to discuss current trends, novel results, and real-world applications of active inference. Notable presentations included "Toward a Game-Theoretic Foundation of Multi-Agent Active Inference" and "Free Energy in a Circumplex Model of Emotions".

- **Active Inference Bookstream and Livestreams**:
  - The Active Inference Institute has been hosting bookstreams and livestreams, including discussions on the textbook "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and Karl J. Friston.

### Industry and Public Engagement Activities
- **Research Fellowship and Partnership Programs**:
  - The Active Inference Institute has initiated research fellowship programs and partnership programs to support research and applications of active inference. These programs aim to provide a structured venue for organizations to collaborate and apply active inference in various settings.

- **Quarterly Roundtable Discussions**:
  - The institute conducts quarterly roundtable discussions to share information about ongoing projects, engagement types, and future developments. These discussions are open to new participants and aim to foster broader engagement and collaboration.

### Notable Presentations and Emerging Collaborations
- **Multi-Agent Active Inference**:
  - Presentations like "Toward a Game-Theoretic Foundation of Multi-Agent Active Inference" highlight emerging collaborations in multi-agent systems and game theory.

- **Integration with Machine Learning**:
  - There is a growing interest in integrating active inference with machine learning, as seen in discussions on hybrid setups combining active inference with deep learning.

- **Cognitive Science and Neuroscience**:
  - Collaborations in cognitive science and neuroscience are evident in papers like "Feeling our place in the world: an active inference account of self-esteem," which formalizes self-esteem using the active inference framework.

## Potential Opportunities for Organizing Active Inference-Related Events

### Workshops and Conferences
- **Themed Workshops**: Organize workshops focused on specific themes such as active inference in robotics, active inference in cognitive science, or the application of the free energy principle in machine learning.

### Online Engagement
- **Webinars and Online Courses**: Develop webinars and online courses to educate a broader audience about active inference and its applications.

### Industry Collaborations
- **Hackathons and Innovation Challenges**: Host hackathons or innovation challenges where participants can apply active inference to real-world problems, fostering innovation and collaboration between academia and industry.

### Public Outreach
- **Public Lectures and Science Festivals**: Organize public lectures and participate in science festivals to engage the general public in the concepts and applications of active inference.
