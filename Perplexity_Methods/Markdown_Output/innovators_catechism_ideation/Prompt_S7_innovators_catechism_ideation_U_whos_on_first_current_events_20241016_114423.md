### "Who's on First? - The Vaccine Edition"

**Setting:** A public health office. Bud Abbott is behind the desk, and Lou Costello is standing opposite him.

**Bud Abbott:** Well, Lou, you want to know about the vaccination policy?

**Lou Costello:** Yes, I do. Who's vaccinated?

**Bud Abbott:** Who is vaccinated.

**Lou Costello:** What do you mean "Who"?

**Bud Abbott:** The person's name is Who.

**Lou Costello:** But I'm asking who is vaccinated.

**Bud Abbott:** Who is vaccinated.

**Lou Costello:** I don't know. Is What vaccinated?

**Bud Abbott:** What is on second.

**Lou Costello:** On second? What does that have to do with vaccination?

**Bud Abbott:** No, What is the name of the person on second base in our analogy.

**Lou Costello:** So, What is vaccinated?

**Bud Abbott:** No, What is on second. I Don't Know is on third.

**Lou Costello:** I Don't Know? Is he vaccinated?

**Bud Abbott:** I Don't Know is on third base. He's not the one we're talking about.

**Lou Costello:** But who is vaccinated? You said Who.

**Bud Abbott:** Yes, Who is vaccinated.

**Lou Costello:** And what about masks? Do vaccinated people wear masks?

**Bud Abbott:** Why is wearing a mask.

**Lou Costello:** Why? What do you mean "Why"?

**Bud Abbott:** The person's name is Why. He's the left fielder.

**Lou Costello:** The left fielder? I'm asking about masks!

**Bud Abbott:** Oh, masks. Well, masks are worn by everyone, but it doesn't matter if you're vaccinated or not.

**Lou Costello:** So, masks don't work?

**Bud Abbott:** Masks work, but they're like a curveball – they can still get you even if you're prepared.

**Lou Costello:** A curveball? You mean like in baseball?

**Bud Abbott:** Exactly. And just like in baseball, sometimes you swing and miss.

**Lou Costello:** So, if I'm not vaccinated, I can't come in?

**Bud Abbott:** That's right. You're like a runner on third base – you can't advance without the right signal.

**Lou Costello:** But if everyone in here is vaccinated, why can't I come in?

**Bud Abbott:** Because you're like a wild pitch – unpredictable and potentially risky.

**Lou Costello:** Unpredictable? But I'm not sick!

**Bud Abbott:** That's like saying a strike is just a ball – it's all about the call.

**Lou Costello:** (frustrated) This is like trying to catch a knuckleball!

**Bud Abbott:** (smiling) Exactly, Lou. It's all about the spin.
