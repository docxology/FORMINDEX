## Relatedness Estimates for Behavioral Traits in Ant Colonies

The study of behavioral traits in ant colonies has revealed complex interactions between genetic relatedness, environmental factors, and social organization. Here, we review key studies that have quantified genetic correlations or heritability of behaviors at the colony level, focusing on foraging strategies, nest defense, and division of labor.

### Genetic Correlations and Heritability

#### Heritability of Collective Behavior
Studies have shown that colony-level behavioral variation in ants is influenced by genetic factors. For instance, the heritability of social insect collective behavior has been estimated in several studies. Linksvayer (2006) and Hunt et al. (2007) demonstrated that a significant portion of the variation in collective behaviors such as foraging, aggression, and exploration can be attributed to genetic differences within colonies.

In a study using the pharaoh ant *Monomorium pharaonis*, the importance of intra-group genetic composition in producing emergent group-level behavior was highlighted. The study found that the genotype of group members interacted significantly for behaviors like exploration, suggesting the importance of G Ã— G epistasis.

#### Genetic Diversity and Behavioral Variation
The amount of genetic diversity within a social insect colony, influenced by factors such as monogyny vs. polygyny and the level of polyandry, plays a crucial role in behavioral variation. Increased genetic diversity can lead to a greater likelihood that some individuals will respond to stimuli, thereby influencing collective behavior. For example, increased genetic diversity within a group can lead to higher levels of aggression and exploration because there is a greater chance that some group members will respond aggressively or venture out to explore.

### Methodologies Used to Measure Behavioral Traits

#### Behavioral Assays
Studies often employ a variety of behavioral assays to measure traits such as foraging effort, response to threats, and aggression levels. For example, Bengston and Dornhaus (2014) used field and laboratory assays to measure foraging distance, foraging effort to familiar and novel resources, activity level, and response to threat in *Temnothorax rugatulus* colonies.

#### Genetic Analysis
Genetic analysis involves estimating the heritability of behavioral traits and identifying candidate genes linked to variation in collective behavior. Studies have used quantitative genetic approaches to estimate the heritability of traits such as aggression, foraging, and exploration. For instance, candidate gene studies have linked allelic variation to variation in collective behavior in ants.

#### Statistical Models
Statistical models, such as the response-threshold model, are used to understand how workers within a social insect colony differ intrinsically in their behavioral responses. This model posits that workers differ in the stimulus level at which they begin to behaviorally respond, possibly due to genotypic differences.

### Implications for Understanding the Evolution of Social Behavior

#### Colony-Level Selection
The findings suggest that colony-level selection can act on behavioral traits, similar to individual-level selection in solitary species. This implies that differences between colonies in behaviors such as aggression, foraging, and exploration can evolve and have ecological consequences.

#### Division of Labor
The division of labor within ant colonies is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Workers can specialize in various tasks, and the distribution of these behavioral types within a colony can affect its overall productivity and success. For example, higher intracolonial variance in aggression can positively influence ant colony productivity.

#### Environmental Influence
Environmental variability can induce changes in group behavior, and different habitat types can exert different selective pressures on individual and colony behavioral variation. This is evident from studies showing that habitat-dependent factors, such as colony size and nest density, influence the mean and residual variation of behavioral traits.

### Conclusion

The study of relatedness estimates for behavioral traits in ant colonies highlights the complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and social factors. Understanding these interactions is crucial for elucidating the evolution of social behavior in ants.
