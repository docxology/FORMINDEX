### Characters:
- **Bud**: The straight man, similar to Abbott in the original routine.
- **Lou**: The confused character, similar to Costello.

### Setting:
A modern baseball stadium, with Bud and Lou discussing the current team lineup and various current events.

### Dialog:

```markdown
**Bud:** Alright, Lou, let's go over the lineup. We've got "Meta" on first base.

**Lou:** Meta? What's his real name?

**Bud:** No, Meta is his name. He's the new social media sensation.

**Lou:** But I thought we had "TikTok" on first?

**Bud:** No, TikTok is on second. Meta is on first.

**Lou:** So, TikTok is on second, and Meta is on first. Who's pitching?

**Bud:** "Elon" is pitching today.

**Lou:** Elon? Which Elon?

**Bud:** Elon Musk, of course. He's trying out his new SpaceX fastball.

**Lou:** But I heard "Tesla" was pitching.

**Bud:** No, Tesla is the car company. Elon is the pitcher.

**Lou:** Okay, so Elon is pitching, and Meta is on first. What about the catcher?

**Bud:** "AI" is catching today.

**Lou:** AI? Artificial Intelligence?

**Bud:** Yes, AI is the catcher. It's a new automated system.

**Lou:** But how does AI catch the ball?

**Bud:** It's a smart catcher. It uses machine learning.

**Lou:** And what about the shortstop? Is it still "Crypto"?

**Bud:** No, Crypto is on the bench today. We've got "NFT" playing shortstop.

**Lou:** NFT? What's his real name?

**Bud:** NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. It's a new player.

**Lou:** So, NFT is on shortstop, and AI is catching. Who's in left field?

**Bud:** "Climate" is in left field.

**Lou:** Climate? That's not a person!

**Bud:** It's a special player. Climate is always changing positions.

**Lou:** And what about the right fielder? Is it still "Vaccine"?

**Bud:** No, Vaccine is not playing today. We've got "Mask" in right field.

**Lou:** Mask? Why is Mask playing?

**Bud:** Because Mask is still effective, even though Vaccine is not playing.

**Lou:** But how can Mask play if Vaccine is not on the team?

**Bud:** It's a new strategy. Mask can still prevent the spread.

**Lou:** This is all confusing. Who's on first again?

**Bud:** Meta is on first.

**Lou:** And who's on second?

**Bud:** TikTok is on second.

**Lou:** And who's pitching?

**Bud:** Elon is pitching.

**Lou:** (frustrated) I don't know what's going on here!

**Bud:** (laughing) That's okay, Lou. It's just the modern lineup.

**Lou:** (exasperated) Third base!
