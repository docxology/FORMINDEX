## PhD Dissertation Proposal: Applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to Study Collective Behavior in Social Insects (Ants)

### Abstract
This PhD dissertation proposal aims to explore the application of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to understand the collective behavior of social insects, specifically ants. By integrating theoretical frameworks from neuroscience, complexity science, and artificial intelligence, this research will investigate how ants optimize their behavior to maintain homeostasis and achieve collective goals. The proposal outlines the theoretical background, research questions, methodologies, expected outcomes, and potential implications for various fields.

### Introduction
- **Background**: Collective behavior in social insects, such as ants, is a complex phenomenon that has fascinated scientists across multiple disciplines.
- **Research Gap**: Current theories often lack a unified framework to explain the intricate interactions and decision-making processes within ant colonies.
- **Objective**: To apply Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to provide a comprehensive understanding of ant collective behavior.

### Theoretical Background
#### Active Inference and Free Energy Principle
- **Definition**: Active Inference is a theoretical framework that posits that biological agents act to minimize variational free energy, which reflects the difference between the agent's internal model of the world and the sensory evidence it receives.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Variational Free Energy: Measures the difference between the agent's beliefs and the sensory observations.
  - Expected Free Energy: Guides policy selection by balancing extrinsic and epistemic values.
  - Markov Blankets: Statistical partitions that separate internal and external states, crucial for maintaining autonomy.

#### Collective Behavior in Social Insects
- **Overview**: Ants exhibit complex collective behaviors such as foraging, nest building, and social organization.
- **Current Theories**: Include self-organization, swarm intelligence, and communication-based models.

### Research Questions
1. **How do individual ants use Active Inference to optimize their behavior in response to environmental cues?**
2. **How do collective behaviors in ant colonies emerge from the interactions of individual ants minimizing their free energy?**
3. **Can the Free Energy Principle explain the adaptability and resilience of ant colonies in changing environments?**
4. **How do different types of ants (e.g., workers, soldiers, queens) differ in their free energy minimization strategies?**

### Proposed Methodologies
#### Empirical Methods
- **Observational Studies**: Use camera traps and tracking systems to monitor ant behavior in natural and controlled environments.
- **Experimental Manipulations**: Alter environmental conditions (e.g., food availability, nest structure) to observe changes in ant behavior.
- **Neuroscience Techniques**: Use optogenetics, calcium imaging, or other methods to study neural activity in ants during different behaviors.

#### Computational Methods
- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Develop simulations using Active Inference models to mimic ant behavior and test hypotheses.
- **Machine Learning**: Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of ant behavior and identify patterns consistent with Active Inference.
- **Message Passing Algorithms**: Implement Forney-style factor graph representations for automated free energy minimization.

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Quantitative Models**: Develop and validate computational models of ant behavior based on Active Inference.
2. **Empirical Evidence**: Provide experimental evidence supporting the role of Active Inference in ant collective behavior.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the predictive power of Active Inference models against alternative theories of collective behavior.
4. **Insights into Adaptability**: Understand how ant colonies adapt to environmental changes through the lens of free energy minimization.

### Potential Implications
#### Complexity Science
- **Unified Framework**: Offer a unified theoretical framework for understanding collective behavior across different species.
- **Scalability**: Explore how Active Inference scales from individual to collective levels.

#### Artificial Intelligence
- **Biologically Inspired AI**: Develop AI systems that mimic the decision-making processes of ants, enhancing autonomy and adaptability.
- **Swarm Robotics**: Apply Active Inference to swarm robotics to improve coordination and task execution.

#### Collective Intelligence
- **Human Collective Behavior**: Draw parallels between ant collective behavior and human social behavior, potentially informing strategies for human collective action.
- **Ecological Systems**: Understand the implications of Active Inference for other ecological systems and their resilience.

### Innovative Experimental Designs
1. **Hybrid Observational-Experimental Setup**:
   - Combine camera traps with manipulable environmental factors to study how ants adapt to changes.
2. **Neuro-Tracking Systems**:
   - Use optogenetics and calcium imaging to track neural activity in ants during different tasks.
3. **Mixed Reality Environments**:
   - Create mixed reality environments where ants interact with virtual and real-world stimuli to test hypotheses on free energy minimization.

### Testing Active Inference Models
1. **Comparison with Alternative Theories**:
   - Test Active Inference models against self-organization, swarm intelligence, and communication-based models.
2. **Predictive Validity**:
   - Evaluate the predictive power of Active Inference models using empirical data.
3. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Conduct sensitivity analyses to understand how changes in model parameters affect the behavior of the system.

## Conclusion
This PhD dissertation proposal aims to bridge the gap between neuroscience, complexity science, and artificial intelligence by applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to study collective behavior in ants. The expected outcomes will contribute significantly to our understanding of collective behavior and have broad implications for various fields.
