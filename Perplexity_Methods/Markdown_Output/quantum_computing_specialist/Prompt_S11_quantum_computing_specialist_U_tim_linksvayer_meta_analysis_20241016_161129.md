### Introduction

Professor Tim Linksvayer, currently an Associate Professor at Arizona State University, has made significant contributions to the understanding of social insect genetics, genomics, and the evolution of social behavior. His research spans over two decades, with a focus on the genetic and behavioral underpinnings of complex social systems.

### Theoretical Background and Early Work

Linksvayer's early work, as evident from his Ph.D. thesis and initial publications, focused on the evolutionary origin and maintenance of eusociality in the aculeate Hymenoptera. His 2005 paper with MJ Wade, "The evolutionary origin and elaboration of sociality in the aculeate Hymenoptera: maternal effects, sib-social effects, and heterochrony," set the stage for his future research by exploring the roles of maternal effects, sib-social effects, and heterochrony in the evolution of sociality.

### Evolution of Research Focus

#### Genetic and Behavioral Underpinnings

Linksvayer's research has consistently delved into the genetic and behavioral mechanisms underlying social insect colonies. He has investigated how social interactions affect the genetic basis and evolution of traits such as size, behavior, and caste identity. For example, his 2017 paper, "The neuropeptide corazonin controls social behavior and caste identity in ants," revealed the critical role of the neuropeptide corazonin in regulating social behavior and caste identity in ants.

#### Sociogenomics and Genomic Signatures

A significant theme in Linksvayer's work is the application of sociogenomic approaches to understand the evolution of social insect genomes. His paper, "Theoretical predictions for sociogenomic data: the effects of kin selection and sex-limited expression on the evolution of social insect genomes," co-authored with MJ Wade, provided theoretical predictions for how kin selection and sex-limited expression influence the evolution of social insect genomes.

#### Evolution of Cooperation and Mutualism

Linksvayer has also explored the evolution of cooperation and mutualism within and between species. His work aims to develop theoretical and empirical approaches to understand these evolutionary transitions, using genomic approaches to elucidate major evolutionary changes from solitary to highly social life and from single species to complex interspecific mutualisms.

### Methodologies

#### Genomic and Transcriptomic Analysis

Linksvayer's research often involves genomic and transcriptomic analyses to understand the molecular basis of social behavior. For instance, his study on "Genes associated with ant social behavior show distinct transcriptional and evolutionary patterns" used transcriptomic data to identify genes with unique evolutionary patterns associated with social behavior in ants.

#### Experimental and Field Studies

In addition to genomic analyses, Linksvayer has conducted extensive experimental and field studies. For example, his work on "Ant nurse workers exhibit behavioral and transcriptomic specialization on larval stage" involved both behavioral observations and transcriptomic analyses to understand the specialization of ant nurse workers.

### Key Findings and Breakthroughs

- **Genomic Signatures of Kin Selection**: Linksvayer's work has shown that genes associated with social behavior in ants exhibit distinct genomic signatures, influenced by kin selection and sex-limited expression.
- **Neuropeptide Control of Social Behavior**: The discovery of the neuropeptide corazonin's role in controlling social behavior and caste identity in ants is a significant breakthrough in understanding the molecular mechanisms of social behavior.
- **Evolution of Cooperation**: His research has provided insights into the evolution of cooperation and mutualism, highlighting the importance of genomic approaches in elucidating these evolutionary transitions.
