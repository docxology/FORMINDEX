## Grant Proposal Outline for NSF's Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE) Program

### Executive Summary

**Title:** Enhancing the Safety, Security, and Privacy of the Linux Kernel Open-Source Ecosystem

**Overview:**
This proposal seeks funding under the NSF's Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open-Source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE) program to address significant safety, security, and privacy vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel open-source ecosystem. The Linux Kernel is a critical component of modern computing, powering a vast array of devices from smartphones to servers. Our project aims to identify, mitigate, and prevent technical and socio-technical vulnerabilities, ensuring the long-term security and reliability of the Linux Kernel.

### Project Description

#### Background and Significance of the Chosen OSE
- **Introduction to the Linux Kernel:** The Linux Kernel is an open-source operating system kernel that is widely used in various devices and systems.
- **Importance:** The Linux Kernel is crucial for national and societal infrastructure, including cloud computing, embedded systems, and IoT devices.
- **Current Status:** Despite its widespread use, the Linux Kernel faces numerous security and privacy challenges, including vulnerabilities in code, side-channels, supply chain risks, and insider threats.

#### Identified Vulnerabilities and Their Potential Impacts
