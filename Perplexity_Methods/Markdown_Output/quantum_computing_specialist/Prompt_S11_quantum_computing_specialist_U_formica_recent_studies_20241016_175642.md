## Meta-Analysis of Recent Studies on the Genus Formica (2021-2023)

### Introduction

The genus *Formica*, comprising wood ants, has been a subject of extensive research due to their complex social structures, diverse foraging strategies, and intriguing interactions with other species. This meta-analysis synthesizes recent studies from 2021 to 2023, focusing on social organization, foraging strategies, and interactions with other species.

### Social Organization

#### Supergenes and Social Polymorphism

Studies have continued to elucidate the role of supergenes in determining social organization in *Formica* ants. A key finding is the presence of an ancient supergene that influences whether a colony is monogyne (single queen) or polygyne (multiple queens).

- **Formica francoeuri**: Research on *F. francoeuri* revealed polymorphism in colony social organization linked to genotypes within the *Formica* social supergene region. Workers in polygyne colonies were often heterozygous for alternative supergene haplotypes, and allele-specific expression of the *Knockout* gene was observed.
- **Supercoloniality**: Some *Formica* species exhibit supercoloniality, a derived social strategy characterized by genetic connectivity and resource sharing between neighboring nests. Interestingly, supercolonial populations often lack the polygyne-associated supergene haplotype, suggesting a distinct genetic mechanism for this social strategy.

#### Phylogenetic Context

Phylogenetic analyses have provided insights into the evolutionary history of *Formica* social structures.

- **Phylogenetic Relationships**: Studies have resolved the phylogenetic relationships among Palearctic *Formica* subgenera, indicating that parasitic colony founding is likely an intermediary step between free-living hosts and slave-maker parasites.

### Foraging Strategies

#### Microbiome and Nutrition

The microbiome of *Formica* ants has been found to play a crucial role in their nutrition and foraging strategies.

- **Phylosymbiosis**: *Formica* species harbor highly defined microbial communities dominated by *Wolbachia*, *Lactobacillus*, *Liliensternia*, and *Spiroplasma*. These microbiomes mirror the phylogeny of the host, indicating phylosymbiosis. The microbiome helps in digesting honeydew, a significant food source for many *Formica* species.

### Interactions with Other Species

#### Symbiotic and Parasitic Relationships

*Formica* ants engage in various symbiotic and parasitic relationships with other species.

- **Social Parasitism**: Many *Formica* species rely on socially parasitic strategies for colony founding, taking over colonies of other ants, particularly those in the *Serviformica* clades. This includes temporary social parasitism and slave-making behaviors.
- **Microbial Interactions**: The distinct microbial profiles of socially parasitic species and their hosts suggest that environmental acquisition or transfer between unrelated species does not significantly impact the microbiomes of *Formica* ants.

### Methodologies Employed

- **Genome-Wide Association Studies**: These studies have been used to assess markers associated with variation in colony social structure and to identify supergene haplotypes linked to social organization.
- **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Phylogenetic trees have been constructed to understand the evolutionary relationships among *Formica* subgenera and the distribution of microbial communities.
- **Population Genomic Data**: Sequencing workers from various colonies has provided insights into the genetic architecture of social organization and the distribution of supergene haplotypes.

### Significant Results and Impact

- **Genetic Basis of Social Organization**: The identification of supergenes and their role in determining social structures has significantly advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of social polymorphism in *Formica* ants.
- **Phylosymbiosis**: The discovery of phylosymbiosis in *Formica* ants highlights the importance of microbial communities in their biology and ecology.
- **Evolutionary History**: Phylogenetic studies have clarified the evolutionary history of *Formica* social structures and the origins of parasitic colony founding behaviors.

### Controversies and Debates

- **Supercoloniality Mechanisms**: The absence of the polygyne-associated supergene haplotype in supercolonial populations raises questions about the distinct genetic mechanisms underlying supercoloniality. This challenges the traditional view that polygyne and supercolonial social strategies are genetically linked.
- **Role of Microbiome**: While the microbiome is crucial for *Formica* nutrition, the exact mechanisms by which it influences social behavior and colony founding strategies are still under investigation and debate.
