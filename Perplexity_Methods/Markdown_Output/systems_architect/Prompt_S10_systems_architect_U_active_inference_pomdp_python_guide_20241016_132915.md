## Implementing an Active Inference POMDP Model in Python

### Executive Summary

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to implementing an Active Inference model using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in Python. It covers the key components of the model, including the generative model, variational free energy calculation, belief updating, and policy selection. A simple example scenario, such as a foraging task, is used to demonstrate the model's functionality.

### System Overview

Active Inference is a theoretical framework that integrates action, perception, and learning under the umbrella of Bayesian inference. Here, we use POMDPs to model the environment and the agent's behavior.

#### Key Components

- **Generative Model**: Describes the environment and the agent's interactions.
- **Variational Free Energy**: A cost function used for decision-making.
- **Belief Updating**: Updating the agent's beliefs based on observations.
- **Policy Selection**: Choosing actions to minimize free energy.

### Component Descriptions

#### Generative Model

The generative model is defined by the following components:

- **A**: Transition matrix (state transition probabilities)
- **B**: Observation matrix (observation probabilities given states)
- **C**: Observation likelihood matrix
- **D**: Prior state distribution

```python
import numpy as np

# Example: Transition matrix A
A = np.array([
    [0.7, 0.3],
    [0.4, 0.6]
])

# Example: Observation matrix B
B = np.array([
    [0.9, 0.1],
    [0.2, 0.8]
])

# Example: Observation likelihood matrix C
C = np.array([
    [0.8, 0.2],
    [0.1, 0.9]
])

# Example: Prior state distribution D
D = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

#### Variational Free Energy Calculation

Variational free energy is calculated using the following formula:

\[ F = E_q[\log q(s) - \log p(o, s)] \]

where \( q(s) \) is the approximate posterior distribution over states, and \( p(o, s) \) is the joint probability of observations and states.

```python
def calculate_free_energy(qs, obs_idx, A, B, C):
    # Calculate the expected free energy
    G = np.zeros(len(qs))
    for i in range(len(qs)):
        G[i] = -np.sum(qs * np.log(B[obs_idx, i] * qs[i] / qs[i]))
    return G
```

#### Belief Updating

Beliefs are updated using Bayesian inference:

\[ q(s) = \frac{p(o|s) \cdot p(s)}{\sum_s p(o|s) \cdot p(s)} \]

```python
def infer_states(obs_idx, A, prior):
    # Perform inference over hidden states
    qs = np.zeros(len(prior))
    for i in range(len(prior)):
        qs[i] = B[obs_idx, i] * prior[i]
    qs /= np.sum(qs)
    return qs
```

#### Policy Selection

Policies are selected based on the expected free energy of actions:

\[ Q_u = \text{softmax}(-G) \]

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_G(A, B, C, qs, actions):
    # Calculate the expected free energy of actions
    G = np.zeros(len(actions))
    for a in actions:
        G[a] = calculate_free_energy(qs, a, A, B, C)
    return G

def softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return e_x / e_x.sum()

def select_action(G):
    # Compute action posterior
    Q_u = softmax(-G)
    # Sample action from probability distribution over actions
    chosen_action = np.random.choice(len(Q_u), p=Q_u)
    return chosen_action
```

### Data Flow and Process Flow

Here is a step-by-step process flow for the Active Inference loop:

```plaintext
1. Initialize the environment and the agent's prior beliefs.
2. Observe the current state of the environment.
3. Update the agent's beliefs using Bayesian inference.
4. Calculate the expected free energy of actions.
5. Select an action based on the free energy.
6. Take the action and observe the new state.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 for the desired number of timesteps.
```

### Example Scenario: Foraging Task

Consider an agent in a simple grid-world environment where it needs to forage for food.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the environment
env = {
    'states': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)],
    'actions': ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right'],
    'rewards': {('food', 'found'): 10, ('food', 'not_found'): -1}
}

# Define the generative model
A = np.array([
    [0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3],
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6]
])

B = np.array([
    [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1],
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8]
])

C = np.array([
    [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.2],
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9]
])

D = np.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])

# Run the active inference loop
def run_active_inference_loop(A, B, C, D, actions, env, T=5):
    prior = D.copy()
    obs = env['states']
    for t in range(T):
        print(f'Time {t}: Agent observes itself in location: {obs}')
        obs_idx = env['states'].index(obs)
        qs_current = infer_states(obs_idx, A, prior)
        G = calculate_G(A, B, C, qs_current, actions)
        Q_u = softmax(-G)
        chosen_action = np.random.choice(len(Q_u), p=Q_u)
        action_label = actions[chosen_action]
        obs = env.step(action_label)
        prior = B[:, :, chosen_action].dot(qs_current)
    return qs_current

# Example usage
qs = run_active_inference_loop(A, B, C, D, env['actions'], env, T=5)
```
