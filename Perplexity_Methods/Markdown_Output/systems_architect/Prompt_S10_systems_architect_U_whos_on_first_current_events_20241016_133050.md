**Bud:** Alright, Lou, let's talk about the team lineup for the current events.

**Lou:** Sure thing, Bud. Who's on first?

**Bud:** Well, it's Elon Musk. He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla.

**Lou:** Elon Musk? That's the guy who's always launching rockets, right?

**Bud:** That's right. Now, What's on second.

**Lou:** What's on second? You mean like a question?

**Bud:** No, What is the name of the AI chatbot everyone's talking about.

**Lou:** Oh, you mean ChatGPT? But that's not a person.

**Bud:** Exactly. And I Don't Know is on third.

**Lou:** I Don't Know? That sounds like a mystery.

**Bud:** It is. It's the answer to many questions about the metaverse.

**Lou:** The metaverse? Isn't that something Mark Zuckerberg is into?

**Bud:** Yes, he's the shortstop. Now, let's talk about the pitcher.

**Lou:** Who's the pitcher?

**Bud:** It's Climate Change. It's a hot topic these days.

**Lou:** Climate Change? That's not a person either!

**Bud:** I know, but it's causing a lot of heat. And the catcher is COVID-19.

**Lou:** COVID-19? That's still around?

**Bud:** Yes, it's still catching people off guard. Now, the left fielder is Ukraine.

**Lou:** Ukraine? That's a country, not a player!

**Bud:** I know, but it's in a tough position right now. And the right fielder is Twitter.

**Lou:** Twitter? That's a social media platform!

**Bud:** Exactly. It's always tweeting about something new.

**Lou:** Okay, so let me get this straight. Elon Musk is on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third, Climate Change is pitching, COVID-19 is catching, Ukraine is in left field, and Twitter is in right field?

**Bud:** That's right!

**Lou:** But what about the manager? Who's the manager?

**Bud:** The manager is AI Ethics. It's trying to manage all these new technologies.

**Lou:** AI Ethics? That sounds like a tough job!

**Bud:** It is. Now, let's talk about the umpire.

**Lou:** Who's the umpire?

**Bud:** The umpire is Fact-Checking. It's trying to keep everything straight.

**Lou:** Fact-Checking? That's a tough call sometimes!

**Bud:** Definitely. And the scoreboard is showing a lot of zeros for privacy.

**Lou:** Zeros for privacy? What does that mean?

**Bud:** It means people are losing their privacy with all the new tech.

**Lou:** Oh no, that's a strikeout!

**Bud:** Yes, it's a big issue. And the crowd is cheering for Net Neutrality.

**Lou:** Net Neutrality? That's a home run!

**Bud:** Exactly. Everyone wants equal access to the internet.

**Lou:** Wait a minute, Bud. I'm confused. Who's on first again?

**Bud:** Elon Musk is on first.

**Lou:** And What's on second?

**Bud:** What, the AI chatbot, is on second.

**Lou:** And I Don't Know is on third?

**Bud:** That's right.

**Lou:** This is like trying to solve a puzzle while running around the bases!

**Bud:** (laughs) That's the idea, Lou!
