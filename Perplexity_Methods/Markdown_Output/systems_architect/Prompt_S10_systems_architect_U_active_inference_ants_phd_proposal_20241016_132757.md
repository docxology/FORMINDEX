### Executive Summary
This PhD dissertation proposal aims to explore the application of Active Inference (AI) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to understand the collective behavior of social insects, specifically ants. The research will integrate theoretical, empirical, and computational approaches to model and predict the behavior of ant colonies, contributing to fields such as complexity science, artificial intelligence, and collective intelligence.

- **Mathematical Formulation**: Describe the variational free energy and expected free energy, and how they are minimized in the context of Bayesian inference and decision-making.
- **Markov Blankets and Autonomous Systems**: Discuss the role of Markov blankets in separating internal and external states and how this relates to autonomous organization.

#### 1.2 Collective Behavior in Social Insects
- **Overview of Social Insect Biology**: Introduce the social structure, communication mechanisms, and cooperative behaviors of ants.
- **Current Theories of Collective Behavior**: Review existing theories such as swarm intelligence, self-organization, and game theory, highlighting their limitations and potential areas for improvement.

### 2. Research Questions
- **How can Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle be applied to model the collective behavior of ant colonies?**
- **What are the key parameters and mechanisms that influence the minimization of free energy in ant colonies?**
- **How do ants use sensory information and action to maintain their preferred states and avoid surprising situations?**
- **Can Active Inference models predict and explain observed patterns of behavior in ant colonies better than alternative theories?**

### 3. Proposed Methodologies
#### 3.1 Empirical Methods
- **Observational Studies**: Conduct detailed observations of ant colonies in controlled and natural environments to gather data on behavior, communication, and environmental interactions.
- **Experimental Manipulations**: Design experiments to manipulate environmental conditions, colony size, and communication pathways to observe how ants adapt and maintain their preferred states.
- **Neuroscience Techniques**: Use techniques such as optogenetics, electrophysiology, or neuroimaging to study the neural basis of ant behavior and decision-making.

#### 3.2 Computational Methods
- **Model Development**: Develop computational models based on Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to simulate ant colony behavior. Use probabilistic programming and message-passing algorithms to automate inference on dynamic models.
- **Simulation Studies**: Run simulations to test the predictive power of the models under various conditions and compare them with empirical data.
- **Comparison with Alternative Models**: Implement and compare the performance of Active Inference models against other theoretical models of collective behavior.

### 4. Expected Outcomes
- **Validation of Active Inference Models**: Demonstrate that Active Inference models can accurately predict and explain the collective behavior of ant colonies.
- **Identification of Key Parameters**: Determine the critical parameters and mechanisms that influence free energy minimization in ant colonies.
- **Insights into Decision-Making**: Gain a deeper understanding of how ants use sensory information and action to make decisions and maintain their preferred states.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Show whether Active Inference models outperform alternative theories in explaining and predicting ant colony behavior.

### 5. Potential Implications
#### 5.1 Complexity Science
- **Understanding Self-Organization**: Contribute to the understanding of self-organization and emergent behavior in complex systems.
- **Generalizability**: Explore the applicability of Active Inference to other complex biological and social systems.

#### 5.2 Artificial Intelligence
- **Inspiration for AI Algorithms**: Provide insights into how AI systems can be designed to mimic the adaptive and decision-making processes of biological agents.
- **Autonomous Systems**: Inform the development of autonomous systems that can interact effectively with their environment.

#### 5.3 Collective Intelligence
- **Enhancing Collective Decision-Making**: Offer new perspectives on how collective decision-making can be optimized in human and artificial systems.
- **Swarm Robotics**: Inspire new approaches in swarm robotics and distributed AI systems.

### 6. Innovative Experimental Designs
- **Combining Traditional Myrmecology with Neuroscience Techniques**: Use optogenetics to manipulate neural activity in ants while observing their behavior in controlled environments.
- **Environmental Manipulation**: Create dynamic environments that challenge ants to adapt and maintain their preferred states, using sensors and cameras to monitor behavior.
- **Multi-Agent Simulations**: Develop simulations that integrate empirical data with computational models to predict and analyze collective behavior.

### 7. Testing Active Inference Models Against Alternative Theories
- **Comparative Modeling**: Implement and compare the performance of Active Inference models with models based on swarm intelligence, game theory, and other relevant theories.
- **Experimental Validation**: Design experiments to test the predictions of different models and determine which model best explains the observed behavior.
