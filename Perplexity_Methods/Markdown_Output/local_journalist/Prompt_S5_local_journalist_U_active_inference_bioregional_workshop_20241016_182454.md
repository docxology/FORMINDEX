## Day 1: Theoretical Foundation and Mathematical Framework

### Morning Session (9:00 AM - 12:30 PM)
#### Introduction to Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle
- **Lecture**: Introduction to active inference, its history, and key concepts.
  - Definition: Active inference as a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence.
  - Free Energy Principle: Minimizing free energy as the underlying imperative.

```latex
F = E_q[\log q(\phi) - \log p(\phi, \mathbf{x})]
```

- **Discussion**: Relevance to bioregional management and ecological decision-making.

#### Key Equations and Interpretations
- **Lecture**: Mathematical framework of active inference.
  - Generative models: $p(\mathbf{x}, \phi)$
  - Inference: $q(\phi)$
  - Free energy: $F = E_q[\log q(\phi) - \log p(\phi, \mathbf{x})]$

```latex
\begin{align*}
F &= E_q[\log q(\phi) - \log p(\phi, \mathbf{x})] \\
&= E_q[\log q(\phi)] - E_q[\log p(\mathbf{x}, \phi)] \\
&= D_{KL}[q(\phi) || p(\phi | \mathbf{x})] - \log p(\mathbf{x})
\end{align*}
```

### Afternoon Session (1:30 PM - 5:00 PM)
#### Practical Examples Relevant to Bioregional Contexts

    # Simplified example
    mu, sigma = params
    return norm.pdf(data, loc=mu, scale=sigma)

def optimize_forest_health(params, data):
    # Simplified optimization
    fe = free_energy(norm.pdf(data, loc=params, scale=params), forest_health_model(params, data))
    return fe

# Example usage
