### 1. **Title and Abstract**
**Title:** "Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle in Collective Behavior of Social Insects: A Study on Ants"
**Abstract:**
This PhD dissertation proposes to apply the Active Inference framework and the Free Energy Principle to understand the collective behavior of social insects, specifically focusing on ants. The research aims to integrate theoretical models from neuroscience and complexity science with empirical and computational methodologies to elucidate how ants optimize their behavior to maintain homeostasis and achieve collective goals. The study will explore the implications of these findings for fields such as artificial intelligence, collective intelligence, and complexity science.
