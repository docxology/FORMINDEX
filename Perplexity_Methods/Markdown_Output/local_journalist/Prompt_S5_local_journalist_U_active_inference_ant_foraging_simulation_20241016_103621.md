## Active Inference Model for Ant Foraging Behavior

### Overview

This Python program implements a simple Active Inference model to simulate ant foraging behavior. The model incorporates key aspects of Active Inference, including belief updating, policy selection, and free energy minimization. We will use object-oriented programming to create an `Ant` class with appropriate attributes and methods.

### Dependencies and Imports

```python
import numpy as np
import random

# For visualization (optional)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Ant Class

The `Ant` class will encapsulate the state and behavior of an individual ant.

```python
class Ant:
    def __init__(self, x, y, environment):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.environment = environment
        self.beliefs = np.zeros((environment.size, environment.size))  # Beliefs about food sources
        self.beliefs[x, y] = 1.0  # Initial belief at the starting position
        self.policy = None  # Policy for movement
        self.free_energy = float('inf')  # Initial free energy

    def generate_sensory_observations(self):
        # Simulate sensory observations based on the ant's current position
        observations = np.zeros((self.environment.size, self.environment.size))
        if self.environment.food_sources[self.x, self.y]:
            observations[self.x, self.y] = 1.0
        return observations

    def update_beliefs(self, observations):
        # Update beliefs based on sensory observations
        self.beliefs = np.where(observations > 0, observations, self.beliefs * 0.9)

    def select_policy(self):
        # Select a policy based on the current beliefs and environment
        # For simplicity, choose the direction with the highest belief
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Left, Down, Up
        best_direction = max(directions, key=lambda d: self.beliefs[self.x + d, self.y + d])
        self.policy = best_direction

    def move(self):
        # Move according to the selected policy
        dx, dy = self.policy
        new_x, new_y = self.x + dx, self.y + dy
        if 0 <= new_x < self.environment.size and 0 <= new_y < self.environment.size:
            self.x, self.y = new_x, new_y

    def calculate_free_energy(self):
        # Calculate free energy based on the current beliefs and policy
        # Simplified version: free energy is inversely proportional to the belief at the current position
        self.free_energy = -np.log(self.beliefs[self.x, self.y])
```

### Environment Class

The `Environment` class will represent the 2D environment where ants forage.

```python
class Environment:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.food_sources = np.zeros((size, size))  # Randomly place food sources
        for _ in range(size // 2):
            self.food_sources[random.randint(0, size-1), random.randint(0, size-1)] = 1.0
```

### Main Function

The main function will run a simulation of multiple ants foraging in the 2D environment.

```python
def main():
    environment_size = 20
    num_ants = 10
    num_steps = 100

    environment = Environment(environment_size)
    ants = [Ant(random.randint(0, environment_size-1), random.randint(0, environment_size-1), environment) for _ in range(num_ants)]

    for step in range(num_steps):
        for ant in ants:
            observations = ant.generate_sensory_observations()
            ant.update_beliefs(observations)
            ant.select_policy()
            ant.move()
            ant.calculate_free_energy()

        # Optional: Visualize the environment and ants
        # plt.imshow(environment.food_sources, cmap='binary')
        # for ant in ants:
        #     plt.scatter(ant.y, ant.x, c='r')
        # plt.pause(0.01)
        # plt.clf()

    # Print final positions and free energies of ants
    for i, ant in enumerate(ants):
        print(f"Ant {i+1}: Position ({ant.x}, {ant.y}), Free Energy: {ant.free_energy}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation and Extensions

- **Belief Updating**: The `update_beliefs` method updates the ant's beliefs based on sensory observations. This is a simplified version and can be extended to incorporate more complex Bayesian inference.
- **Policy Selection**: The `select_policy` method chooses the direction with the highest belief. This can be improved by using more sophisticated decision-making processes, such as those involving expected free energy.
- **Free Energy Minimization**: The `calculate_free_energy` method calculates the free energy based on the current beliefs. This can be refined to include other factors such as the cost of movement and the value of food sources.
- **Visualization**: The optional visualization code can be uncommented to see the movement of ants in the environment.
- **Extensions**:
  - **Multi-Pheromone Model**: Incorporate multiple pheromones for exploration and food gathering as described in.
  - **Stigmergic Regulation**: Integrate stigmergic outcomes where ants deposit pheromone trails to guide other ants.
  - **Complex Environments**: Use more complex environments with obstacles and varying food source distributions.
  - **Learning and Adaptation**: Implement learning mechanisms where ants adapt their policies based on past experiences.

This basic model provides a foundation for simulating ant foraging behavior using Active Inference principles. It can be extended and refined to capture more realistic and complex behaviors of ant colonies.
