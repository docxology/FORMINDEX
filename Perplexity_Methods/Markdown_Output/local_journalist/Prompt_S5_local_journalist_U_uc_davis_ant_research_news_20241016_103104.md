## Recent Ant-Related Research at UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology

### Significant Findings and Publications

#### Discovery of a New Genus of Fossil Ants
In a groundbreaking study published in 2022, researchers led by Brendon Boudinot, a former PhD student under Professor Phil Ward, discovered a new genus of primordial ants, "†_Desyopone hereon_ gen. et sp. nov."
- This discovery involved advanced 3D-imaging technology using synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-µ-CT) to analyze fossilized male ants from the Miocene epoch.
- The study led to a revision of ant classification at the subfamily level and highlighted the importance of male ants in understanding ant evolution.

#### Advances in Ant Systematics and Phylogeny
Professor Phil Ward continues to be at the forefront of ant systematics and phylogeny. His work involves both morphological and molecular methods to understand the evolutionary history of ants.
- Ward's lab has transitioned to phylogenomic approaches, analyzing thousands of genes to provide more detailed and resolved phylogenies.
- This work emphasizes the integration of molecular and morphological methods for species delimitation and phylogenetic analysis.

### Ongoing Studies and Collaborations

#### Ants of California
The Ward Lab is actively studying the ant fauna of California, which includes 8 subfamilies, 44 genera, and approximately 300 species, with about 25% of the native species being endemic to the state.
- This research aims to understand the diversity and evolutionary history of California's ant species.

#### International Collaborations
The discovery of the new genus "†_Desyopone hereon_" involved an international team of researchers from Friedrich Schiller University Jena, the University of Rennes, the University of Gdansk, and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon in Geesthacht, Germany.
- Such collaborations underscore the global nature of myrmecological research and the importance of interdisciplinary approaches.

### Notable Achievements and Recognition

#### Awards and Fellowships
Brendon Boudinot, who worked under Professor Phil Ward, received the John Henry Comstock Award from the Pacific Branch, Entomological Society of America, and was awarded a Peter S. Buck Research Fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution.
- These recognitions highlight the excellence and impact of research conducted by UC Davis myrmecologists.

#### Grants and Funding
The Vannette Lab, while primarily focused on microbial ecology, has received significant funding, including a CAREER grant from the National Science Foundation to study nectar chemistry and its ecological and evolutionary tradeoffs.
- Although not exclusively focused on ants, this research can have broader implications for understanding the ecological interactions involving ants and other organisms.

### Implications for Local and Global Ant Biology and Ecology

#### Local Implications
- The study of California's ant fauna helps in understanding the ecological roles of ants in local ecosystems and their contribution to biodiversity.
- This research can inform conservation efforts and management practices in California, particularly for endemic species.

#### Global Implications
- The discovery of new ant genera and the revision of ant classification have global implications for understanding ant evolution and diversity.
- Advanced methods such as phylogenomics and 3D-imaging technology are transforming the field of myrmecology, enabling more precise and detailed studies of ant biology worldwide.

### Conclusion

The UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology continues to be a hub for innovative and impactful research in myrmecology. The integration of morphological and molecular methods, international collaborations, and significant recognitions and funding highlight the department's commitment to advancing our understanding of ant ecology, behavior, and evolution.
