## Workshop Outline

### 1. Theoretical Foundation (1 hour)
#### Introduction to Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle
- **Definition and Background**:
  - Active inference as a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence.
  - The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its role in minimizing free energy.
  ```latex
  F = E_q[\log q(\phi) - \log p(\phi, \mathbf{s})]
  ```
  Where \( F \) is the free energy, \( q(\phi) \) is the approximate posterior distribution, and \( p(\phi, \mathbf{s}) \) is the true joint distribution of parameters and states.

- **Relevance to Bioregional Management**:
  - How active inference can be applied to ecological decision-making and resource management.

#### Group Discussion: Applications in Bioregional Management
- Discuss potential bioregional challenges where active inference could be beneficial (e.g., water resource management, forest conservation).

### 2. Mathematical Framework (1.5 hours)
#### Key Equations and Interpretations
- **Free Energy Minimization**:
  - Derivation of the free energy equation and its components.
  ```latex
  F = E_q[\log q(\phi) - \log p(\phi, \mathbf{s})] = E_q[\log q(\phi)] - E_q[\log p(\mathbf{s}|\phi)] - \log p(\phi)
  ```
  Where the first term is the entropy of the approximate posterior, the second term is the expected log-likelihood, and the third term is the log-prior.

- **Action and Perception**:
  - How actions and perceptions are integrated to minimize free energy.
  ```latex
  \Delta F = E_q[\log q(\mathbf{a}) - \log p(\mathbf{a}|\mathbf{s})]
  ```
  Where \( \mathbf{a} \) represents actions.

#### Practical Examples
- **Water Resource Management**:
  - Example of how active inference can be used to manage water resources sustainably, balancing immediate needs with long-term availability.

### 3. Computational Implementation (2 hours)
#### Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing Active Inference Models in Python
- **Setting Up the Environment**:
  - Installing necessary libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`).
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import scipy as sp
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  ```

- **Implementing the Free Energy Principle**:
  - Basic code structure for minimizing free energy.
  ```python
  def free_energy(q_phi, p_phi_s, p_phi):
      return np.mean(np.log(q_phi) - np.log(p_phi_s)) - np.log(p_phi)
  ```

- **Code Examples for Bioregional Case Studies**
  - Example code for a simple water resource management model.
  ```python
  def water_resource_management(state, action, prior_preferences):
      # Simulate the environment dynamics
      next_state = simulate_environment(state, action)
      # Calculate the free energy
      free_energy = free_energy(next_state, prior_preferences)
      return next_state, free_energy
  ```

### 4. Data Collection and Preprocessing (1.5 hours)
#### Techniques for Gathering Relevant Bioregional Data
- **Data Sources**:
  - Discuss various sources of bioregional data (e.g., sensor data, satellite imagery, community surveys).

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
  - Steps for cleaning and preprocessing data for active inference models.
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  def clean_data(data):
      # Remove missing values
      data.dropna(inplace=True)
      # Normalize the data
      data = (data - data.mean()) / data.std()
      return data
  ```

### 5. Model Building and Simulation (2 hours)
#### Constructing Generative Models for Bioregional Systems
- **Defining the Generative Model**:
  - How to construct a generative model that captures the dynamics of a bioregional system.
  ```python
  def generative_model(state, action):
      # Simulate the environment dynamics
      next_state = simulate_environment(state, action)
      return next_state
  ```

- **Running Simulations and Interpreting Results**
  - How to run simulations using the generative model and interpret the results.
  ```python
  def run_simulation(initial_state, actions, steps):
      states = [initial_state]
      for action in actions:
          next_state = generative_model(states[-1], action)
          states.append(next_state)
      return states
  ```

### 6. Case Studies (2 hours)
#### Detailed Examples of Active Inference Applied to Real-World Bioregional Challenges
- **Forest Conservation**:
  - Example of using active inference to balance forest conservation with economic activities.
  - Group exercises to work through the case study.

#### Group Exercises

- **Challenges and Solutions**:
  - Discuss potential challenges and solutions for integrating active inference into existing management practices.

- **Decision-Making Frameworks**:
