```markdown
**Bud:** Alright, Lou, let's talk about the team.

**Lou:** Sure thing, Bud. Who's on first?

**Bud:** Well, it's Elon Musk. He's the first baseman.

**Lou:** Elon Musk? Isn't he the guy running Twitter?

**Bud:** That's right. But on the field, he's on first.

**Lou:** So, Elon Musk is on first. What's on second?

**Bud:** That's Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. He's on second base.

**Lou:** Mark Zuckerberg? I thought he was dealing with AI issues.

**Bud:** Yes, but here, he's What's on second.

**Lou:** Okay, so Elon Musk is on first, Mark Zuckerberg is on second. Who's on third?

**Bud:** That's I Don't Know, the new AI chatbot.

**Lou:** I Don't Know? How can I not know who's on third?

**Bud:** It's just his name. I Don't Know is on third.

**Lou:** This is confusing. So, Elon Musk is on first, Mark Zuckerberg is on second, and I Don't Know is on third. What about the pitcher?

**Bud:** The pitcher's name is Tomorrow. He's pitching tomorrow.

**Lou:** Tomorrow? That's not a name!

**Bud:** It is for our team. Tomorrow is pitching tomorrow.

**Lou:** And the catcher?

**Bud:** The catcher's name is Today. Today is catching today.

**Lou:** Today and Tomorrow? This is crazy!

**Bud:** Just go with it. Now, the left fielder is named Why.

**Lou:** Why? Why is he named Why?

**Bud:** Because that's his name. Why is in left field.

**Lou:** So, Elon Musk is on first, Mark Zuckerberg is on second, I Don't Know is on third, Tomorrow is pitching, Today is catching, and Why is in left field. What about the shortstop?

**Bud:** The shortstop's name is MetaVerse.

**Lou:** MetaVerse? That sounds like a virtual world!

**Bud:** Yes, but here, he's our shortstop.

**Lou:** Alright, let's recap: Elon Musk on first, Mark Zuckerberg on second, I Don't Know on third, Tomorrow pitching, Today catching, Why in left field, and MetaVerse at shortstop. Who's the manager?

**Bud:** The manager's name is Biden.

**Lou:** Biden? As in Joe Biden?

**Bud:** Yes, but here, he's just the manager.

**Lou:** So, Biden is the manager. What about the umpire?

**Bud:** The umpire's name is FactCheck.

**Lou:** FactCheck? That sounds like something from social media!

**Bud:** Yes, but here, he's calling the shots.

**Lou:** This is too much Elon Musk on first, Mark Zuckerberg on second, I Don't Know on third, Tomorrow pitching, Today catching, Why in left field, MetaVerse at shortstop, Biden managing, and FactCheck umpiring. How can I keep track?

**Bud:** Just remember: Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third.

**Lou:** (frustrated) Third base!

**Bud:** (laughing) That's right, Lou. Third base!
