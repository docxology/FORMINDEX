## PhD Dissertation Proposal: Applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to Study Collective Behavior in Social Insects (Focus on Ants)

### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Background**: Brief overview of the importance of understanding collective behavior in social insects, particularly ants.
   - **Research Gap**: Identification of the current gaps in understanding the mechanisms behind collective behavior and the potential of using Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to address these gaps.
   - **Objectives**: Outline the main objectives of the dissertation, including the application of Active Inference and FEP to explain collective behavior, and the integration of empirical and computational methodologies.

### 2. **Theoretical Background**
   - **Active Inference and Free Energy Principle**:
     - Definition and explanation of Active Inference and FEP.
     - How these principles minimize variational free energy and optimize behavior.
     - Role of Bayesian inference, expected free energy, and epistemic value.
   - **Collective Behavior in Social Insects**:
     - Overview of current theories and models explaining collective behavior in ants (e.g., swarm intelligence, self-organization).
     - Discussion of the complexity and adaptability of ant colonies.
   - **Intersection of Active Inference and Collective Behavior**:
     - How Active Inference can be applied to understand decision-making and action selection at the individual and collective levels.
     - Theoretical framework for integrating FEP with existing models of collective behavior.

### 3. **Research Questions**
   - **Primary Questions**:
     - How do individual ants use Active Inference to minimize free energy and make decisions that contribute to collective behavior?
     - Can the FEP explain the emergence of complex collective behaviors in ant colonies?
     - What are the key parameters and processes in Active Inference models that influence collective outcomes?
   - **Secondary Questions**:
     - How do environmental factors and social interactions influence the free energy minimization process in ants?
     - Can Active Inference models predict and explain different types of collective behaviors (e.g., foraging, nest building, defense)?

### 4. **Proposed Methodologies**
   #### Empirical Methods
   - **Observational Studies**:
     - Detailed observations of ant colonies under various conditions to collect data on individual and collective behavior.
   - **Experimental Manipulations**:
     - Design experiments to alter environmental conditions or social structures to observe changes in collective behavior.
   - **Neuroscience Techniques**:
     - Use of neurophysiological methods (e.g., electrophysiology, imaging) to study neural activity related to decision-making in ants.
   #### Computational Methods
   - **Active Inference Modeling**:
     - Development of computational models based on Active Inference to simulate individual and collective behavior in ants.
   - **Simulation Studies**:
     - Use of simulations to test hypotheses and predict outcomes under different scenarios.
   - **Model Validation**:
     - Comparison of model predictions with empirical data to validate the models.

### 5. **Innovative Experimental Designs**
   - **Combining Traditional Myrmecology with Neuroscience**:
     - Integrating classical ant colony observations with modern neuroscience techniques to study neural correlates of decision-making.
   - **Real-Time Tracking and Feedback Systems**:
     - Using real-time tracking systems to monitor individual ants and provide feedback to manipulate their environment dynamically.
   - **Mixed Reality Environments**:
     - Creating mixed reality environments to study how ants adapt to changing conditions and make collective decisions.

### 6. **Testing Active Inference Models Against Alternative Theories**
   - **Comparison with Swarm Intelligence Models**:
     - Testing Active Inference models against traditional swarm intelligence models to see which better explains observed behaviors.
   - **Evaluation Against Self-Organization Theories**:
     - Comparing the predictive power of Active Inference with self-organization theories in explaining collective behavior.
   - **Statistical Analysis and Model Selection**:
     - Using statistical methods to compare the fit of different models to empirical data and select the most accurate one.

### 7. **Expected Outcomes**
   - **Insights into Collective Decision-Making**:
     - A deeper understanding of how individual ants use Active Inference to contribute to collective behaviors.
   - **Validation of Active Inference Models**:
     - Empirical validation of Active Inference models in explaining collective behavior in ants.
   - **Contributions to Theoretical Frameworks**:
     - Advancements in the theoretical frameworks of Active Inference and FEP as applied to collective behavior.

### 8. **Potential Implications**
   - **Complexity Science**:
     - Insights into how complex systems can self-organize and maintain homeostasis through free energy minimization.
   - **Artificial Intelligence**:
     - Development of more adaptive and autonomous AI systems inspired by biological principles of Active Inference.
   - **Collective Intelligence**:
     - Understanding how collective intelligence emerges from individual decision-making processes, applicable to human and artificial systems.

### 9. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of the proposed research and its significance.
   - Future directions and potential extensions of the research.
