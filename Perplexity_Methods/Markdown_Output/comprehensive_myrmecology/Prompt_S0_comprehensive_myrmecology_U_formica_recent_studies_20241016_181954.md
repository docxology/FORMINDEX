## Meta-Analysis of Recent Studies on the Genus Formica (2021-2023)

### Social Organization

#### Queen Number and Supergenes

Recent studies have delved deeply into the genetic basis of social organization in _Formica_ ants, particularly focusing on the role of supergenes.

- **Queen Number Supergene**: Research has shown that a ancient supergene, approximately 30 million years old, determines whether a _Formica_ colony is monogyne or polygyne. Workers in polygyne colonies typically have at least one P haplotype, while those in monogyne colonies are almost exclusively homozygous for the M haplotype.
  - A study by Brelsford et al. (2020) and further elaborated by Lagunas-Robles et al. (2021) and Scarparo et al. (2023) highlighted the genetic linkage between dispersal ability and social traits, which is crucial for understanding social polymorphisms in _Formica_.

- **Supercoloniality**: Supercoloniality, an exaggerated form of polydomous, polygynous social organization, has been observed in several _Formica_ species. This strategy allows for genetic connectivity and resource sharing between neighboring nests. However, the supergene haplotype associated with polygyny is often absent or rare in highly polygynous supercolonial populations, suggesting a distinct genetic mechanism for supercoloniality.

#### Phylogenetic and Evolutionary Aspects

- **Phylogenetic Relationships**: A study by Romiguier et al. (2018) resolved the phylogenetic relationships among Palearctic _Formica_ subgenera, indicating that parasitic colony founding is likely an intermediary step between free-living hosts and slave-maker parasites in the _Formica_ genus.

- **Evolution of Social Parasitism**: The evolution of social parasitism in _Formica_ ants has been extensively studied. A global phylogeny of _Formica_ ants revealed that obligate dependent colony-founding behavior arose once from a facultatively polygynous common ancestor. Temporary social parasitism likely preceded or arose concurrently with obligate dependent colony founding, and dulotic social parasitism evolved once within the obligate dependent colony-founding clade.

### Foraging Strategies

#### Off-Nest Activity and Aggressiveness

- **Dynamic Density and Movement Intensity**: A study on _Formica lemani_ focused on the off-nest activity and aggressiveness of foragers. The dynamic density of foragers was higher within the territory of the nest complex compared to areas beyond. The intensity of movement on trees and the aggressiveness of foragers also varied significantly between these areas.

- **Trophobiotic Relationships**: _Formica lemani_ exhibits trophobiotic relationships with aphids, particularly _Chaitophorus populeti_ on aspen trees. The aggressiveness of foragers towards aphids was found to be lower within the nest complex territory compared to outside areas.

#### Foraging Trails and Resource Utilization

- **Nest Complex Characteristics**: The nest complex of _Formica lemani_ includes over 150 large nests, with most located at the bases of birch trees or inside logs. A pronounced network of surface trails and exchange trails between nests was observed, indicating efficient resource utilization and communication.

### Interactions with Other Species

#### Social Parasitism and Slave-Making

- **Slave-Making and Host Relationships**: Several _Formica_ species are known to be slave-makers or hosts. For example, _Formica fossaceps_ is a slave-maker of _Formica montana_, while _Formica fukaii_ is a host for _Polyergus samurai_.

- **Trophobiotic and Xenobiotic Relationships**: Besides aphids, _Formica_ ants interact with various other species. For instance, _Formica occulta_ has xenobiotic relationships with species like _Lasius latipes_ and _Myrmica hamulata_.

### Methodologies Employed

- **Field Observations and Experiments**: Studies on _Formica_ ants often involve detailed field observations, such as measuring dynamic density and movement intensity of foragers, and experiments to assess aggressiveness and trophobiotic relationships.
- **Genetic Analysis**: Genetic studies, including phylogenetic reconstructions and genome-wide association studies, have been crucial in understanding the genetic basis of social organization and evolutionary transitions in _Formica_ ants.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical methods, such as the Mann-Whitney U Test, are used to compare data from different groups, like the aggressiveness of foragers within and outside the nest complex territory.

### Significant Results and Impact

- **Genetic Basis of Social Organization**: The discovery of supergenes and their role in determining queen number and social organization has significantly advanced our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying social polymorphisms in _Formica_ ants.
- **Evolutionary Insights**: The reconstruction of the global phylogeny of _Formica_ ants has provided insights into the evolution of social parasitism and the transitions between different social strategies.
- **Ecological Importance**: Studies on foraging strategies and interactions with other species highlight the ecological importance of _Formica_ ants in their ecosystems, including their role in managing aphid populations and their complex social interactions.

### Controversies and Debates

- **Origin of Supercoloniality**: There is ongoing debate about the origin and genetic mechanism of supercoloniality in _Formica_ ants. The absence of the supergene haplotype associated with polygyny in supercolonial populations suggests a distinct genetic basis, but more research is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.
- **Evolution of Social Parasitism**: The exact pathways and conditions leading to the evolution of social parasitism in _Formica_ ants are still under investigation. Different studies suggest various scenarios, including the role of temporary social parasitism and dulotic social parasitism.
