### Workshop Outline

#### Day 1: Theoretical Foundation and Mathematical Framework

##### Morning Session (9:00 AM - 12:30 PM)

## Theoretical Foundation
### Introduction to Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle

- **Definition and Concept**: Active inference as a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence and decision-making.
  ```markdown
  Active inference is based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which posits that biological systems act to minimize free energy, a measure of the difference between the expected and actual sensory inputs.
  ```

- **Relevance to Bioregional Management**: How active inference can be applied to ecological decision-making and bioregional management.
  ```markdown
  Bioregional management involves complex decision-making that can be optimized using active inference, which helps in balancing immediate needs with long-term sustainability.
  ```

## Mathematical Framework
### Key Equations and Interpretations

- **Free Energy Equation**:
  \[
  F = E_q[\log q(\phi) - \log p(\phi, \mathbf{x})]
  \]
  Where \( F \) is the free energy, \( q(\phi) \) is the approximate posterior distribution, and \( p(\phi, \mathbf{x}) \) is the true joint distribution of the parameters and observations.

- **Action and Perception**:
  \[
  \Delta F = E_q[\log q(\mathbf{a}) - \log p(\mathbf{a}|\phi)]
  \]
  Where \( \mathbf{a} \) represents actions, and \( p(\mathbf{a}|\phi) \) is the likelihood of actions given parameters.

##### Afternoon Session (1:30 PM - 5:00 PM)

## Practical Examples Relevant to Bioregional Contexts

- **Water Resource Management**: Using active inference to optimize water consumption and conservation.
  ```markdown
  Example: An agent learning to manage water resources by balancing current consumption with future availability in a dynamic environment.
  ```

- **Forest Conservation**: Applying active inference to decide on forest management strategies.
  ```markdown
  Example: An agent adapting its behavior to conserve forest resources while considering both immediate and long-term ecological impacts.
  ```

#### Day 2: Computational Implementation and Data Collection

##### Morning Session (9:00 AM - 12:30 PM)

## Computational Implementation
### Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing Active Inference Models in Python

- **Setting Up the Environment**:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import scipy as sp
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  ```

- **Defining the Free Energy Function**:
  ```python
  def free_energy(q_phi, p_phi_x):
      return np.mean(q_phi * np.log(q_phi) - q_phi * np.log(p_phi_x))
  ```

- **Implementing Action and Perception Updates**:
  ```python
  def update_action(q_a, p_a_phi):
      return np.mean(q_a * np.log(q_a) - q_a * np.log(p_a_phi))
  ```

## Code Examples for Bioregional Case Studies

- **Water Resource Management Example**:
  ```python
  # Simulate water resource dynamics
  def water_resource_dynamics(action, current_state):
      # Simple linear dynamics for demonstration
      return current_state + action

  # Define the agent's prior preferences
  def prior_preferences(state):
      # Example prior preferring balanced water levels
      return -np.abs(state - 50)

  # Run the simulation
  state = 0
  actions = []
  for t in range(100):
      action = np.random.uniform(-10, 10)
      state = water_resource_dynamics(action, state)
      actions.append(action)
  ```

#### Day 3: Model Building, Simulation, and Case Studies

##### Morning Session (9:00 AM - 12:30 PM)

## Model Building and Simulation
### Constructing Generative Models for Bioregional Systems

- **Defining the Generative Model**:
  \[
  p(\phi, \mathbf{x}) = p(\phi) \cdot p(\mathbf{x}|\phi)
  \]
  Where \( p(\phi) \) is the prior distribution over parameters, and \( p(\mathbf{x}|\phi) \) is the likelihood of observations given parameters.
