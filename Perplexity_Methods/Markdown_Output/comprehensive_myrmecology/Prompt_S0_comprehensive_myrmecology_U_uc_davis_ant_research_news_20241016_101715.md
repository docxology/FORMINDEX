## Recent Ant-Related Research at UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology (2020-2024)

### Overview of Research Areas

The UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology is a hub for diverse and cutting-edge research in entomology, including myrmecology. Here, we focus on recent projects, publications, and news related to ant ecology, behavior, and evolution.

## Key Researchers and Labs

### Philip S. Ward Lab

- **Ant Systematics and Phylogeny**: Professor Philip S. Ward, a renowned myrmecologist, has been actively involved in various projects related to ant systematics and phylogeny. His work includes species-level taxonomy and molecular phylogenetics of selected ant groups, such as the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae and the tribe Camponotini.
- **Collaborations**: Ward collaborates with other researchers, including Jack Longino, to study the ants of Central America and other regions.

## Significant Findings and Publications

### Ant Taxonomy and Phylogeny

- **Phylogenomic Approaches**: Ward's lab has transitioned to phylogenomic approaches, analyzing thousands of genes to provide more detailed and resolved phylogenies. This method has proven superior to earlier molecular and morphological methods alone.
- **Morphological and Molecular Methods**: The integration of morphological and molecular methods is highlighted as crucial for species-level taxonomy and phylogenetic studies. Ward emphasizes the importance of morphology in identifying species while acknowledging the power of molecular markers in generating phylogenies.

### Ant Ecology and Behavior

- **Ant Fauna of California**: Research from the Ward Lab has detailed the ant fauna of California, which includes 8 subfamilies, 44 genera, and approximately 300 species, with about 25% of the native species being endemic to the state or the California Floristic Province.

## Ongoing Studies and Collaborations

### Vannette Lab

While the Vannette Lab primarily focuses on microbial communities and their interactions with plants and insects, there are indirect implications for ant ecology:

- **Microbial Communities**: Studies on microbial communities in flowers and on insects can provide insights into the ecological roles of ants in these environments. For example, research on nectar microbiome and its effects on pollinators can indirectly inform about the interactions between ants and other organisms in shared ecosystems.

### Departmental Research Areas

- **Biodiversity and Ecology**: The department's research is grouped into broad areas, including biodiversity and ecology. These areas encompass studies on ant populations, their ecological importance, and their interactions with other organisms.

## Notable Achievements, Grants, and Recognition

- **Grants and Funding**: The National Science Foundation has funded several projects within the department, including a CAREER grant awarded to Rachel Vannette for her work on "Nectar chemistry and ecological and evolutionary tradeoffs in plant adaptation to microbes and pollinators".
- **Publications and Presentations**: Several papers from the Vannette Lab have been published in prestigious journals such as *Microbiome*, *Environmental Microbiology*, and *ISME Journal*. These publications highlight the department's active research and contribution to scientific knowledge.

## Implications for Local and Global Ant Biology and Ecology

### Local Implications

- **Conservation and Biodiversity**: The detailed study of the ant fauna of California and other regions helps in understanding local biodiversity and the ecological roles of ants. This information is crucial for conservation efforts and managing ecosystems effectively.
- **Ecological Importance**: Understanding the interactions between ants and other organisms, such as plants and microbes, provides insights into the complex ecological networks within local ecosystems.

### Global Implications

- **Global Phylogenies**: The phylogenomic studies conducted by Ward's lab contribute to a global understanding of ant evolution and diversity. These findings can be applied to broader evolutionary questions and help in understanding the global distribution and adaptation of ant species.
- **Comparative Ecology**: Comparative studies of ant ecology across different regions can reveal universal principles and unique adaptations, enhancing our understanding of ant biology on a global scale.

## Conclusion

The UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology continues to be a leading institution in ant-related research, with significant contributions to our understanding of ant taxonomy, ecology, and evolution. The integration of morphological and molecular methods, along with interdisciplinary collaborations, has advanced our knowledge in these areas.
