### Workshop Outline

#### Day 1: Theoretical Foundation and Mathematical Framework

##### Morning Session (9:00 AM - 12:30 PM)

###### Introduction to Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle
- **Lecture**: Introduction to active inference, its roots in the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and its relevance to biological and artificial systems.
  ```markdown
  - **Key Concept**: Minimizing free energy as a unifying principle for perception and action.
  - **Mathematical Notation**:
    \[
    F = E_q[\log p(\mathbf{o}, \mathbf{s}) - \log q(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{o})]
    \]
    Where \( F \) is the free energy, \( p(\mathbf{o}, \mathbf{s}) \) is the joint probability of observations and states, and \( q(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{o}) \) is the approximate posterior distribution.

###### Relevance to Bioregional Management and Ecological Decision-Making
- **Discussion**: How active inference can be applied to bioregional management challenges such as resource allocation, conservation, and decision-making under uncertainty.

##### Afternoon Session (1:30 PM - 5:00 PM)

###### Key Equations and Interpretations
- **Lecture**: Detailed explanation of the key equations in active inference, including the variational free energy and the action-perception cycle.
  ```markdown
  - **Variational Free Energy**:
    \[
    F = E_q[\log p(\mathbf{o}, \mathbf{s}) - \log q(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{o})]
    \]
  - **Action-Perception Cycle**:
    \[
    \Delta F = E_q[\log p(\mathbf{o}, \mathbf{s}) - \log q(\mathbf{s}|\mathbf{o})] + E_q[\log p(\mathbf{a}|\mathbf{s})]
    \]
    Where \( \mathbf{a} \) represents actions.
