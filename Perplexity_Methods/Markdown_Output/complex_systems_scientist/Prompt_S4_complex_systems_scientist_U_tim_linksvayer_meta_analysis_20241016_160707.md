## Career Meta-Analysis of Professor Timothy A. Linksvayer

### Overview of Research Focus

Professor Timothy A. Linksvayer's research career is marked by a consistent focus on the genetic, developmental, and behavioral underpinnings of social insect colonies, particularly ants. Here are the major themes and evolution of his research focus:

#### Early Career: Foundations in Evolutionary Genetics and Social Insects
- Linksvayer's early work, such as "The evolutionary origin and elaboration of sociality in the aculeate Hymenoptera: maternal effects, sib-social effects, and heterochrony" (2005), laid the groundwork for understanding the evolutionary origins of sociality in insects.
- He explored the roles of kin selection, sex-limited expression, and genetic effects on individual and colony traits in ants.

#### Mid-Career: Genomics and Sociogenomics
- Linksvayer transitioned to incorporating genomics and sociogenomics in his research. For example, "Genomic signature of kin selection in an ant with obligately sterile workers" (2017) and "Theoretical predictions for sociogenomic data: the effects of kin selection and sex-limited expression on the evolution of social insect genomes" (2016) highlight his use of genomic data to understand social behavior.
- He also investigated the transcriptional and evolutionary patterns of genes associated with ant social behavior.

#### Recent Work: Behavioral and Developmental Genetics
- Recent studies have delved into the behavioral and transcriptomic specialization of ant workers, such as "Ant nurse workers exhibit behavioral and transcriptomic specialization on larval stage" (2018).
- The role of neuropeptides in controlling social behavior and caste identity, as seen in "The neuropeptide corazonin controls social behavior and caste identity in ants" (2017), has been a significant area of focus.

### Methodologies

Linksvayer's methodologies have evolved to include a range of approaches:

#### Genetic and Genomic Analysis
- He has extensively used genomic sequencing and analysis to identify genetic signatures associated with social behavior and kin selection.

#### Behavioral and Transcriptomic Studies
- Linksvayer has employed behavioral observations and transcriptomic analyses to understand the specialization of ant workers and the role of neuropeptides in social behavior.

#### Theoretical and Empirical Modeling
- His work includes theoretical predictions and empirical modeling to understand the evolution of social insect genomes and the effects of kin selection and sex-limited expression.

### Key Findings and Breakthroughs

#### Genetic Basis of Social Behavior
- Linksvayer's research has significantly advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of social behavior in ants. For example, he has shown that genes with social effects harbor more sequence variation within and between species.

#### Role of Kin Selection
- His studies have highlighted the critical role of kin selection in the evolution of social behavior, particularly in ants with obligately sterile workers.

#### Neuropeptide Control of Caste Identity
- The discovery that the neuropeptide corazonin controls social behavior and caste identity in ants is a major breakthrough in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying social behavior.

#### Evolution of Social Complexity
- Linksvayer's work has contributed to elucidating the evolution of social complexity, including the transition from solitary to highly social life and the evolution of mutualistic relationships.

### Statistical Overview of Publication Record and Citation Metrics
