## PhD Dissertation Proposal: Applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to Study Collective Behavior in Social Insects (Ants)

### 1. **Title and Abstract**
**Title:** Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle: A Framework for Understanding Collective Behavior in Social Insects (Ants)

**Abstract:**
This PhD dissertation proposes to apply the Active Inference framework and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to study the collective behavior of social insects, specifically ants. The FEP, which posits that living systems minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity, will be used to model and understand the complex interactions and decision-making processes within ant colonies. This research aims to integrate theoretical, computational, and empirical approaches to elucidate the mechanisms underlying collective behavior, with implications for complexity science, artificial intelligence, and collective intelligence.

### 2. **Theoretical Background**
#### 2.1 **Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference**
- **Definition and Core Concepts:** Explain the FEP and Active Inference, highlighting how organisms minimize free energy through action and perception to maintain their expected phenotypic and ontogenetic states.
- **Application to Biological Systems:** Discuss the application of FEP to various biological systems, including single cells, flora, and complex organisms, emphasizing its role in self-organization and adaptive behavior.
- **Markov Blankets and Autonomous Systems:** Describe the concept of Markov blankets and their role in defining autonomous systems that minimize free energy through active inference.

#### 2.2 **Collective Behavior in Social Insects**
- **Overview of Collective Behavior:** Introduce the concept of collective behavior in social insects, focusing on ants, and discuss existing theories such as swarm intelligence and self-organization.
- **Current Understanding and Gaps:** Review current research on ant colonies, highlighting the complexities of their social structures, communication mechanisms, and decision-making processes. Identify gaps in current theories that the FEP and Active Inference could address.

### 3. **Research Questions**
- **How can the FEP and Active Inference be applied to model the collective behavior of ants?**
- **What are the key parameters and processes that need to be considered when modeling ant colonies using Active Inference?**
- **How do ants minimize free energy at the individual and collective levels?**
- **Can Active Inference models predict and explain observed behaviors in ant colonies better than existing theories?**
- **What are the implications of using FEP and Active Inference for understanding collective intelligence and decision-making in social insects?**

### 4. **Proposed Methodologies**
#### 4.1 **Empirical Methods**
- **Observational Studies:** Conduct detailed observations of ant colonies in controlled and natural environments to gather data on individual and collective behavior.
- **Experimental Manipulations:** Design experiments to manipulate environmental conditions, colony size, and communication pathways to observe how ants adapt and make decisions.
- **Neuroscience Techniques:** Use techniques such as optogenetics, electrophysiology, or neuroimaging to study the neural basis of decision-making in ants.

#### 4.2 **Computational Methods**
- **Agent-Based Modeling:** Develop agent-based models where individual ants are modeled as agents that minimize free energy through active inference. Simulate various scenarios to predict collective behavior.
- **Bayesian Inference and Learning:** Implement Bayesian inference and learning algorithms to model how ants update their beliefs and make decisions based on sensory inputs and actions.
- **Parameter Estimation and Model Validation:** Use empirical data to estimate model parameters and validate the models against observed behaviors.

### 5. **Innovative Experimental Designs**
#### 5.1 **Combining Traditional Myrmecology with Neuroscience Techniques**
- **Integrated Observational and Experimental Setup:** Design an experimental setup that combines traditional myrmecological methods (e.g., tracking individual ants, monitoring pheromone trails) with neuroscience techniques (e.g., optogenetics to manipulate neural activity).
- **Real-Time Data Collection and Analysis:** Use real-time data collection systems to monitor ant behavior and environmental conditions, and analyze the data using machine learning and statistical methods.

#### 5.2 **Testing Active Inference Models Against Alternative Theories**
- **Comparative Modeling:** Develop and compare Active Inference models with other theoretical models of collective behavior (e.g., swarm intelligence models, game theory models).
- **Experimental Validation:** Design experiments to test the predictions of Active Inference models against those of alternative theories, using both empirical and computational approaches.

### 6. **Expected Outcomes**
- **Detailed Models of Ant Collective Behavior:** Develop comprehensive models of ant collective behavior based on the FEP and Active Inference.
- **Insights into Decision-Making Processes:** Gain insights into how ants make decisions at the individual and collective levels, and how these decisions are influenced by environmental and social factors.
- **Validation of Active Inference in Biological Systems:** Validate the application of Active Inference to biological systems, specifically social insects, and demonstrate its predictive power.

### 7. **Potential Implications**
#### 7.1 **Complexity Science**
- **Understanding Self-Organization:** Contribute to the understanding of self-organization in complex biological systems.
- **Generalizability to Other Systems:** Explore the generalizability of the FEP and Active Inference to other complex systems, such as human societies or ecological networks.

#### 7.2 **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Inspiration for AI Algorithms:** Provide insights that could inspire new AI algorithms based on Active Inference and the FEP.
- **Autonomous Systems Design:** Inform the design of autonomous systems that can adapt and make decisions in complex environments.

#### 7.3 **Collective Intelligence**
- **Understanding Collective Decision-Making:** Enhance our understanding of collective decision-making processes in social insects and other collective systems.
- **Applications in Human Societies:** Explore potential applications of the findings in human societies, such as in the design of more efficient collective decision-making processes.
