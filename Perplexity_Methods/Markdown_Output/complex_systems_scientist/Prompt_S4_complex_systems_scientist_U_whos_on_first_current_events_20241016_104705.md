### Dialog:

```markdown
**Abbott:** Okay, Costello, let's talk about the latest news. We've got a big storm brewing.

**Costello:** A storm? Which one?

**Abbott:** Hurricane Milton.

**Costello:** Who's on first?

**Abbott:** No, no, Milton is the storm's name.

**Costello:** So, Milton is pitching?

**Abbott:** Not pitching, Costello. It's a hurricane.

**Costello:** But who's the pitcher?

**Abbott:** There's no pitcher here. We're talking about a hurricane.

**Costello:** I don't know, I thought we were discussing the team.

**Abbott:** No team, just Hurricane Milton. It's a Category 5.

**Costello:** Category 5? That sounds like a player's number.

**Abbott:** No, it's the storm's category. Very strong.

**Costello:** Strong? Like the shortstop?

**Abbott:** No, not the shortstop. The storm is strong.

**Costello:** So, who's on first base?

**Abbott:** There's no first base here. We're talking about a hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast.

**Costello:** The Gulf Coast? That sounds like the outfield.

**Abbott:** Not the outfield, Costello. It's a region.

**Costello:** Region? Like the league?

**Abbott:** No league, just a geographic area.

**Costello:** Okay, so who's the manager of this storm?

**Abbott:** There's no manager. It's a natural disaster.

**Costello:** Natural disaster? That sounds like the umpire.

**Abbott:** (sighs) No umpire, Costello. Just the storm.

**Costello:** Alright, so what's on second?

**Abbott:** Nothing's on second. We're not talking about baseball positions.

**Costello:** But what if the storm hits second base?

**Abbott:** (frustrated) There is no second base It's a hurricane!

**Costello:** I don't know, I'm confused. Who's on third?

**Abbott:** Nobody's on third This isn't a baseball game!

**Costello:** (exasperated) Okay, okay. So, when is the storm arriving?

**Abbott:** Tomorrow.

**Costello:** Tomorrow? That's the pitcher's name!

**Abbott:** (laughing) No, no, Costello. Tomorrow is the day the storm is expected to hit.

**Costello:** (confused) But what time tomorrow?

**Abbott:** We don't know the exact time yet.

**Costello:** (frustrated) What time what?

**Abbott:** (laughing) Never mind, Costello. Just stay tuned for updates.

**Costello:** (resigned) Alright, I'll stay tuned. But I still don't know who's on first.

**Abbott:** (laughing) There's no one on first, Costello. It's just Hurricane Milton.

- **Gulf Coast**: Abbott explains it as a geographic region, but Costello thinks it sounds like the outfield.
- **Manager of the storm**: Costello asks about the manager, confusing the natural disaster with a baseball team.
- **Umpire**: The natural disaster is likened to an umpire by Costello, adding to the confusion.

This dialog maintains the spirit of the original "Who's on First?" routine by Abbott and Costello, incorporating current events and baseball lore into a humorous and confusing conversation.
