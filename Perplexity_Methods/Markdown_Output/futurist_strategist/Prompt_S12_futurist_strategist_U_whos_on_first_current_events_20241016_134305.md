```markdown
**Bud:** Alright, Lou, let's talk about the latest news. Who's the new leader in the tech world?

**Lou:** Who?

**Bud:** No, not "who." The CEO of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg.

**Lou:** Mark Zuckerberg? That's not who I'm asking about. Who is the new leader?

**Bud:** There is no "who." Mark Zuckerberg is the one.

**Lou:** But you said "who" is the new leader.

**Bud:** No, I said Mark Zuckerberg. Now, let's move on to climate change. What's the main issue?

**Lou:** What?

**Bud:** Not "what." The issue is rising temperatures and sea levels.

**Lou:** But you said "what" is the main issue.

**Bud:** No, it's climate change. Now, who's leading the charge against it?

**Lou:** Who?

**Bud:** (sighs) Not "who." Greta Thunberg is one of the key figures.

**Lou:** Greta Thunberg? I thought you said "who" was leading the charge.

**Bud:** (frustrated) There is no "who" leading the charge Greta Thunberg is the one.

**Lou:** Okay, okay. So what's on second base in the economy?

**Bud:** There's no one on second base. We're talking about inflation rates.

**Lou:** But you said "what" was on second.

**Bud:** No, I didn't say that. Inflation is the issue.

**Lou:** So, who's pitching in the Middle East conflict?

**Bud:** (exasperated) There's no "who" pitching We're talking about diplomatic efforts by world leaders.

**Lou:** But you said "who" was pitching.

**Bud:** No, it's leaders like Biden and Netanyahu who are involved.

**Lou:** And what's the catcher's name in the AI revolution?

**Bud:** There's no catcher in AI. We're talking about ChatGPT and other AI models.

**Lou:** But you said "what" was the catcher.

**Bud:** (nearly giving up) There is no catcher It's AI technology.

**Lou:** So, who's on first in the COVID-19 vaccine debate?

**Bud:** (resigned) There is no "who" on first. The debate is about vaccine efficacy and mandates.

**Lou:** But you said "who" was on first.

**Bud:** (throwing hands up) That's it, Lou There is no "who" It's just the vaccine debate!

**Lou:** (confused) Wait, so who's on first?

**Bud:** (shaking head) Third base!
