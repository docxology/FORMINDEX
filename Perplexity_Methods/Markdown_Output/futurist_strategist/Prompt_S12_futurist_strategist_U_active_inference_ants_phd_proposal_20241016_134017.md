## PhD Dissertation Proposal: Applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to Study Collective Behavior in Social Insects (Ants)

### Executive Summary
This PhD dissertation proposal aims to explore the application of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to understand the collective behavior of social insects, specifically ants. The research will integrate theoretical, empirical, and computational approaches to elucidate how ants minimize free energy through their interactions and behaviors, and how this framework can be used to model and predict collective behavior.

### Introduction and Background
#### Theoretical Background
- **Active Inference and Free Energy Principle**: Overview of the FEP and Active Inference, highlighting how biological agents minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity and achieve goal-directed behavior.
- **Collective Behavior in Social Insects**: Review of current theories and models explaining collective behavior in ants, including self-organization, swarm intelligence, and communication mechanisms.
- **Relevance of Active Inference**: Discussion on why Active Inference is a promising framework for understanding collective behavior, given its ability to integrate perception, action, and learning under a unified principle.

#### Research Questions
- How do individual ants use Active Inference to minimize free energy in their interactions with the environment and other ants?
- Can the FEP explain the emergence of collective behaviors such as foraging, nest building, and defense in ant colonies?
- How do different environmental conditions and social contexts influence the free energy minimization strategies of ants?
- What are the implications of using Active Inference models for understanding and predicting collective behavior in ants compared to other theoretical frameworks?

### Methodologies
#### Empirical Methods
- **Observational Studies**: Detailed observations of ant colonies under various conditions to record individual and collective behaviors.
- **Experimental Manipulations**: Controlled experiments to alter environmental conditions (e.g., food availability, nest structure) and observe the resulting changes in ant behavior.
- **Neuroscience Techniques**: Use of techniques such as optogenetics, calcium imaging, or electrophysiology to study the neural basis of ant behavior and decision-making.
- **Markov Blanket Analysis**: Application of Markov blanket concepts to identify the statistical boundaries and dependencies between internal and external states of ants.

#### Computational Methods
- **Simulation Models**: Development of computational models using Active Inference and FEP to simulate ant behavior and collective outcomes.
- **Message Passing Algorithms**: Implementation of message passing algorithms in Forney-style factor graphs to automate free energy minimization and simulate interactions between ants and their environment.
- **Bayesian Model Selection**: Use of Bayesian model selection to compare the fit of Active Inference models against alternative theories of collective behavior.

### Expected Outcomes
- **Mechanistic Understanding**: A detailed mechanistic understanding of how individual ants use Active Inference to minimize free energy and how this leads to collective behaviors.
- **Predictive Models**: Development of predictive models that can simulate and forecast collective behavior in ants under various conditions.
- **Comparison with Alternative Theories**: A comprehensive comparison of the explanatory power of Active Inference models versus other theories of collective behavior.
- **Implications for Complexity Science**: Insights into how the FEP can be applied to other complex adaptive systems beyond social insects.

### Implications and Contributions
#### Complexity Science
- **Generalizability**: Exploration of how the FEP and Active Inference can be generalized to other complex systems, such as human societies or ecological networks.
- **Self-Organization**: Understanding how self-organization emerges in complex systems through the lens of free energy minimization.

#### Artificial Intelligence
- **Autonomous Systems**: Development of autonomous systems that can learn and adapt using Active Inference principles.
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Application of Active Inference to swarm robotics and other collective AI systems.

#### Collective Intelligence
- **Decision-Making**: Insights into how collective decision-making processes can be optimized using Active Inference models.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Understanding the role of social networks in facilitating free energy minimization in collective behavior.

### Innovative Experimental Designs
- **Combining Myrmecology with Neuroscience**: Integrating traditional myrmecological methods with cutting-edge neuroscience techniques to study the neural basis of ant behavior.
- **Environmental Manipulations**: Designing experiments that manipulate environmental factors to observe how ants adapt their behavior to minimize free energy.
- **Multi-Agent Simulations**: Conducting simulations with multiple agents to study the emergence of collective behavior under different conditions.

### Testing Active Inference Models
- **Model Comparison**: Using Bayesian model selection to compare the fit of Active Inference models against other theories such as self-organization, game theory, or kin selection.
- **Predictive Validation**: Validating the predictive power of Active Inference models by comparing simulated outcomes with empirical data.
