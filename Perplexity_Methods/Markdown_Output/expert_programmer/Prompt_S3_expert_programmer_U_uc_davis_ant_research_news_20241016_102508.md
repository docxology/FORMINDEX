## Recent Ant-Related Research Projects, Publications, and News from UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology

### Significant Findings and Publications

#### Discovery of a New Genus of Primordial Ants
- A significant study published in the journal *Insects* involved the discovery of a new genus and species of primordial ants, †*Desyopone hereon* gen. et sp. nov., using advanced 3D-imaging technology such as synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-µ-CT). This research, led by Brendon Boudinot, a former UC Davis doctoral student, has implications for ant classification and phylogeny, particularly in the subfamily Ponerinae.

#### Phylogenomic and Morphological Studies
- Philip S. Ward, a professor of entomology at UC Davis, has been instrumental in integrating morphological and molecular methods in ant systematics. His work involves using phylogenomic approaches to study thousands of genes, providing more detailed and resolved phylogenies. Ward emphasizes the importance of both morphological and molecular data in delimiting species and understanding phylogenetic relationships.

#### Evolutionary Relationships and Anatomy
- Ziv Lieberman, a doctoral student in the Ward lab, focuses on connecting evolutionary relationships with anatomy using next-generation imaging techniques and large-scale genetic analyses. His research highlights the importance of internal anatomical features in understanding ant biodiversity and evolution.

#### Biogeography and Species Discovery
- Jill Oberski, another doctoral student in the Ward lab, is studying the ant genus *Dorymyrmex*, exploring biogeography, species discovery, and the ancient history of these ants. Her work aims to clarify the number of species within this genus and their dispersal patterns across the Americas.

### Ongoing Studies and Collaborations

#### Leptanillinae Ants
- Zach Griebenow, a doctoral student in the Ward lab, is researching the evolutionary relationships among leptanilline ants, a group known for their bizarre structural modifications. His work involves teasing out major evolutionary relationships and understanding the unique traits of these ants.

#### Ant-Plant Mutualisms and Ecological Studies
- Professor Phil Ward's research interests also include ant-plant mutualisms and the ecological and evolutionary aspects of ant behavior. His lab collaborates with other researchers to study various aspects of ant ecology and behavior, contributing to a broader understanding of ant biology.

### Notable Achievements, Grants, and Recognition

#### Awards and Fellowships
- Brendon Boudinot, who received his doctorate from UC Davis in 2020, was awarded a Peter S. Buck Research Fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution and is also an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellow. He received the John Henry Comstock Award from the Pacific Branch, Entomological Society of America.

#### Grants and Funding
- The Ward lab has received grants to study various ant taxa, including a recent grant to investigate the phylogeny of the tribe Camponotini. These grants support ongoing research in ant systematics and phylogenetics.

### Implications for Local and Global Ant Biology and Ecology

#### Advanced Imaging Techniques
- The use of advanced imaging techniques like SR-µ-CT is transforming the field of ant paleontology and morphology, enabling detailed 3D models and quantitative analysis. This approach will increasingly integrate phenomic and genomic data, enhancing our understanding of ant evolution and diversity.

#### Global Insights into Ancient Ecosystems
- The discovery of fossil ants in African amber provides unique insights into ancient forest ecosystems. This research highlights the scientific significance of amber deposits and their potential to reveal evolutionary histories of insects on different continents.

#### Contributions to Systematics and Phylogeny
- The integration of morphological and molecular methods in the Ward lab and other UC Davis research groups is significantly advancing our understanding of ant systematics and phylogeny. This work has implications for species-level taxonomy, biogeography, and the broader evolutionary questions in myrmecology.

### Conclusion

The research conducted by the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology has made substantial contributions to the field of myrmecology, particularly in ant systematics, phylogeny, and ecology. The use of advanced imaging techniques, the integration of morphological and molecular methods, and the focus on biogeography and species discovery are all key areas that have advanced our understanding of ants globally.
