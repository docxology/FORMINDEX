## PhD Dissertation Proposal: Applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to Study Collective Behavior in Social Insects, with a Focus on Ants

### 1. **Title and Abstract**
- **Title:** "Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle: A Framework for Understanding Collective Behavior in Social Insects"
- **Abstract:**
  This PhD dissertation proposes to apply the Active Inference (AI) framework and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to study the collective behavior of social insects, specifically ants. The research aims to explore how these theoretical frameworks can explain the complex interactions and decision-making processes within ant colonies. By integrating empirical and computational methodologies, this study will investigate the role of active inference in maintaining colony integrity, optimizing resource allocation, and adapting to environmental changes. The findings will have significant implications for complexity science, artificial intelligence, and collective intelligence.

### 2. **Theoretical Background**
#### 2.1 **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**
  - Overview of the FEP and its application to biological systems.
  - Explanation of variational free energy, expected free energy, and their roles in minimizing surprise and optimizing Bayesian model evidence.
  - Discussion on the concept of Markov blankets and their significance in statistical separation between internal and external states.

#### 2.2 **Active Inference (AI)**
  - Definition and principles of active inference as a corollary of the FEP.
  - How AI models action selection as the minimization of free energy to fulfill prior beliefs about preferred future observations.
  - The role of active inference in perception, action, and decision-making processes.

#### 2.3 **Collective Behavior in Social Insects**
  - Overview of collective behavior in ants, including communication, cooperation, and self-organization.
  - Review of existing theories and models of collective behavior in social insects.

### 3. **Research Questions**
- How do individual ants use active inference to maintain and adapt their internal states and actions within the colony?
- What role does the minimization of free energy play in the collective decision-making processes of ant colonies?
- How do environmental changes affect the active inference processes in ants and the overall colony behavior?
- Can the AI framework predict and explain the emergence of complex behaviors in ant colonies?

### 4. **Proposed Methodologies**
#### 4.1 **Empirical Methods**
  - **Observational Studies:**
    - Long-term observations of ant colonies in controlled and natural environments.
    - Use of tracking systems to monitor individual ant movements and interactions.
  - **Experimental Manipulations:**
    - Manipulating environmental conditions (e.g., food availability, nest structure) to observe adaptive responses.
    - Introducing artificial stimuli to test the ants' ability to minimize surprise and maintain preferred states.
  - **Neuroscience Techniques:**
    - Using optogenetics or other neurostimulation methods to study neural activity in ants during different tasks.
    - Analyzing pheromone trails and chemical communication to understand information exchange.

#### 4.2 **Computational Methods**
  - **Active Inference Modeling:**
    - Developing and simulating AI models using probabilistic programming techniques (e.g., ForneyLab) to predict ant behavior.
    - Implementing message-passing algorithms for free energy minimization in hierarchical and interdependent models.
  - **Agent-Based Modeling:**
    - Creating agent-based models to simulate ant colonies and test the predictions of AI models.
    - Integrating empirical data into computational models to validate and refine the AI framework.

### 5. **Innovative Experimental Designs**
- **Combining Traditional Myrmecology with Neuroscience:**
  - Using micro-electrode arrays to record neural activity while ants perform tasks, and correlating this with behavioral data.
  - Designing experiments where ants are presented with complex decision-making scenarios (e.g., multiple food sources, obstacles) to observe how they optimize their actions.
- **Virtual Reality for Ants:**
  - Creating virtual environments to simulate various ecological scenarios and test the ants' adaptive responses.
  - Using augmented reality to manipulate pheromone trails and observe how ants adjust their behavior.

### 6. **Testing Active Inference Models Against Alternative Theories**
- **Comparison with Other Collective Behavior Models:**
  - Testing AI models against traditional models of collective behavior (e.g., reaction-diffusion models, swarm intelligence models).
  - Evaluating the predictive power and explanatory capacity of AI models compared to alternative theories.
- **Experimental Validation:**
  - Designing experiments to specifically test the predictions of AI models, such as the role of precision-weighted prediction errors in guiding ant behavior.

### 7. **Expected Outcomes**
- **Insights into Collective Behavior:**
  - A deeper understanding of how individual ants use active inference to contribute to collective behavior.
  - Quantitative models that predict and explain the emergence of complex behaviors in ant colonies.
- **Advancements in AI and FEP:**
  - Contributions to the development of AI and FEP by applying these frameworks to a new domain (social insects).
  - Potential extensions of the AI framework to other biological and artificial systems.

### 8. **Potential Implications**
#### 8.1 **Complexity Science**
  - Understanding how complex systems self-organize and maintain integrity through active inference.
  - Insights into the general principles governing collective behavior in various biological and artificial systems.

#### 8.2 **Artificial Intelligence**
  - Development of more robust and adaptive AI systems inspired by biological active inference processes.
  - Applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making algorithms.

#### 8.3 **Collective Intelligence**
  - Understanding how collective intelligence emerges from individual behaviors guided by active inference.
  - Implications for human collective behavior, social networks, and organizational dynamics.
