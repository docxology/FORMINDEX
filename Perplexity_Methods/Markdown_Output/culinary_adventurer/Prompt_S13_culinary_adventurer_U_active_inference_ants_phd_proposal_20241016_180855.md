## PhD Dissertation Proposal: Applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to Study Collective Behavior in Social Insects, with a Focus on Ants

### 1. **Title and Abstract**
**Title:** "Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle in Collective Behavior of Social Insects: A Study on Ants"
**Abstract:**
This dissertation proposes to apply the Active Inference framework and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to understand the collective behavior of social insects, specifically focusing on ants. The research aims to explore how ants minimize free energy through their actions and perceptions, and how this framework can explain their complex social behaviors. The study will combine traditional myrmecological methods with cutting-edge neuroscience techniques to test Active Inference models against alternative theories of collective behavior.

### 2. **Theoretical Background**
#### 2.1 **Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle**
- **Definition and Core Concepts:** Explain the Active Inference framework and the Free Energy Principle, highlighting key concepts such as variational free energy, expected free energy, and the role of action and perception in minimizing surprise.
- **Application in Biological Systems:** Discuss how FEP has been applied to various biological systems, from single cells to complex organisms, and its implications for understanding adaptive behavior.
- **Collective Behavior and Social Insects:** Review existing theories on collective behavior in social insects, including self-organization, swarm intelligence, and communication mechanisms.

#### 2.2 **Relevant Theories and Models**
- **Alternative Theories:** Discuss alternative theories of collective behavior, such as kin selection, group selection, and game theory, to provide a comparative framework for evaluating Active Inference models.
- **Mathematical and Computational Models:** Introduce the mathematical and computational models used in Active Inference, including Bayesian inference and Markov blankets.

### 3. **Research Questions**
- **Primary Questions:**
  - How do ants use active inference to minimize free energy in their collective behaviors?
  - Can the FEP explain the emergence of complex social behaviors in ant colonies?
  - How do ants balance extrinsic and epistemic value in their decision-making processes?
- **Secondary Questions:**
  - What are the key sensory and motor components involved in ants' active inference processes?
  - How do environmental factors influence the free energy minimization strategies of ants?

### 4. **Proposed Methodologies**
#### 4.1 **Empirical Methods**
- **Field and Laboratory Observations:** Conduct detailed observations of ant colonies in both natural and controlled laboratory settings to gather data on their behavior, communication, and decision-making processes.
- **Experimental Manipulations:** Design experiments to manipulate environmental conditions (e.g., food availability, predator presence) and observe how ants adjust their behaviors to minimize free energy.
- **Neuroscience Techniques:** Use techniques such as optogenetics, electrophysiology, and neuroimaging to study the neural basis of active inference in ants.

#### 4.2 **Computational Methods**
- **Simulation Models:** Develop computational models based on Active Inference to simulate ant behavior and predict outcomes under various conditions.
- **Machine Learning:** Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of ant behavior and identify patterns that align with FEP predictions.
- **Bayesian Inference:** Implement Bayesian inference models to estimate the parameters of the Active Inference framework in ant colonies.

### 5. **Expected Outcomes**
- **Validation of Active Inference Models:** Expect to validate the applicability of Active Inference models in explaining the collective behavior of ants.
- **Insights into Decision-Making:** Gain insights into how ants make decisions that minimize free energy and balance extrinsic and epistemic values.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare the explanatory power of Active Inference models with alternative theories of collective behavior.

### 6. **Potential Implications**
#### 6.1 **Complexity Science**
- **Understanding Complex Systems:** Contribute to the understanding of complex systems and how they self-organize and adapt.
- **Generalizability:** Explore the generalizability of the FEP to other complex biological and social systems.

#### 6.2 **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Inspiration for AI Algorithms:** Provide insights that could inspire new AI algorithms based on active inference and free energy minimization.
- **Autonomous Systems:** Inform the development of autonomous systems that can adapt and learn in complex environments.

#### 6.3 **Collective Intelligence**
- **Collective Decision-Making:** Shed light on collective decision-making processes in social insects and their implications for human collective intelligence.
- **Swarm Intelligence:** Contribute to the field of swarm intelligence by understanding how individual behaviors lead to emergent collective behaviors.

### 7. **Innovative Experimental Designs**
- **Combining Traditional and Modern Techniques:** Integrate traditional myrmecological methods (e.g., marking individuals, tracking behavior) with modern neuroscience techniques (e.g., optogenetics, neuroimaging).
- **Controlled Environments:** Design controlled laboratory environments that mimic natural conditions to study ant behavior under various stimuli.
- **Real-Time Data Collection:** Use real-time data collection methods to capture detailed behavioral data and neural activity.

### 8. **Testing Active Inference Models**
- **Comparative Studies:** Conduct comparative studies between Active Inference models and alternative theories (e.g., kin selection, game theory) to evaluate their explanatory power.
- **Predictive Validity:** Test the predictive validity of Active Inference models by simulating and then observing ant behavior under different conditions.
