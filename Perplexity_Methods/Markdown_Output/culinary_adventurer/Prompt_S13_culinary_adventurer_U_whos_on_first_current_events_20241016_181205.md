**Bud:** Alright, Lou, let's talk about the team. We've got "Vaccine" on first base.

**Lou:** Vaccine? Why is he on first base?

**Bud:** Because he's vaccinated.

**Lou:** But I thought everyone on the team was vaccinated.

**Bud:** They are, but Vaccine is the first baseman.

**Lou:** So, what's his real name?

**Bud:** His name is Vaccine. Now, "Musk" is on second base.

**Lou:** Musk? Like Elon Musk?

**Bud:** No, just Musk. He's our second baseman.

**Lou:** But what about Elon Musk? Is he on the team?

**Bud:** No, Elon Musk is not on the team. Musk is on second.

**Lou:** Okay, got it. So, who's on third?

**Bud:** "AI" is on third.

**Lou:** AI? Like artificial intelligence?

**Bud:** Yes, AI. He's our third baseman.

**Lou:** But how can AI play baseball?

**Bud:** It's just his name, Lou. Now, "Hurricane" is pitching.

**Lou:** Hurricane? Which one? There are so many hurricanes this year.

**Bud:** Just Hurricane. He's our pitcher.

**Lou:** But which hurricane? Is it Hurricane Milton?

**Bud:** No, just Hurricane. He's been pitching well this season.

**Lou:** Okay, so Vaccine is on first, Musk is on second, AI is on third, and Hurricane is pitching. What about the catcher?

**Bud:** The catcher is "Meta".

**Lou:** Meta? Like Meta from Facebook?

**Bud:** No, just Meta. He's our catcher.

**Lou:** But what about Mark Zuckerberg? Is he on the team?

**Bud:** No, Mark Zuckerberg is not on the team. Meta is the catcher.

**Lou:** Alright, so Vaccine is on first, Musk is on second, AI is on third, Hurricane is pitching, and Meta is catching. Who's the manager?

**Bud:** The manager is "Putin".

**Lou:** Putin? Like Vladimir Putin?

**Bud:** No, just Putin. He's our manager.

**Lou:** But isn't Vladimir Putin busy with other things?

**Bud:** This is just Putin, our manager.

**Lou:** Okay, so Putin is the manager. What about the umpire?

**Bud:** The umpire is "Google".

**Lou:** Google? Like the search engine?

**Bud:** Yes, Google. He's our umpire.

**Lou:** But how can Google be an umpire?

**Bud:** It's just his name, Lou. Now, let's get back to the game.

**Lou:** Wait a minute. If Vaccine is on first, Musk is on second, AI is on third, Hurricane is pitching, Meta is catching, Putin is the manager, and Google is the umpire... how do I know who's who?

**Bud:** It's simple, Lou. Just remember: Vaccine is vaccinated, Musk is on second, AI is on third, Hurricane is pitching, Meta is catching, Putin is managing, and Google is umpiring.

**Lou:** (frustrated) I don't even know what I'm saying anymore Look, I'm not confused about the players...

**Bud:** (calmly) Okay, Lou.

**Lou:** (exasperated) And the guy you let in IS confused!

**Bud:** (smiling) That's right.

**Lou:** (throwing up his hands) So why can't I understand who's on first again?

**Bud:** (laughing) Because it's just who's on first, Lou!

**(Both laugh as the scene ends.)**
