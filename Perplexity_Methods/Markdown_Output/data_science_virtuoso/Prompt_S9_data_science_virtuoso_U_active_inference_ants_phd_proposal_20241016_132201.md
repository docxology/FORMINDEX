## PhD Dissertation Proposal: Applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to Study Collective Behavior in Social Insects (Ants)

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Background and Motivation
- Introduce the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) as a theoretical framework for understanding biological and cognitive processes.
- Explain the significance of studying collective behavior in social insects, particularly ants, and the potential insights into complexity science, artificial intelligence, and collective intelligence.
- Motivate the need for integrating FEP and AI with traditional myrmecological methods and cutting-edge neuroscience techniques.

#### 1.2 Research Objectives
- To apply the FEP and AI to model and explain the collective behavior of ants.
- To design and implement innovative experimental and computational methodologies to test these models.
- To evaluate the efficacy of FEP and AI against alternative theories of collective behavior.

### 2. Theoretical Background
#### 2.1 The Free Energy Principle
- Define the FEP and its core concepts: free energy, variational free energy, and expected free energy.
- Explain how the FEP frames biological systems as minimizing free energy to maintain their integrity and reduce surprise.
- Discuss the role of Markov blankets and active inference in separating internal and external states and in maintaining system autonomy.

#### 2.2 Active Inference
- Describe active inference as the process of selecting actions to minimize free energy over time.
- Explain how active inference integrates perception, action, and learning within a Bayesian inference framework.
- Discuss the distinction between mere and adaptive active inference and their implications for modeling sensorimotor autonomy.

#### 2.3 Collective Behavior in Social Insects
- Overview of collective behavior in ants, including foraging, nest construction, and social communication.
- Review existing theories and models of collective behavior, such as swarm intelligence and self-organization.

### 3. Research Questions
- How can the FEP and AI be applied to model the collective behavior of ants?
- What are the key parameters and processes that influence the minimization of free energy in ant colonies?
- How do ants use active inference to adapt to changing environmental conditions?
- How does the FEP and AI framework compare to other theories of collective behavior in explaining ant behavior?

### 4. Proposed Methodologies
#### 4.1 Empirical Methods
- **Observational Studies**: Use camera traps and tracking systems to observe and record ant behavior in natural and controlled environments.
- **Experimental Manipulations**: Design experiments to alter environmental conditions (e.g., food availability, nest structure) and observe the adaptive responses of ant colonies.
- **Neuroscience Techniques**: Employ techniques such as optogenetics, electrophysiology, or neuroimaging to study the neural basis of ant behavior and decision-making.

#### 4.2 Computational Methods
- **Model Development**: Develop computational models based on the FEP and AI to simulate ant behavior and collective decision-making.
- **Simulation Studies**: Use simulations to test hypotheses about the parameters and processes influencing free energy minimization in ant colonies.
- **Model Validation**: Validate computational models against empirical data to ensure their accuracy and predictive power.

### 5. Expected Outcomes
- **Theoretical Contributions**: Advance the understanding of collective behavior in ants through the lens of the FEP and AI.
- **Empirical Insights**: Provide new empirical data on how ants adapt and make decisions collectively.
- **Computational Tools**: Develop and validate computational models that can predict and explain ant behavior under various conditions.
- **Interdisciplinary Implications**: Offer insights into complexity science, artificial intelligence, and collective intelligence by demonstrating how biological systems can be modeled using Bayesian inference and free energy minimization.

### 6. Potential Implications
#### 6.1 Complexity Science
- Shed light on how complex systems can self-organize and maintain stability through active inference.
- Provide a framework for understanding the emergence of collective behavior in complex biological systems.

#### 6.2 Artificial Intelligence
- Offer a novel approach to designing autonomous agents that can adapt and learn in dynamic environments.
- Demonstrate how AI systems can be engineered to mimic the sensorimotor autonomy observed in biological systems.

#### 6.3 Collective Intelligence
- Enhance our understanding of how collective intelligence arises from individual behaviors and interactions.
- Provide tools for predicting and managing collective behavior in various contexts, including human societies and artificial systems.

### 7. Innovative Experimental Designs
- **Combining Traditional Myrmecology with Neuroscience**:
  - Use optogenetics to manipulate neural activity in ants while observing their behavior.
  - Employ electrophysiology to record neural signals during collective tasks.
- **Environmental Manipulations**:
  - Create controlled environments with varying levels of complexity to study adaptive responses.
  - Use virtual reality or augmented reality to simulate different ecological scenarios.

### 8. Testing Active Inference Models Against Alternative Theories
- **Comparison with Swarm Intelligence Models**:
  - Evaluate how FEP and AI models predict ant behavior compared to traditional swarm intelligence models.
- **Comparison with Self-Organization Models**:
  - Test whether FEP and AI models better explain the emergence of collective patterns in ant colonies than self-organization models.
- **Experimental Validation**:
  - Design experiments to test specific predictions made by FEP and AI models against those made by alternative theories.

### 9. Conclusion
Summarize the key aspects of the proposal and highlight the potential contributions to the fields of complexity science, artificial intelligence, and collective intelligence.
