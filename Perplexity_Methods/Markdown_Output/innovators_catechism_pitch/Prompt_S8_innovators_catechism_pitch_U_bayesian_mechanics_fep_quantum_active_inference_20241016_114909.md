## Situation

### Key Problems:
- **Modelling Complex Systems**: Traditional mechanics often struggle to model systems that exhibit complex, adaptive, and self-organizing behaviors.
- **Integrating Probabilistic Beliefs**: There is a need for a framework that can incorporate probabilistic beliefs and sensory states into the dynamics of physical systems.
- **Interdisciplinary Gaps**: Current theories lack a unified approach that bridges physics, information theory, and cognition effectively.

### User Segments:
- **Physicists**: Researchers in statistical mechanics and complex systems.
- **Neuroscientists**: Scientists studying brain function and cognition.
- **Artificial Intelligence Researchers**: Developers of AI systems that need to model and adapt to complex environments.
- **Quantum Computing Experts**: Researchers exploring the intersection of quantum mechanics and information theory.

### Alternatives:
- **Traditional Mechanics**: Classical and quantum mechanics, which do not inherently incorporate probabilistic beliefs.
- **Statistical Mechanics**: While it deals with probabilistic distributions, it does not directly address the encoding of beliefs about external states.
- **Current AI Models**: Many AI models lack a formal, mathematically principled approach to integrating sensory data and probabilistic beliefs.

### Early Adopters:
- **Researchers in Complex Systems**: Those actively seeking new frameworks to model self-organizing systems.
- **Neuroscience and AI Communities**: Scientists and engineers looking for more sophisticated models of cognition and adaptive behavior.
- **Quantum Computing Researchers**: Experts interested in integrating probabilistic mechanics with quantum principles.

## Mission

### Value Proposition:
To develop and apply Bayesian mechanics, the free energy principle, and quantum active inference as a unified framework for modeling complex, adaptive systems. This framework aims to provide a mathematically principled explanation for how systems encode and adapt to their environment, integrating probabilistic beliefs and sensory data.

## Potential Avenues of Approach

### Approach:
1. **Bayesian Mechanics**:
   - Develop tools to model systems that encode probabilistic beliefs about their environment. This involves using conjugate information geometry to describe the dynamics of beliefs and physical states.
   - Apply Bayesian mechanics to various systems, such as path-tracking, mode-tracking, and mode-matching, to understand how they estimate posterior probability distributions over the causes of their sensory states.

2. **Free Energy Principle**:
   - Investigate the free energy principle as a foundational concept that underlies Bayesian mechanics. This principle posits that living systems act to minimize their free energy, which is a measure of the difference between the expected and actual sensory states.
   - Examine the duality between the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy principle, highlighting their implications for system dynamics.

3. **Quantum Active Inference**:
   - Explore the integration of Bayesian mechanics with quantum principles to develop quantum active inference. This involves applying quantum information theory to active inference models, enabling the modeling of quantum systems that adapt to their environment.
