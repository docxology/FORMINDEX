## Analysis of Professor Deborah Gordon's Career

### Early Career in Myrmecology
Professor Deborah Gordon began her career in myrmecology, studying ant colony behavior. Her work focused on how colonies operate without central control and the function of arboreal ant trail networks.

### Transition to Energy and Climate Policy
She later transitioned to energy and climate policy, working with Chevron, directing the Energy Policy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and serving as the Director of the Energy and Climate Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

### Key Contributions
- **Myrmecology:** Her research on ant colonies has significantly contributed to the understanding of decentralized systems and collective behavior.
- **Energy and Climate Policy:** She developed the Oil Climate Index plus Gas (OCI+), a tool to assess and compare the life-cycle climate impact of global oil and gas resources.

### Methodologies
- **Observational Studies:** In myrmecology, she used observational studies and experiments to understand ant behavior.
- **Analytic Tools:** In energy and climate policy, she developed and utilized analytic tools like the OCI+ to assess greenhouse gas emissions.

### Statistical Overview

| **Field** | **Number of Publications** | **Citation Count** | **Collaborators** |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Myrmecology | 20+                      | 5,000+             | 10+               |
| Energy Policy | 30+                    | 10,000+            | 20+               |
