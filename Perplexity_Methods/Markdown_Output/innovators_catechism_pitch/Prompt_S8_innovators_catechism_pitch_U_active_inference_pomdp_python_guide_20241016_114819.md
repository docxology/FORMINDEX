## Situation

### Key Problems:
- **Complexity in Modeling Cognitive Processes**: Traditional models of cognition and behavior often lack a unified framework that integrates action, perception, and learning.
- **Limited Accessibility of Active Inference Tools**: Most existing tools for active inference are either proprietary or not user-friendly, particularly for those without extensive MATLAB experience.
- **Need for Flexible and Modular Implementation**: Researchers and practitioners need a flexible and modular framework to design and simulate active inference models tailored to various tasks.

### User Segments:
- **Researchers in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience**: Those studying human or animal behavior and cognition.
- **AI and Machine Learning Practitioners**: Developers interested in advanced decision-making models.
- **Students and Educators**: Individuals teaching or learning about active inference and Bayesian inference.

### Alternatives:
- **DEM Toolbox of SPM (MATLAB)**: While widely used, it is not open-source and requires MATLAB expertise.
- **Other Proprietary Tools**: Limited by their closed nature and lack of flexibility.
- **Basic Reinforcement Learning Models**: Do not integrate perception, action, and learning under a unified Bayesian framework.

### Early Adopters:
- **Academic Researchers**: Actively seeking new methods to model complex behaviors.
- **AI Researchers**: Looking to integrate advanced decision-making frameworks into their projects.
- **Innovative Educators**: Interested in teaching cutting-edge methods in cognitive science and AI.

## Mission

### Value Proposition:
To provide a comprehensive, user-friendly, and modular Python package for simulating active inference agents using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), enabling users to design and simulate bespoke active inference models with ease.

## Potential Avenues of Approach

### Approach:
1. **Generative Model Definition**:
   - Define the POMDP generative model using `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` matrices.
   - `A`: Transition probabilities
   - `B`: Observation probabilities
   - `C`: Preference distribution (reward)
   - `D`: Prior distribution over initial states.

2. **Variational Free Energy Calculation**:
   - Calculate the expected free energy (EFE) as a cost function for decision-making.
   - EFE includes terms for risk, ambiguity, and epistemic value.

3. **Belief Updating**:
   - Perform Bayesian inference to update the agent's beliefs about the hidden states.
   - Use the `infer_states` function to compute the posterior distribution over states given observations.

4. **Policy Selection**:
   - Compute the action posterior using the softmax function over the negative expected free energy.
   - Sample actions from this posterior distribution.

### Resources:
- **Python Package (`pymdp`)**: Utilize the `pymdp` library for simulating active inference agents.
- **Computational Resources**: Access to computational environments like Google Colab or local Python setups.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing Active Inference POMDP Models

### Step 1: Define the Generative Model

```python
import numpy as np

# Define transition probabilities (A)
A = np.array([
    [0.7, 0.3],
    [0.4, 0.6]
])

# Define observation probabilities (B)
B = np.array([
    [0.9, 0.1],
    [0.2, 0.8]
])

# Define preference distribution (C)
C = np.array([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1]
])

# Define prior distribution over initial states (D)
D = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
```

### Step 2: Calculate Variational Free Energy

```python
def calculate_G(A, B, C, qs_current, actions):
    # Calculate expected free energy for each action
    G = np.zeros(len(actions))
    for a in actions:
        # Compute risk and ambiguity terms
        risk = np.sum(qs_current * np.log(qs_current / (B[:, a] * qs_current)))
        ambiguity = np.sum(qs_current * np.log(qs_current / (B[:, a] * qs_current)))
        # Compute epistemic value term
        epistemic_value = np.sum(qs_current * np.log(qs_current / (B[:, a] * qs_current)))
        # Combine terms to get expected free energy
        G[a] = risk + ambiguity + epistemic_value
    return G
```

### Step 3: Update Beliefs

```python
def infer_states(obs_idx, A, prior):
    # Perform Bayesian inference to update beliefs
    qs_current = prior.copy()
    qs_current[obs_idx] = 1  # Update belief based on observation
    return qs_current

def run_active_inference_loop(A, B, C, D, actions, env, T=5):
    prior = D.copy()  # Initial prior
    obs = env.reset()  # Initial observation
    for t in range(T):
        print(f'Time {t}: Agent observes itself in location: {obs}')
        obs_idx = env.grid_locations.index(obs)
        qs_current = infer_states(obs_idx, A, prior)
        G = calculate_G(A, B, C, qs_current, actions)
        Q_u = np.exp(-G) / np.sum(np.exp(-G))  # Action posterior
        chosen_action = np.random.choice(actions, p=Q_u)
        prior = B[:, chosen_action].dot(qs_current)  # Update prior for next timestep
        obs = env.step(chosen_action)
    return qs_current
```

### Step 4: Select Policies

```python
from pymdp.control import construct_policies

def active_inference_with_planning(A, B, C, D, n_actions, env, policy_len=2, T=5):
    prior = D  # Initial prior
    obs = env.reset()  # Initial observation
    policies = construct_policies([n_states], [n_actions], policy_len=policy_len)
    for t in range(T):
        print(f'Time {t}: Agent observes itself in location: {obs}')
        obs_idx = env.grid_locations.index(obs)
        qs_current = infer_states(obs_idx, A, prior)
        G = calculate_G(A, B, C, qs_current, actions)
        Q_u = np.exp(-G) / np.sum(np.exp(-G))  # Action posterior
        chosen_action = np.random.choice(actions, p=Q_u)
        prior = B[:, chosen_action].dot(qs_current)  # Update prior for next timestep
        obs = env.step(chosen_action)
    return qs_current
```

## Example Scenario: Foraging Task

### Environment Setup

```python
class ForagingEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, grid_size):
        self.grid_size = grid_size
        self.grid_locations = [(i, j) for i in range(grid_size) for j in range(grid_size)]
        self.current_location = (0, 0)

    def reset(self):
        self.current_location = (0, 0)
        return self.current_location

    def step(self, action):
        # Update location based on action (e.g., move up, down, left, right)
        if action == 'up' and self.current_location > 0:
            self.current_location = (self.current_location, self.current_location - 1)
        elif action == 'down' and self.current_location < self.grid_size - 1:
            self.current_location = (self.current_location, self.current_location + 1)
        elif action == 'left' and self.current_location > 0:
            self.current_location = (self.current_location - 1, self.current_location)
        elif action == 'right' and self.current_location < self.grid_size - 1:
            self.current_location = (self.current_location + 1, self.current_location)
        return self.current_location

env = ForagingEnvironment(5)
```

### Running the Active Inference Loop

```python
actions = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']
qs = run_active_inference_loop(A, B, C, D, actions, env, T=5)
```

## Potential Challenges and Optimization Strategies
