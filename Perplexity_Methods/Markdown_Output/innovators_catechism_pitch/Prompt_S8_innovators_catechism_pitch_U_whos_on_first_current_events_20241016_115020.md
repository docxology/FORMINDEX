## Dialogue: "Who's on First? - The Vaccine Umpire"

**Setting:** A baseball field, with two characters, Bud (the manager) and Lou (the confused player), standing near the dugout.

**Bud:** Alright, Lou, you gotta understand the lineup for the COVID-19 game.

**Lou:** Okay, who's on first?

**Bud:** Vaccinated.

**Lou:** The first baseman's name is Vaccinated?

**Bud:** Yes, that's right.

**Lou:** So, Vaccinated is on first. What's on second?

**Bud:** Masked.

**Lou:** Masked? You mean the guy wearing a mask?

**Bud:** No, Masked is the second baseman.

**Lou:** And I Don't Know is on third?

**Bud:** That's right. I Don't Know is on third.

**Lou:** Wait a minute. So, Vaccinated is on first, Masked is on second, and I Don't Know is on third. But what about Unvaccinated?

**Bud:** Unvaccinated is not playing today.

**Lou:** Why not?

**Bud:** Because he's not vaccinated.

**Lou:** But Vaccinated is playing. And Masked is playing too.

**Bud:** Yes, they are.

**Lou:** So, why can't Unvaccinated play if Vaccinated and Masked can?

**Bud:** Because Unvaccinated can still spread the virus.

**Lou:** But Masked is wearing a mask. That should prevent the spread.

**Bud:** Masks help, but they're not foolproof.

**Lou:** So, masks don't work?

**Bud:** Masks work, but they're not a guarantee.

**Lou:** This is confusing. So, Vaccinated can play, Masked can play, but Unvaccinated can't?

**Bud:** That's right.

**Lou:** And I Don't Know is on third. Does he know he's on third?

**Bud:** No, that's why he's called I Don't Know.

**Lou:** Okay, so let's recap. Vaccinated is on first, Masked is on second, I Don't Know is on third, and Unvaccinated is not playing.

**Bud:** That's correct.

**Lou:** But what if Unvaccinated wears a mask?

**Bud:** It doesn't matter. Unvaccinated still can't play.

**Lou:** So, the mask doesn't help Unvaccinated?

**Bud:** The mask helps, but it's not enough.

**Lou:** This is like trying to catch a fly ball with one hand tied behind my back!

**Bud:** Just remember, Vaccinated is on first, Masked is on second, and I Don't Know is on third.

**Lou:** And Unvaccinated is...?

**Bud:** Unvaccinated is not playing. Now, let's get back to the game.

**Lou:** (frustrated) Third base!

- **Masks:** The dialogue plays on the effectiveness and limitations of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
- **Third Base:** The repeated mention of "third base" is a nod to the original routine's confusion and frustration, here applied to the complexities of COVID-19 policies.
