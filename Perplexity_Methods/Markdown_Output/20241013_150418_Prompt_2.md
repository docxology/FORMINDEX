To design a detailed ant colony simulation model that incorporates recent findings on ant decision-making processes and social dynamics, we need to consider several key aspects of ant behavior, including foraging, trail formation, labor division, and response to environmental stimuli.

### Model Components

1. **Ant Agents**: Each ant will have its own state and behavior rules.
2. **Environment**: This includes the nest, food sources, and the pheromone trails.
3. **Pheromone Trails**: Ants deposit pheromones as they move, which other ants can follow.
4. **Labor Division**: Ants will engage in different tasks based on response thresholds and environmental stimuli.
5. **Decision-Making**: Ants make decisions based on pheromone concentrations, distance to food, and other environmental factors.

### Pseudocode

Here is a simplified pseudocode to outline the main components of the simulation:

```plaintext
# Initialize Environment
- Create a grid representing the environment
- Place the nest and food sources at specific locations
- Initialize pheromone trails to zero

# Initialize Ants
- Create a list of ant agents
- Each ant has attributes: position, state (foraging, returning, idle), task (based on labor division)

# Main Simulation Loop
while simulation_running:
    for each ant in ants:
        # Ant Behavior
        if ant.state == 'foraging':
            - Follow pheromone trail (if present) or move randomly
            - If food is found, pick it up and change state to 'returning'
            - Deposit pheromone trail as ant moves

        elif ant.state == 'returning':
            - Follow pheromone trail back to nest
            - Deposit pheromone trail as ant moves
            - If nest is reached, drop food and change state to 'idle'

        elif ant.state == 'idle':
            - Check for tasks based on response thresholds (e.g., foraging, caring for young)
            - Engage in task if stimulus intensity exceeds response threshold

    # Update Pheromone Trails
    - Evaporate pheromone trails based on evaporation rate
    - Diffuse pheromone trails based on diffusion rate

    # Update Environment
    - Update food sources (reduce amount if ants have collected food)
    - Update nest (increase food amount if ants have returned with food)

# Labor Division Model
- Implement the Fixed Response Threshold Model (FRTM) as described by Bonabeau et al. (1996)
  - Each task has a stimulus value and ants respond based on their individual response thresholds

# Decision-Making
- Ants choose next steps based on pheromone concentrations and task stimuli
  - Use transition probabilities similar to the Ant System algorithm

```

### Implementation in Python

Here is a simplified example of how you might implement this in Python using the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries for environment representation and visualization.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random

class Ant:
    def __init__(self, position, nest_position):
        self.position = position
        self.nest_position = nest_position
        self.state = 'foraging'
        self.task = None

    def follow_pheromone(self, pheromone_trails):
        # Simplified version: follow the highest pheromone concentration
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        max_pheromone = 0
        best_direction = random.choice(directions)
        for direction in directions:
            new_position = (self.position + direction, self.position + direction)
            if 0 <= new_position < len(pheromone_trails) and 0 <= new_position < len(pheromone_trails):
                pheromone_level = pheromone_trails[new_position, new_position]
                if pheromone_level > max_pheromone:
                    max_pheromone = pheromone_level
                    best_direction = direction
        self.position = (self.position + best_direction, self.position + best_direction)

    def deposit_pheromone(self, pheromone_trails):
        pheromone_trails[self.position, self.position] += 1

    def update_state(self, food_positions):
        if self.state == 'foraging' and self.position in food_positions:
            self.state = 'returning'
        elif self.state == 'returning' and self.position == self.nest_position:
            self.state = 'idle'

def simulate(ants, pheromone_trails, food_positions, nest_position, evaporation_rate, diffusion_rate, steps):
    for step in range(steps):
        for ant in ants:
            if ant.state == 'foraging':
                ant.follow_pheromone(pheromone_trails)
                ant.deposit_pheromone(pheromone_trails)
            elif ant.state == 'returning':
                ant.follow_pheromone(pheromone_trails)
                ant.deposit_pheromone(pheromone_trails)
            ant.update_state(food_positions)

        # Evaporate and diffuse pheromone trails
        pheromone_trails *= (1 - evaporation_rate)
        pheromone_trails = np.pad(pheromone_trails, 1, mode='constant')
        for i in range(1, len(pheromone_trails) - 1):
            for j in range(1, len(pheromone_trails) - 1):
                pheromone_trails[i, j] += diffusion_rate * (pheromone_trails[i-1, j] + pheromone_trails[i+1, j] + pheromone_trails[i, j-1] + pheromone_trails[i, j+1]) / 4
        pheromone_trails = pheromone_trails[1:-1, 1:-1]

    return pheromone_trails

# Initialize environment and ants
grid_size = 50
nest_position = (grid_size // 2, grid_size // 2)
food_positions = [(10, 10), (40, 40)]
ants = [Ant((nest_position + random.randint(-5, 5), nest_position + random.randint(-5, 5)), nest_position) for _ in range(100)]
pheromone_trails = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size))

# Run simulation
evaporation_rate = 0.1
diffusion_rate = 0.05
steps = 100
final_pheromone_trails = simulate(ants, pheromone_trails, food_positions, nest_position, evaporation_rate, diffusion_rate, steps)

# Visualize results
plt.imshow(final_pheromone_trails, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()
```

### Key Points

- **Ant Movement and Pheromone Trails**: Ants follow pheromone trails and deposit pheromones as they move. The `follow_pheromone` method simplifies this by choosing the direction with the highest pheromone concentration.
- **State Updates**: Ants update their states based on whether they find food or return to the nest.
- **Evaporation and Diffusion**: Pheromone trails evaporate and diffuse over time, which is simulated using simple multiplication and averaging operations.
- **Labor Division**: The Fixed Response Threshold Model (FRTM) can be integrated by assigning tasks to ants based on their response thresholds and the stimulus intensity of the tasks.

### Future Enhancements

- **More Realistic Movement**: Implement more sophisticated movement rules, such as those described in the NetLogo models, where ants "sniff" in multiple directions and follow the gradient of the pheromone.
- **Dynamic Task Assignment**: Implement dynamic task assignment based on the response threshold model, where ants switch tasks based on the stimulus intensity and their individual response thresholds.
- **Visualization**: Enhance visualization to show the movement of ants, the formation of pheromone trails, and the exploitation of food sources over time.

This model provides a basic framework that can be expanded and refined to incorporate more detailed aspects of ant behavior and social dynamics.
