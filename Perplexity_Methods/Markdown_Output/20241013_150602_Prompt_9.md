The formation of supercolonies in invasive ant species is a complex phenomenon influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Here are some of the latest findings from studies conducted over the past three years:

## Genetic Factors

### Loss of Genetic Diversity and Recognition Cues
One of the key genetic factors contributing to supercolony formation is the loss of genetic diversity, particularly in the context of recognition cues. This loss can lead to a reduction in intraspecific aggression, allowing unrelated colonies to merge. For example, a study on the odorous house ant (*Tapinoma sessile*) suggests that a genetic bottleneck can result in the loss of recognition cue diversity, facilitating the fusion of colonies and the formation of supercolonies.

### Trait Plasticity
Invasive ant populations often exhibit trait plasticity, which includes changes in social structure, behavior, and diet. This plasticity can enhance their invasive potential. A study on *Technomyrmex brunneus*, an invasive ant species in Japan, found that the population forming a supercolony did not show the expected lower genetic diversity, but it did differ in diet compared to other populations. This suggests that trait plasticity, rather than genetic diversity alone, may play a significant role in facilitating invasiveness.

## Environmental Triggers

### Ecological Constraints
Environmental constraints such as seasonal shortages in nest and food availability can drive the formation of supercolonies. A study on *Tapinoma sessile* found that colonies are highly aggressive to each other but can fuse under laboratory conditions when competing for limited nesting and food resources. This fusion can lead to the formation of larger, more productive colonies, especially in urban areas where ecological constraints are prevalent.

### Polydomy and Polygyny
The ability to form multiple nests (polydomy) and have multiple queens (polygyny) is a common trait among invasive ant species that form supercolonies. For instance, the European fire ant (*Myrmica rubra*) exhibits high nest densities facilitated by polygyny and polydomy, which are more pronounced in their established invasive ranges compared to their native range.

### Human Activities
Human activities, such as international commerce and unintentional dispersal of infested soils, play a significant role in the spread and establishment of invasive ant species. These activities can lead to the introduction of ants into new habitats where they can form supercolonies. For example, the Argentine ant (*Linepithema humile*) has been introduced to various regions globally through human activities, leading to the formation of massive supercolonies.

## Behavioral Mechanisms

### Colony Fusion
Colony fusion is a behavioral mechanism that contributes to supercolony formation. Studies have shown that nearby competing colonies can fuse to create larger and more productive colonies if the benefits of increased colony size supersede the costs of mortality sustained during merging. This process has been observed in *Tapinoma sessile* and *Linepithema humile*, where colonies permanently merge after initial fighting, often resulting in the survival of only one queen.

### Absence of Territorial Behavior
Supercolonial populations are characterized by the absence of territorial behavior and intraspecific aggression. This allows for the extensive intermixing of queens and workers among component nests, facilitating the formation and maintenance of large supercolonies. This is evident in species like *Linepithema humile*, where supercolonial populations exhibit dense networks of interconnected nests that are genetically indistinguishable from each other.

In summary, the latest findings indicate that supercolony formation in invasive ant species is driven by a combination of genetic factors, such as trait plasticity and the loss of recognition cue diversity, and environmental triggers, including ecological constraints, human activities, and specific behavioral mechanisms like colony fusion and the absence of territorial behavior. These factors collectively enable invasive ants to dominate new environments and form extensive supercolonies.
