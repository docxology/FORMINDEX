    "abstract": "Maintaining and updating FORMIS requires the cooperative efforts of myrmecologists throughout the world.  >>Please begin by inspecting citations of your own work for accuracy and completeness<<.  The addition of keywords and/or abstracts would be especially useful.  Please see the next section for instructions about how to contribute or update citations.  AGRICOLA will be searched to keep FORMIS updated; however, this will only find a small portion of the literature.  It is hoped that this database will become a magnet and distribution mechanism for specialty ant bibliographies like the Fire Ant Literature Database.  Specialty bibliographies are needed for genera such as Formica, Camponotus, Myrmica, Pheidole, Monomorium, Messor and Cataglyphis to name a few.  Specialty bibliographies on subjects such as foraging, bioenergetics, myrmecophiles, and ant-plant symbioses would also be useful.  Geographic bibliographies for places like Hawaii, India, Mexico, Brazil, etc. could also be assembled.  Specialty bibliographies can range from a few dozen citations to several thousand; the only requirement is that they be thorough.  New citations could also be added by journal.  Please contact Dr. Porter if you are interested in adding a bibliography to FORMIS.  Users are welcome to create their own customized bibliographies from FORMIS; however, they should be aware that personal modifications to FORMIS will be lost in future updates if they are not sent in for official inclusion.  Also, users who use EndNote to automatically create bibliographies at the end of their papers should be aware that citation numbers in FORMIS will not be consistant from year to year, so a paper started on one database needs to be finished on the same one.",

The pollination biology of the chasmogamous flowers of E. virginiana is unknown. In September 2011-2012, we observed insect visitors to E. virginiana flowers. Insect visitors included Bombus impatiens, Crematogaster spp., and Prenolepis imparis, but were dominated by P. imparis (over 96% of insect visits). In September 2012, we captured ants (Crematogaster and P. imparis) on E. virginiana flowers in three different areas found in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic provinces. With the use of 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), we tested E. virginiana pollen from flowers and ant integuments for viability. We observed no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the viability of pollen taken directly from E. virginiana flowers and pollen removed from the ants. Our data suggests that ants can be playing an important role in the pollination of E. virginiana.",

    "abstract": "Few previous studies have assessed the role of herbivores and the third trophic level in the evolution of local adaptation in plants. The overall objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether local adaptation is present in the ant-defended plant, Chamaecrista fasciculata, and (2) the contribution of ant-plant-herbivore interactions and soil source to such adaptation. We used three C. fasciculata populations and performed both a field and a greenhouse experiment. The first involved reciprocally transplanting C. fasciculate seedlings from each population-source to each site, and subsequently applying one of three treatments to one-third of the seedlings of each population-source at each site: control, reduced ant density and reduced folivory. The greenhouse experiment involved reciprocal transplants of population-sources with soil sources to test for a soil-source effect on flower production and local adaptation to soil conditions. Field results showed that ant and herbivore treatments reduced ant density (increasing folivory) and herbivore damage relative to controls, respectively; however, these manipulations did not impact C. fasciculata reproduction or the likelihood of survival. In contrast, greenhouse results showed that soil source significantly affected flower production. Overall, plants in both experiments, regardless of population-source, always had higher reproductive output at one specific site. Native populations did not outperform nonnative ones, causing us to reject the hypothesis of local adaptation. The absence of treatment effects on plant reproduction and the likelihood of survival suggest a limited effect of ants and folivores on C. fasciculata fitness and local adaptation during the study year. Temporally inconsistent effects of biotic forces across years, coupled with the young age of populations, relative proximity of populations and possible counter effects of seed predators may reduce the likelihood of local adaptation in the populations studied.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence for the influence of plant intraspecific variation on associated multi-trophic communities, but the traits driving such effects are largely unknown. We conducted a field experiment with selected genetic lines of the dioecious shrub Baccharis salicifolia to investigate the effects of plant growth rate (two-fold variation) and gender (males vs. females of the same growth rate) on above- and belowground insect and fungal associates. We documented variation in associate density to test for effects occurring through plant-based habitat quality (controlling for effects of plant size) as well as variation in associate abundance to test for effects occurring through both habitat quality and abundance (including effects of plant size). Whereas the dietary specialist aphid Uroleucon macolai was unaffected by plant sex and growth rate, the generalist aphid Aphis gossypii and its tending ants (Linepithema humile) had higher abundances and densities on male (vs. female) plants, suggesting males provide greater habitat quality. In contrast, Aphis and ant abundance and density were unaffected by plant growth rate, while Aphis parasitoids were unaffected by either plant sex or growth rate. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi had higher abundance and density (both marginally significant) on females (vs. males), suggesting females provide greater habitat quality, but lower abundances (marginally significant) and higher densities on slow- (vs. fast-) growing genotypes, suggesting slow-growing genotypes provided lower resource abundance but greater habitat quality. Overall, plant sex and growth rate effects on associates acted independently (i.e., no interactive effects), and these effects were of a greater magnitude than those coming from other axes of plant genetic variation. These findings thus demonstrate that plant genetic effects on associated communities may be driven by a small number of trait-specific mechanisms.",

Yet, the plant traits underlying these effects, the extended consequences for higher trophic levels (i.e. predators), and the implications for plant growth and reproduction have received little attention. Here, we asked whether simulated early insect leaf damage on wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) affected subsequent damage by insect leaf chewers and pathogenic fungi, as well as ant abundance. To address the mechanisms behind such effects, we measured plant defensive traits induced by early leaf damage to determine which inducible traits might determine the effects on plant\u0010associates. We also evaluated whether early damage influenced plant growth and flower production, and if such effects were mediated by subsequent insect herbivory or pathogen infection. We show that simulated early leaf damage reduced damage by subsequent leaf\u0010chewing insects, increased plant fungal infections, but did not affect ant abundance. Leaf defensive traits (lignins and pubescence) were significantly induced by early damage and were negatively associated with insect herbivory and infection severity, but did not account for the effects of early leaf damage on either of these subsequent attackers. In addition, ant abundance was not associated with (or accounted for) subsequent herbivory or infection, suggesting they did not confer plant protection. Finally, early leaf damage negatively affected plant growth and flower production and analyses suggested that the effect on the latter was, at least partly, mediated by increased fungal infections. Synthesis. Overall, these findings show that early herbivory determines the outcome of cotton interactions with subsequent attackers, and such effects have an impact on plant growth and flower output.",

    "abstract": "Invasiveness of non-native species often depends on acquired interactions with either native or naturalized species. A natural colonizer, the autogamous, invasive orchid Spathoglottis plicata has acquired at least three interspecific interactions in Puerto Rico: a mycorrhizal fungus essential for seed germination and early development; a native, orchid-specialist weevil, Stethobaris polita, which eats perianth parts and oviposits in developing fruits; and ants, primarily invasive Solenopsis invicta, that forage at extrafloral nectaries. We tested in field experiments and from observational data whether weevils affect reproductive success in the orchid; and whether this interaction is density-dependent. We also examined the effectiveness of extrafloral nectaries in attracting ants that ward off weevils. Only at small spatial scales were weevil abundance and flower damage correlated with flower densities. Plants protected from weevils had less floral damage and higher fruit set than those accessible to weevils. The more abundant ants were on inflorescences, the less accessible fruits were to weevils, resulting in reduced fruit loss from larval infections. Ants did not exclude weevils, but they affected weevil activity. Native herbivores generally provide some biotic resistance to plant invasions yet Spathoglottis plicata remains an aggressive colonizer despite the acquisition of a herbivore/seed predator partly because invasive ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries inhibited weevil behavior. Thus, the invasion of one species facilitates the success of another as in invasional meltdowns. For invasive plant species of disturbed habitats, having ant-tended extrafloral nectaries and producing copious quantities of seed, biotic resistance to plant invasions can be minimal.",

A bioassay of ant behavior revealed aversion to young and mature unisexual flowers of sponge gourd in the five predominantly EF nectary-visiting ant species, while floral preference was demonstrated in T. melanocephalum.  A significant difference was not found in the number of insect pollinators visiting T. melanocephalum occupied and un-occupied flowers, suggesting the absence of deterrent effect of this tiny ant species on the pollinators.  3. Further behavioral assays showed preference for 2- and 4-day-old leaves and also 2-day-old buds, while the 4-day-old buds induced avoidance in all the species. Androecium and gynoecium had significantly higher repellent effects in comparison to the petals. Thus floral repellents probably help to reduce nectar theft and prevent loss of pollen function.    4. This aversion was not demonstrated in the case of old flowers. A significantly greater number of insect pollinators visited young and mature flowers compared with old flowers, suggesting that selective exclusion of medium- and large-sized EF nectary-visiting ant species from the flowers, as a result of aversion to floral repellents, serves to avoid the threat of attack to insect pollinators of sponge gourd.",

    "abstract": "Induced chemical responses following herbivory are common in plants. Plant responses that change the level of physical or biotic defense are less well documented and poorly understood. Many Azteca spp. ants are obligate inhabitants of Cecropia spp. trees. In such ant\u0013plant associations the ants are thought to be analogous to chemical defenses; previous experiments have demonstrated that ant occupation of C. obtusifolia reduced herbivory and plant competition and increased growth. Experiments, conducted over two years, on the dynamics of ant defense demonstrate that leaf damage caused a fivefold increase in the number of Azteca spp. ants on damaged leaves of C. obtusifolia compared to that on disturbed but undamaged control leaves. Ant activity peaked 8\u001312 min after damage, and differences between damaged and control leaves remained evident for 24 h. Such rapid induction of ant recruitment is likely to be particularly effective against unpredictable and mobile herbivores. The magnitude of the induced ant response to damage was strongly correlated with the number of ants patrolling the leaves before damage occurred. Ant responses to disturbance were not influenced by the presence of damage that had been applied 24 h previously. However, ant responses to subsequent damage, 24 h after initial damage, resulted in greater recruitment than to previously undamaged leaves. Ant recruitment to several other cues associated with herbivory was also tested. Presence of pyralid caterpillars that naturally feed on C. obtusifolia induced a low level of ant recruitment, and most larvae were removed from leaves by the ants within 10 min. Exposure to plant sap collected from damaged conspecifics and a commercially available green leaf volatile (hexanal) commonly released by plants after damage, both resulted in a doubling of ant numbers relative to controls. However, the levels of recruitment in response to these stimuli were insufficient to account for the high numbers of ants and persistence of recruitment observed on experimentally damaged leaves. Experimental wounding of leaves with minimal leaf tissue removal (using pin pricks) revealed that leaf wounds per se can only partially explain the induced ant recruitment following leaf damage. The type of herbivory and size of leaf wounds may be important cues for ant recruitment. Severed C. obtusifolia leaves that were freshly damaged failed to elicit an induced ant response when held adjacent to conspecific leaves with ants. However, induction of ant recruitment on damaged plants did significantly induce a low level of ant recruitment on neighboring conspecifics, providing evidence for interplant communication. Induced ant responses in the Cecropia\u0013Azteca system are the result of multiple physical and chemical cues associated with herbivory. Ant responses to herbivory, although not previously studied in detail, are likely to be common among myrmecophytic plants and are likely to be an important component of antiherbivore defense in such systems.",

Previous studies have neglected the dynamic nature of defense in ant-plants.  Changes in environmental cues can trigger modifications in a plant's defensive strategy (= induced responses).  In ant-plants, many cues & signals controlled by the plant & the environment can enhance defense by influencing recruitment, patrolling, & persistence of ants.  Leaf damage may trigger plant signals such as the release of plant sap or green leaf volatiles that attract ant defenders.  Similarly, disturbance & mammalian breath may themselves induce ants to recruit.  We, also, review studies that have looked for changes in extrafloral nectar production induced by herbivory.  Induced responses to herbivory that stimulate changes in nectar volume, sugar concentration, & amino acid concentration of extrafloral nectar have been reported.  This should increase patrolling by defending ants.  We propose that non-nectary mediated ant recruitment should also occur, but may be restricted to tightly linked ant-plant systems.  We suggest that induced responses to herbivory are  common in ant-plants.]",

    "abstract": "Disturbances such as fire, grazing, and soil mixing by animals interact to shape vegetation in grassland ecosystems. Animal-generated disturbances are unique in that they arise from a suite of behaviors that are themselves subject to modification by external factors. The manner in which co-occurring animal taxa interact to alter vegetation is a function of their respective behaviors, which shape the characteristics (e.g., the magnitude or extent) of their disturbances. To determine whether prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) interactively alter vegetation structure and heterogeneity on the Colorado shortgrass steppe, we characterized the size, dispersion, and vegetation of prairie dog burrow mounds and ant nests (located on and off prairie dog colonies) and vegetation growing beyond mound and nest perimeters. Ants located on prairie dog colonies engineered significantly larger nests and disturbed nearly twice as much total soil area as their off-colony counterparts. Ant nests were overdispersed both on and off prairie dog colonies, while prairie dog mounds were randomly dispersed. Where harvester ants and prairie dogs co-occur, the overdispersed pattern of on-colony ant nests is in effect 'overlaid' onto the random pattern of prairie dog mounds, resulting in a unique, aggregated pattern of soil disturbance. Ant nests on prairie dog colonies had significantly less vegetation and lower plant species diversity than did prairie dog mounds, while off-colony nests were similar to mounds. These results suggest that ant nests are more highly disturbed when located on prairie dog colonies. Beyond nests proper, ants did not appear to alter vegetation in a manner distinct from prairie dogs. As such, the interactive effects of prairie dogs and ants on vegetation arise mainly from the disturbance characteristics of mounds and nests proper.",

    "abstract": "Defensive mutualisms mediated by extrafloral nectaries are particularly variable; their net results may change with seasons, communities and environmental contexts. Particularly, an environmental factor that can promote changes in outcomes of ant-plant interactions is elevation in mountainous regions. We tested whether (1) the interaction between the cactus Opuntia sulphurea and ant visitors of extrafloral nectaries is a defensive mutualism; and (2) ant-plant interaction outcomes vary with elevation as a result of changes in herbivory rate and ant activity. To evaluate if the outcome of interactions was consistent at two extremes of the range distribution of O. sulphurea, we performed an ant-exclusion experiment with plants at two growth conditions (natural or potted) in two sites with contrasting elevation (1235-1787 m asl) in a temperate region (Villavicencio Nature Reserve, Mendoza, Argentina), and in a tropical region (Huajchilla, La Paz, Bolivia). Although herbivory rate and ant visitation frequency increased with elevation, herbivore damage, plant reproductive success, and cladode growth rate were similar between plants excluded and non-excluded from ants among sites, geographic regions and growth conditions. These results do not support the hypotheses that the interaction between O. sulphurea and ants is a defensive mutualism, and that elevation affects the net outcome of this ant-plant interaction.          *[We found 80-100 percent of natural & potted plants in Villavicencio & La Paz had at least one ant-visitor during the study period.  Six species of ants from 3 subfamilies visited extrafloral nectaries of O. suphurea in Villavicencio: Camponotus mus, Brachymyrmex sp., Camponotus sp., Pheidole sp, Forelius sp.1, & Dorymyrmex sp.1.  We recorded the same ant species in lower & upper sites in Villavicencio, & the frequency of ants that visited the extrafloral nectaries was strongly correlated between morning/noon & afternoon/night.  In La Paz, we recorded 4 species of ants from 2 subfamilies: Camponotus compositor, Forelius sp.2, Dorymyrmex sp.2, & Linepithema sp.  Camponotus mus was the most frequent visitor species in Villavicencio, followed by Brachymyrmex sp., especially at the upper site.  The visitation frequency of the other species was much lower at both study sites & growth conditions.  A total of 16 ant-herbivore interactions were identified throughout the study in Villavicencio, 9 at the upper site & 7 at the lower site.  Ants behaved neutrally in 8 cases & antagonistically in one case in the upper site, neutrally in 3 cases & antagonistically in 4 cases in the lower site.

The study was conducted in 3 forest fragments & in a pasture, in the Vale do Para\u00ccba, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  To assess the seed removal rate & the dispersal distance, 40 observation stations were established in each environment, each station containing 6 seeds of Carica papaya L (papaya).  In order to study germinated seeds & soil chemical properties, soil samples were collected in nests of Odontomachus chelifer (Latreille) & Pachycondyla striata Fr. Smith & in adjacent sites.  The plant abundance & plant species richness, from 5cm to 30cm in height, were obtained in parcels delimited over each nest & in adjacent sites.  Seventeen species removed 316 seeds (32.92% of total seeds exposed), with P. striata removing the most seeds, followed by O. chelifer.  In 120 samples of soil, 980 plants germinated, belonging to 46 species.  In general, the abundance of plants, the number of germinated seeds & the species richness were higher in nests of O. chelifer & P. striata than in adjacent sites.  The seed removal rate is potentiated in environments with higher densities of P. striata nests.  The species O. chelifer & P. striata remove the seeds to their nests.  This interaction can provide advantages for plants because the soil of the nests has better chemical properties for seed germination & plant growth.  These ants are ecosystem engineers & contribute to the success of plant establishment & for biodiversity conservation in the Vale do Para\u00ccba.]",

The ant occupants of 14 C. setosa clones were censused 4 times over a 14-mo period at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, and twice over a 9-mo period at the Nusagandi Station, Panama.  Twelve facultative ant species occupied C. setosa stems at La Selva, compared to 6 facultative and one obligate species at Nusagandi.  Occupancy (as % of stems ever occupied/clone) was higher at Nusagandi (median = 89%) compared to La Selva (65%).  Occupancy varied among clones at La Selva, but not at Nusagandi.  C. setosa clones differed between sites, with larger clones & more small stems/clone at La Selva.  Occupancy was influenced by clone structure; larger clones contained more ant species at both sites & had lower occupancy at La Selva.  Occupancy was highest in larger stems & lowest in small stems at both sites.  Temporally, percent occupation/clone did not differ among censuses at either site, but overall occupancy was lower in the dry season at La Selva.  Turnover in ant occupants was higher at La Selva, than at Nusagandi.  The variation observed in this study is likely due to a number of factors, including differences between sites in plant population structure & history, differences between & within sites in ant faunas & their nesting requirements, and changes over space & time in microclimatic variables.]",

In the first part of the thesis, we show how an abiotic variable (fire) affected the facultative mutualism between ants & plants, & how ants & herbivores responded to the resprouting of plants after fire.  It was shown that fire promoted a rapid growth of Banisteriopsis campestris & affected the quality of extrafloral nectar, by increasing sugar concentration.  As a consequence, more ants were attracted to the plants, thus decreasing herbivory rates.  Nonetheless, in other plant species (Banisteriopsis malifolia), tiny herbivores were immune to ant attack & inflicted serious damage to leaves.  The second part of the thesis, we show that predatory wasps were more important than ants in the deterrence of endophytic beetles.  In the third part of the thesis, we show how plant-insect relationships are conditional (to biotic or abiotic factors) & the strategies that caterpillars & thrips use to escape from ant attack while feeding on plant reproductive parts.  Florivorous myrmecophilous lycaenid caterpillars release sugared substances to antguards & are not attacked.  Thrips co-occurred with ants in extrafloral nectaried plants & their herbivory may seem small and negligible in leaves & flower buds, but fruits (samaras) damaged by thrips are distorted & asymmetric (which restrains its dispersive capabilities by wind).]",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic disturbances decrease the resources available to ants and simplify the ant fauna. This could affect ant\u0013plant interactions, especially if key-species disappear. In terms of conservation, disturbances can select for ants resilient to disturbances, and such species can be considered indicators of succession processes. Here, we investigated the extent to which a vegetation clearcutting event (by bulldozer) affected the communities of both plants (seven species of Bignoniaceae) and associated ants. We hypothesized that only generalist ants would remain after clearcutting. Clearcutting reduced plant abundance, with only 40% of individuals resprouting after disturbance. Plant species richness was not affected by clearcutting, but ant species richness was lower in disturbed than in undisturbed conditions (four instead of seven species). Camponotus ants were dominant and were found regularly on all plant species before and after clearcutting. These ants had high centrality values and were regarded as influential species in the structure of the ant\u0013plant network. Camponotus are generalists and nest in the soil; thus, clearcutting did not affect them to the same degree as the ants that nest in plants. The ant\u0013plant network showed no changes in the specialization index (H\u00c72), indicating that even with losses of some ant species, the network properties were maintained: plants were still being visited by ants. Therefore, we show that clearcutting had a weak effect on ant\u0013plant interactions, especially because Camponotus buffered the losses of other ants.",

    "abstract": "Females of myrmecophilous butterflies tend to oviposit in plants visited by ant species that engage in stable associations with its larvae. In Banisteriopsis malifolia, caterpillars are attended by the same ants that feed on extrafloral nectaries. A conflict may arise when both the plant and caterpillars compete for ant attention, and ants are assumed to forage on the highest quality resource. By attending caterpillars, ants can be indirectly detrimental to plant fitness because florivorous larvae feed intensively until pupation. In this study, we specifically investigated (i) whether the occurrence of facultative myrmecophilous Synargis calyce (Riodinidae) caterpillars in B. malifolia was based on ant species (Camponotus blandus or Ectatomma tuberculatum) and abundance; (ii) the monopolization of ants by the butterfly larvae and (iii) the florivory rates incurred by the caterpillars on inflorescences. The abundance of S. calyce was six\u0010fold greater in plants with C. blandus, compared to E. tuberculatum treatments. Caterpillars monopolized up to 50% of C. blandus on the plants, indicating that the resources offered by S. calyce were more attractive to ants than extrafloral nectaries. Florivory by riodinids incurred losses of almost 60% of flower buds. Myrmecophilous riodinids exploited an ant-plant mutualism by attracting aggressive ants that become larvae bodyguards. Thus, this ecological interaction is potentially detrimental to B. malifolia, since the ants, which can provide protection against herbivores, shift to provide defence for one of these herbivores.",

    "abstract": "Fires in the Cerrado savanna are a severe form of disturbance, but some species are capable of resprouting afterwards. It is unknown, however, how and whether post-fire resprouting represents a stressful condition to plants and how their rapid re-growth influences both the production of biochemical compounds, and interactions with mutualistic ants. In this study, we examined the influence of post-fire resprouting on biotic interactions (ant-plant-herbivore relationships) and on plant stress. The study was performed on two groups of the extrafloral nectaried shrub Banisteriopsis campestris (Malpighiaceae); one group was recovering from fire while the other acted as control. With respect to biotic interactions, we examined whether resprouting influenced extrafloral nectar concentration (milligrams per microliter), the abundance of the ant Camponotus crassus and leaf herbivory rates. Plant stress was assessed via fluctuating asymmetry (FA) analysis, which refers to deviations from perfect symmetry in bilaterally symmetrical traits (e.g., leaves) and indicates whether species are under stress. Results revealed that FA, sugar concentration, and ant abundance were 51.7 %, 35.7 % and 21.7 % higher in resprouting plants. Furthermore, C. crassus was significantly associated with low herbivory rates, but only in resprouting plants. This study showed that post-fire resprouting induced high levels of plant stress and influenced extrafloral nectar quality and ant-herbivore relationships in B. campestris. Therefore, despite being a stressful condition to the plant, post-fire resprouting individuals had concentrated extrafloral nectar and sustained more ants, thus strengthening the outcomes of ant-plant mutualism.",

However, in extrafloral nectaried plants, young leaves also attract patrolling ants, which may chase or prey on herbivores. We examined this scenario in extrafloral nectaried shrubs of Banisteriopsis malifolia resprouting after fire, which promoted both the aseasonal production of leaves and the activity of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). Results were compared between resprouting (burned) and unburned control plants. The aggressive ant species Camponotus crassus and the herbivorous thrips Pseudophilothrips obscuricornis were respectively rapidly attracted to resprouting plants because of the active EFNs and their less sclerophyllous leaves. The abundance of these insects was almost negligible in the control (unburned) shrubs. Ants failed to protect B. malifolia, as no thrips were preyed upon or injured by ants in resprouting plants. Consequently, on average, 37 % of leaves from resprouting shrubs had necrosis marks. Upon contact with ants, thrips released small liquid droplets from their abdomen, which rapidly displaced ants from the surroundings. This study shows that P. obscuricornis disrupted the facultative mutualism between C. crassus and B. malifolia, since ants received extrafloral nectar from plants, but were unable to deter herbivore thrips.",

    "abstract": "Ants co\u0010occur with herbivorous thrips in several tropical plants, but their interactions are largely unexplored. Should thrips be deterred by ants, a positive effect of ants on plant fitness might be expected. Here, by using an experimental study design with ant\u0010present and ant\u0010excluded treatments, we investigated the influence of Camponotus blandus on Pseudophilothrips obscuricornis abundance and herbivory in three extrafloral nectaried species: Banisteriopsis malifolia, B.\tlaevifolia and B.\tstellaris. In addition, we examined the effect of thrips herbivory on flower set and fruit development and dispersion. Thrips abundance and herbivory were higher on ant\u0010present stems of B.\tmalifolia and B.\tlaevifolia, where thrips managed to escape from ants by hiding in between clusters of flower buds (thygmotaxis behaviour). In B.\tstellaris the results were the opposite, as flower bud clusters did not offer hiding places, so thrips were unable to hide from ants; thus both thrips abundance and herbivory were lower on ant\u0010present stems. Thrips herbivory had no significant effect on flower and fruit set, but samaras (V\u0010shaped winged fruits of Malpighiaceae) attacked by thrips presented severe distortions and asymmetries. This caused damaged fruits to be dispersed closer to the mother plant, whereas uninjured fruits were dispersed further away. This study is evidence that ant-plant-herbivore systems have variable outcomes depending on the species involved, their behaviour and the plant structure under consideration. Unlike other herbivores, thrips negatively influence the very last stage of plant reproduction. The minute and furtive herbivorous thrips have long been ignored in natural systems, but because of their wide host range, they may be important herbivores even in extrafloral nectaried plants, which are usually fiercely protected by ants.",

Workers were marked and followed at three locations: on the leaves, tree trunk, and ground near the plant. Behavioral tests were performed, testing the reactions of marked ants toward the food used to feed the larvae (Beltian Bodies, \"BB\"), and to brood outside the spines. Marked ants and ants of known age were tested for responses to disturbance of the spines. Ants were more likely to occur in the location where they were originally marked. Trunk-marked ants discarded the BB when it had a foliole fragment attached to it, while leaf-marked ants carried it to the spine. Trunk-marked ants left larvae and exited from disturbed spines more frequently than other ants. Leaf-marked ants carried larvae and pupae more often than trunk-marked ants. Spine-marked ants left pupae more often than trunk- or leaf-marked ants. When considering age, older ants reacted aggressively when threatened, whereas younger ants protected the brood. However, younger ants reacted more aggressively when older ants were absent, and older ants were more aggressive in the presence of larvae. In sum, the spatial segregation of the ants coincided with behavioral differences, and different behavioral responses are related to the age of the ant.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic species often associate with several partners that vary in the benefits provided. In some protective ant\u0013plant mutualisms, ants vary in the extent at which they kill neighboring vegetation. Particularly, in acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex), the area around the host tree that ants keep free from vegetation ('clearings') vary depending on the species. This study assessed whether interspecific variation in clearing size corresponds to workers biting on plant tissue of different thickness. As expected, workers from species making the largest clearings bit more often on thicker plant tissues than workers from species making smaller clearings. Because head shape affects mandible force, I also assessed whether pruning on thick tissue in mutualistic ant species or being a predator in non\u0010mutualistic species correlated with broader heads, which yield stronger mandible force. The species with the broader heads were non\u0010mutualistic predators or mutualistic pruners of thick tissues, which suggest that pruning neighboring vegetation in non\u0010predatory species demands force even when the ants do not kill prey with their mandibles. The findings reveal that clearing size variation in mutualistic ant partners of plants can also be observed at the level of individual decision\u0010making processes among workers, and suggest that head morphology could be a trait under selection in protective ant-plant mutualisms.

Spine diameter was smaller in parasite-inhabited plants, but there were no differences in spine length, suggesting that spines serve as mechanical protection against herbivory.

To examine ant-mediated indirect effects of the aphid on the leafhopper and geometrid moth caterpillars, we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated aphid densities. The aphid decreased the density of these herbivorous insects through ant-mediated indirect effects, because honeydew scattered by the aphid-attracted ants that then removed them. To examine plant-mediated indirect effects of the aphid on two temporally separated insects, a scale insect and a grasshopper, we compared the density and performance of these herbivorous insects on aphid-inoculated plants and aphid-free plants. Aphid-induced plant modifications had different effects on the scale insect and grasshopper. The aphid indirectly decreased the density and survivorship of the scale insect. On the other hand, the number of grasshoppers increased as a result of the increased number of leaves and the increased nitrogen content induced by prior aphid feeding. However, aphid infestation did not affect the survival of the grasshopper. Thus, the aphid has large indirect effects on co-occurring herbivorous insects through the removal behavior of tending ants and on temporally separated herbivorous insects through changes in quality and quantity of the tall goldenrod.",

    "abstract": "Plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) vary the secretion of nectar between day and night, which creates turnover in the composition of interacting ant species. Daily variation in the composition of ant species foraging on vegetation is commonly observed, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. We evaluated the daily variation in nectar availability and interspecific aggressiveness between ants as possible regulatory mechanisms of the turnover in ant\u0013plant interactions. We hypothesized that (i) plants would interact with more ant species during periods of higher secretion of nectar and that (ii) aggressive ant species would compete for nectar, creating a daily turnover of species collecting nectar. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the production of nectar during the day and night and by experimentally removing EFNs of Bionia coriacea (=Camptosema coriaceum) (Nees & Mart.) Benth. (Fabaceae: Faboideae) plants in a Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). We then compared the abundance and composition of ant species between those treatments and during the day. Our results indicate that more ant workers forage on plants during the day, when nectar was sugary, while more ant species forage at night, when aggressiveness between ant species was lower. We also detected a day/night turnover in ant species composition. Ant species foraging for nectar during the day were not the same at night, and this turnover did not occur on plants without EFNs. Both dominant ant species, diurnal Camponotus crassus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and nocturnal Camponotus rufipes (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), were the most aggressive species, attacking other ants in their specific periods of forage while also being very aggressive toward each other. However, this aggressiveness did not occur in the absence of nectar, which allowed non\u0010aggressive nocturnal ant species to forage only during the daytime, disrupting the turnover. We conclude that extrafloral\u0010nectar presence and interspecific aggressiveness between ants, along with other environmental factors, are important mechanisms creating turnovers in ants foraging on plants.",

    "abstract": "Diaspore (e.g. seeds, fruits) dispersal is pivotal for plant communities and often involves several steps and different dispersing agents. Most studies focusing on diaspore dispersal by animals have highlighted the role of vertebrates, neglecting the role of ants in the diaspore dispersal of non\u0010myrmecochorous plants. Diaspore dispersal by ants is especially relevant in the current scenario of declining of vertebrate populations and, consequently, collapse of the dispersal system of large\u0010seeded plants. Although ants can never compensate for the dispersal service provided by vertebrates, they can mitigate the impact of vertebrate decline via removal of diaspores deposited on the ground. We have used a meta\u0010analytical approach to investigate the contribution of ants in the removal of non\u0010myrmecochorous diaspores (through vertebrate exclusion experiments). We considered the number of diaspore removal as effect size and factors such as plant growth forms, diaspore and ant size, habitat type as moderators. In addition, we investigated the role of such factors on the diaspore removal distance by ants. Ants played complementary role to non\u0010myrmecochorous diaspore removal services provided by vertebrates (mean Hedges'g of \u00120.30). The ant diaspore removal was 69% higher for diaspores from shrubs than that of tree diaspores and removal of small\u0010sized diaspores were 69% and 70% higher in comparison to medium\u0010 and large\u0010sized diaspores, respectively. Regarding the diaspore removal distance by ants, those of tree species were removed 32% farther than those of shrub species, and diaspores were removed three\u0010 times farther in the savanna than in rainforest ecosystems. Our results highlight the shrubs and small\u0010sized diaspores. Regarding the diaspore removal distance, the ants can be crucial for the dispersal of tree diaspores and in the savanna ecosystems. Finally, considering the biodiversity crisis, the ants may play an even more important role than appreciated in diaspores dispersal.          *[In Appendix 1: Aphaenogaster senilis misspelled Aphaenogaster senili.]",

    "abstract": "1. Harvester ants perform important ecological functions, such as seed predation and redistribution of nutrients in the soil, through a complex of ecological interactions. Most studies are static descriptions of network structure, while their temporal organisations and the factors that modulate it have been neglected. 2. This study describes the temporal organisation and the influence of climatic variables (e.g. temperature and rainfall) on network structure between a harvester ant species and its food resources (seeds and invertebrates) in the Brazilian savanna over a 1\u0010year period. In addition, considering the ant\u0013seed networks, the relationship between the size of seeds collected by ants and the distance travelled was examined, as well as how this relationship behaves over time. 3. For all network types (ant\u0013seed, ant\u0013invertebrate, and combined) there was great structural variation throughout the year. Among climatic variables, only rainfall influenced the properties of ant\u0013invertebrate networks, presenting a positive influence on diversity of interactions and a negative influence on network specialisation. Finally, this study shows that harvester ants tend to collect larger seeds in the vicinity of the nest (<\t5\tm) and smaller seeds at greater distances, and this relationship appears to be constant over time. 4. This study highlights that ecological networks are useful tools with which to understand the temporal organisation of ecological functions. In addition, climatic changes, mainly in the rainfall regime, may interfere directly in the availability of resources and ultimately in the interactions between harvester ants and their food resources.",

    "abstract": "Canopy ecology is a fast-growing field, but still a scientific frontier in many ecological aspects. For instance, the hypothesis that tree traits shape patterns in ant-plant interactions lacks data, notably for tropical canopies in different successional stages. In this study, we investigated canopy traits, such as tree height, the presence of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), connectivity among tree crowns, and successional stage, structure ant-tree interactions in a tropical dry forest (TDF), examining whether these are the determinant factors for ant species richness. We collected ants on trees in early and late successional stages over 2 years, in rainy and dry seasons. In the late successional stage, ant species richness was greater in the taller trees; in the early successional stage, the smallest trees had a greater ant species richness than the taller trees. The EFNs and connectivity among treetops had no effect on ant species richness. We obtained a tree-ant network of the early successional stage, involving 786 interactions among 57 ant species and 75 trees; in the late successional stage, the network had 914 interactions among 60 ant species and 75 trees. There were 27 species of trees in our study, 11 of which (40.7% of all individual trees) had EFNs. The ant-plant interactions were not randomly distributed, suggesting that various biotic factors structured the ant assemblies. This study presents new insights into ant-tree interactions, showing that both tree height and successional stage influence the occurrence of many species of ants in tree canopies of tropical dry forests.",

We also performed experimental manipulations of several characteristics of P. auriculata, which resulted in changes in levels of ant visitation.

    "abstract": "Many ant-plant associations are mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs): nectar-producing structures not related to pollination and commonly found on leaves and inflorescences. These sweet secretions represent a critical energy resource for many ant species and constitute the basis for protective mutualisms: by providing ants with food, ants protect plants from herbivores. Although EFN-bearing plants occur in a wide range of habitats and climates worldwide, interactions mediated by EFN-bearing plants are poorly documented in deserts. In a seasonal desert of northwestern Argentina, we show that biotic interactions between EFN-bearing plants and ants are ecologically relevant components of deserts, and that EFN-bearing plants are crucial for the survival of desert ant communities.          *[We found that 25 ant species & 11 extrafloral nectary-bearing plant species were linked together through 96 pairs of associations.  Plants bearing extrafloral nectaries were abundant, representing ca. 19 % of the species encountered in transects &  24 % of the plant cover.  Most ant species sampled (ca. 77 %) fed on extrafloral nectary nectar.  Interactions showed a marked seasonal pattern: extrafloral nectary secretion was directly related to plant phenology & correlated with the time of highest ant ground activity.]",

    "abstract": "Many arboreal ants depend on myrmecophytic plants for both food and shelter; in return, these ants defend their host plants against herbivores, which are often insects. Ant-plant and other mutualisms do not necessarily involve the exchange of costly rewards or services; they may instead result from by\u0010product benefits, or positive outcomes that do not entail a cost for one or both partners. Here, we examined whether the plant\u0010ant Allomerus octoarticulatus pays a short\u0010term cost to defend their host plants against herbivores, or whether plant defense is a by\u0010product benefit of ant foraging for insect prey. Because the food offered by ant\u0010plants is usually nitrogen\u0010poor, arboreal ants may balance their diets by consuming insect prey or associating with microbial symbionts to acquire nitrogen, potentially shifting the costs and benefits of plant defense for the ant partner. To determine the effect of ant diet on an ant-plant mutualism, we compared the behavior, morphology, fitness, stable isotope signatures, and gaster microbiomes of A. octoarticulatus ants nesting in Cordia nodosa trees maintained for nearly a year with or without insect herbivores. At the end of the experiment, ants from herbivore exclosures preferred protein\u0010rich baits more than ants in the control (i.e., herbivores present) treatment. Furthermore, workers in the control treatment were heavier than in the herbivore\u0010exclusion treatment, and worker mass predicted reproductive output, suggesting that foraging for insect prey directly increased ant colony fitness. The gaster microbiome of ants was not significantly affected by the herbivore exclusion treatment. We conclude that the defensive behavior of some phytoecious ants is a by\u0010product of their need for external protein sources; thus, the consumption of insect herbivores by ants benefits both the ant colony and the host plant.",

A highly significant negative relation was found between the percentage of W. auropunctata samples per forest fragment and richness for the ant community.   Additionally, a significant positive relationship was found between the abundance of W. auropunctata and the number of ant-plant associations in nine of the forest fragments. The displacement of other ants by W. auropunctata could be explained in terms of its competitive performance, natural history and ability to exploit disturbed sites. This opportunistic species displays high interspecific aggressiveness, recruiting workers massively to a variety of food resources. It also colonizes different substrates and forms unicolonial societies, which disperse broadly by detaching groups of workers along with multiple queens.  The species can be easily monitored with tuna baits, which showed the same significant negative relation. We propose that the abundance of the little fire ant can be used as an indicator of low diversity ant communities in dry forest fragments of the Cauca river valley of Colombia.",

    "abstract": "Nest-site limitation is an important factor regulating ant diversity, particularly at low elevations. In savannas, trees and shrubs do not support large nests in their crowns and cavities for nest sites are limited. However, bamboos are very common and can provide vertically stacked hollow chambers for ants to establish their colonies. We evaluated the bamboo species Guadua paniculata as a source of nest cavities for ants in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna). We hypothesized that the morphology of this bamboo species and its vertical arrangement regulate the distribution of ants nesting in it. Thirty bamboo patches distributed among four sites in the state of Tocantins (Brazil) were evaluated, in which 36 species of ants occupied more than half of the bamboo available. Wider and longer culms enabled a greater number of colonies of several ant species. Living or dead condition of bamboo had a significant effect on the diversity and composition of the ant fauna. Dead culms were occupied opportunistically by several generalist species, while Azteca fasciata dominated living bamboo. Finally, we observed the species distribution along a vertical gradient of bamboo height, and proposed that differential colonization of ground and canopy-dwelling species and habitat specialization may be key mechanisms for the observed pattern of distribution. This study contributes to a better understanding of species coexistence in low elevation forests in the Brazilian Cerrado by considering bamboo nest sites as a key factor affecting ant diversity.",

    "abstract": "Plants and ants have widespread relationships that are commonly mediated by the offer of extrafloral nectar (EFN) to ants that protect plants against herbivores. However, these ant-plant interactions are highly facultative and vary in time and space, mainly depending on the characteristics of the ant species, such as density and aggressiveness. In general, the outcomes of these relationships are positive, but in some cases, the presence of ants is neutral or negative to plants. Some studies suggest that aggressive attacks or merely the presence of ants might reduce the visitation rate of insect pollinators, such as bees, to flowers. We used experimental manipulation in natural conditions to test the hypothesis that ants on flowers of EFN-bearing plants might be recognized as a danger by pollinators (bees) and reduce the plant fitness (fruit-set). Our results show that the avoidance that ant bodyguard species feeding on EFNs of the Malpighiaceae Heteropterys pteropetala cause in pollinators, is not enough to decrease plant fruit-set. However, ants were indeed identified as a danger to pollinators as hypothesized and as suggested for other plant-pollinator relationships: flowers with plastic ants placed on the petals produced significantly fewer fruits than other treatments (using instead a plastic circle) or the control (natural condition). Indirect costs of facultative mutualisms are the focus of few studies and have been performed only rarely in the Neotropics; our results show that mutualism must be considered in multitrophic interactions studies for a better understanding of the functioning of the system.",

    "abstract": "*[Ants & seeds show a variety of interactions, from generalist seed harvesters to more selective elaiosome-eating ants.  Seed harvesting by ants is an interaction typical of non-forested systems from mid & low latitudes.  Most aspects of the foraging strategy of harvester ants can be interpreted as a time-saving policy.  Ants take advantage of the limited periods of time in which activity outside the nest is feasible to collect as many seeds as possible, using in many cases a trunk trail system to access to the foraging patches.  This voracious strategy inflicts severe seed losses to certain plant species.  However, harvester ants also behave as accidental seed dispersers (dyszoochory) by dropping or mislaying seeds in foraging areas, foraging trails, chaff piles; & granary chambers.  The alteration of local microsite conditions caused by harvester ants can be beneficial for the dispersed seeds.  In contrast to the less-discerning seed harvesters, some seed-feeding ants behave as true gourmets.  Myrmecochory is an interaction that requires selective ants to collect elaiosome-bearing seeds & disperse them after consuming the elaiosome.  Ants obtain nutritional benefits from myrmecochory, valuable in quality rather than in quantity.  Plants can benefit from an increase in dispersal distance, predator avoidance, reduction of kinship among seeds & arrival to favorable microsites.  The interaction can be vital for plants, & is highly dependent on the ant species that collects the diaspore.  A third type of interaction involving seeds & ants is diplochory.  In this case, seeds experience 2 phases of dispersal, usually a combination of a coarse & a fine event.  Ants can participate in diplochory by collecting coarsely dispersed seeds & transporting them to favorable microsites.  Many diplochorous plants offer a reward for frugivores in the form of fruit pulp, as well as a reward for ants in the form of an elaiosome.  In other cases, the seeds can be secondarily dispersed by dyszoochory rather than by myrmecochory.]          [NOTE: S. saevissima is S. invicta or S. richteri in North America.]",

    "abstract": "Questions: 1. Do disturbances by harvester ants (Messor barbarus L.) affect soil properties? 2. Do they alter seed distribution? 3. Do they show a different species composition? 4 Are these changes related to seed size (length and weight)? Location: Mediterranean grasslands in central Spain, near Madrid. Methods: We recorded autumn seed banks and spring vegetation in middens, trunk trails and controls. Soil properties were also measured in middens and controls. The effect of seed weight and length was analysed after transforming data into phylogenetically independent contrasts. Results: Soil under middens is more silty and higher in potassium, organic matter and pH. Seed density and seed bank species richness increased greatly in middens, while vegetation species richness was significantly lower in comparison to control samples. Abundance changes in this disturbance type were positively correlated with seed weight, both in seed bank and vegetation. In contrast, we only detected a slight increase in bare ground on foraging trunk trails, with no clear effects on seed bank and vegetation composition. Conclusions: Midden development is a mechanism that generates heterogeneity which favours the survival of certain large-seeded species mainly predated by ants in Mediterranean grasslands. This effect may partially neutralize the dominance of small seeded species expected from the seed predation process.

We described the early stages of U. spitzi, and used field observations and experiments to investigate the defensive strategies of caterpillars against predatory ants. Larvae pass through five instars and pupation occurs inside larval leaf shelters. Ant-exclusion experiments revealed that the presence of ants did not affect significantly caterpillar survival. Predation experiments showed that vulnerability to ant predation decreased with increase in larval size.

We found that the mutualist ant more than doubled tree relative growth rates & increased odds of survival.  However, host tree size & density of conspecific neighbors modified the effect of the ant.  Smaller trees hosting the mutualist ant consistently grew faster when surrounded by higher densities of conspecifics, suggesting that the benefit to the tree outweighs any negative effects of high conspecific densities.  Moreover, our findings suggest that the benefit afforded by the ant diminishes with plant age & also depends on the density of conspecific neighbors.

Figs participate in an obligate mutualism in that figs are dependent on agaonid fig wasps for pollination and the wasps are dependent on fig ovules for brood sites. Ants are common insect predators and abundant in tropical forests. Ants have been recorded on approximately 11% of fig species, including all six subgenera, and often affect the fig-fig pollinator interaction through their predation of either pollinating and parasitic wasps. On monoecious figs, ants are often associated with hemipterans, whereas in dioecious figs ants predominantly prey on fig wasps. A few fig species are true myrmecophytes, with domatia or food rewards for ants, and in at least one species this is linked to predation of parasitic fig wasps. Ants also play a role in dispersal of fig seeds and may be particularly important for hemi-epiphytic species, which require high quality establishment microsites in the canopy. The intersection between the fig-fig pollinator and ant-plant systems promises to provide fertile ground for understanding mutualistic interactions within the context of complex interaction networks.",

    "abstract": "1. Mutualistic interactions are characterized by conditional outcomes that depend on both the biotic and the abiotic context. However, limited information is available on the factors that affect the strength of ant-plant interactions among sympatric congeneric species.  2. We compared the benefits gained from attracting ants via extrafloral nectaries - i.e. lowered herbivory and increased seed set - of three co-occurring varieties in the Chamaecrista desvauxii complex (Leguminosae) in a cerrado area in Uberl\u201andia, Brazil. Using whole-individual exclusion experiments, we tested the hypotheses (i) that the relative strength of those benefits is higher in the variety with the largest extrafloral nectaries and (ii) that those benefits are conditional on the presence of predispersal seed predators.  3. Extrafloral nectaries are larger, produce more nectar and attract more ants in var. brevipes than in the other two varieties included in the study. Var. modesta has intermediate-sized nectaries, while a third, undescribed variety has small nectaries, and both attract relatively few ants.  4. For var. brevipes, extrafloral nectary (EFN) removal significantly increased folivory and attack on fruits by sucking insects, decreasing the relative number of flowers, fruits and seeds produced per individual. For the other two varieties, in contrast, ant effects were reduced, and ants did not significantly improve reproductive success. In addition, effects of EFN removal were less pronounced or absent when seed predators were excluded from fruits of var. brevipes.  5. Synthesis.

    "abstract": "*[To assess which types of plant species possess ant-repelling floral traits, I carried out a survey of 49 Neotropical plant species.  Around a third of these species were repellent to the common generalist ant Camponotus novograndensis (Formicinae). This repellence was positively correlated with large nectar volumes within individual flowers.  It appears that there has been selection for floral ant-repellence as a defence against ant thieves in plant species that invest in large volumes of nectar.  In some cases these repellent traits were effective against a wide range of ant species.  However, in no plant species were predacious ants particularly repelled, indicating that there may be little selective pressure on non-ant-plants to defend potential pollinators from aggressive ants.  To investigate the importance of coevolution in determining the effectiveness of ant-repellents, a small but diverse range of Mediterranean plant species were tested with the invasive nectar thieving ant Linepithema humile (Dolichoderinae) and the native but non-nectar thieving ant Messor bouvieri (Myrmicinae).  Responses of both ant species to floral traits were very similar.  The ability of some plants to restrict access to ant species with which they have no evolutionary history may help to reduce the impact invasive species, as nectar thieves, have on plant-pollinator interactions.  It is reported that flowers recently visited by bees & hoverflies may be rejected for a period of time by subsequent bee visitors through the detection of scent-marks.  Nectar-thieving ants could potentially influence the foraging decisions of bees in a similar way if they come to associate ant trail pheromones or footprint hydrocarbons with poor reward levels.  However, my empirical work found no differences were found in bee visitation behaviour between flowers of Digitalis pupurea (Plantaginaceae), Bupleurum fruticosum (Apiaceae) or Brassica juncea (Brassicaceae) that had been in contact with ants & control flowers.  Ant-attendance at flowers of these species may not reduce reward levels sufficiently to make it worthwhile for bees to incorporate ant scent-marks into foraging decisions.]           Messor bouvieri incorrectly cited as a Myrmecinae, it is actually a Myrmicinae.",

They reflect several neutral and niche\u0010based mechanisms related to plant\u0013animal interactions. 2. However, the strength with which these processes influence community structure depends on functional traits that influence the interactions between mutualistic partners. In mutualisms involving plants and ants, nectar is the most common reward, and traits such as quantity and quality can affect ant species' responses by influencing their recruitment rates and aggressiveness. 3. In this study, nectar traits that mediate ant\u0013plant defensive mutualisms were manipulated to test whether resource quantity and quality affect the structure of ant\u0013plant interaction networks. A downscaling approach was used to investigate the interaction network between ant species and individual plants of the extrafloral nectary\u0010bearing terrestrial orchid Epidendrum secundum. 4. We found a short\u0010term reorganization of the ant assemblage that caused the interaction networks to become more specialised and modular in response to a more rewarding nectar gradient. Furthermore, the ant species tended to narrow their foraging range by limiting their associations to one or a few individual plants. 5. This study shows that ant species' responses to variable resource traits play an important role in the structure of the ant\u0013plant interaction network. We suggest that more rewarding nectar enhanced aggressiveness and a massive recruitment of some ant species, leading to lower niche overlap and thus a less connected and more specialised network.",

    "abstract": "Indirect interactions are pivotal in the evolution of interacting species and the assembly of populations and communities. Nevertheless, despite recently being investigated in plant\u0013animal mutualism at the community level, indirect interactions have not been studied in resource-mediated mutualisms involving plant individuals that share different animal species as partners within a population (i.e., individual-based networks). Here, we analyzed an individual-based ant\u0013plant network to evaluate how resource properties affect indirect interaction patterns and how changes in indirect links leave imprints in the network across multiple levels of network organization. Using complementary analytical approaches, we described the patterns of indirect interactions at the micro-, meso-, and macro-scale. We predicted that plants offering intermediate levels of nectar quantity and quality interact with more diverse ant assemblages. The increased number of ant species would cause a higher potential for indirect interactions in all scales evaluated. We found that nectar properties modified patterns of indirect interactions of plant individuals that share mutualistic partners, leaving imprints across different network scales. To our knowledge, this is the first study tracking indirect interactions in multiple scales within an individual-based network. We show that functional traits of interacting species, such as nectar properties, may lead to changes in indirect interactions, which could be tracked across different levels of the network organization evaluated.          *[Considering all treatments, 301 interactions among 26 E. secundum individuals & 14 ant species were recorded.]          *[No specific ants mentioned.]",

ENNs have been frequently reported within the 'xeric clade' of Bromeliaceae, but their occurrence in other groups of bromeliads is largely unexplored, especially considering their position, secretory activity and structure. After observing the presence of ants constantly patrolling the inflorescences of Pitcairnia burchellii Mez, we searched for the presence, secretory activity, and structure of ENNs in this species. We also provide a brief review of the occurrence ENNs in Bromeliaceae. The distribution of nectaries was assessed using ant-exclusion experiments, while structural analysis was performed using standard methods for light and scanning electron microscopy. The presence of sugars in the secretion was assessed by thin-layer chromatography and glucose strip tests. Nectaries in P. burchelli are non-structured glands on the adaxial surface of floral bracts and sepals. Bracts and sepals are distinct spatial units that act over time in the same strategy of floral bud protection. Literature data reveals that ENNs might be more common within Bromeliaceae than previously considered, comprising a homoplastic feature in the family. Future perspectives and evolutionary and taxonomic implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) includes about 280 species with a palaeotropic distribution. The genus not only comprises some of the most prominent pioneer tree species in Southeast Asian lowland dipterocarp forests, it also exhibits a substantial radiation of ant-plant (myrmecophytes). Obligate ant-plant mutualisms are formed by about 30 Macaranga species and 13 ant species of the genera Crematogaster or Camponotus. To improve our understanding of the co-evolution of the ants and their host plants, we aim at reconstructing comparative organellar phylogeographies of both partners across their distributional range. Preliminary evidence indicated that chloroplast DNA introgression among closely related Macaranga species might occur. We therefore constructed a comprehensive chloroplast genealogy based on DNA sequence data from the noncoding ccmp2, ccmp6, and atpB-rbcL regions for 144 individuals from 41 Macaranga species, covering all major evolutionary lineages within the three sections that contain myrmecophytes. A total of 88 chloroplast haplotypes were identified, and grouped into a statistical parsimony network that clearly distinguished sections and well-defined subsectional groups. Within these groups, the arrangement of haplotypes followed geographical rather than taxonomical criteria. Thus, up to six chloroplast haplotypes were found within single species, and up to seven species shared a single haplotype. The spatial distribution of the chloroplast types revealed several dispersals between the Malay Peninsula and Borneo, and a deep split between Sabah and the remainder of Borneo. Our large-scale chloroplast genealogy highlights the complex history of migration, hybridization, and speciation in the myrmecophytes of the genus Macaranga. It will serve as a guideline for adequate sampling and data interpretation in phylogeographic studies of individual Macaranga species and species groups.",

    "abstract": "Community genetics aims to understand the effects of intraspecific genetic variation on community composition and diversity, thereby connecting community ecology with evolutionary biology. Thus far, research has shown that plant genetics can underlie variation in the composition of associated communities (e.g., insects, lichen and endophytes), and those communities can therefore be considered as extended phenotypes. This work, however, has been conducted primarily at the plant genotype level and has not identified the key underlying genes. To address this gap, we used genome\u0010wide association mapping with a population of 445 aspen (Populus tremuloides) genets to identify the genes governing variation in plant traits (defence chemistry, bud phenology, leaf morphology, growth) and insect community composition. We found 49 significant SNP associations in 13 Populus genes that are correlated with chemical defence compounds and insect community traits. Most notably, we identified an early nodulin\u0010like protein that was associated with insect community diversity and the abundance of interacting foundation species (ants and aphids). These findings support the concept that particular plant traits are the mechanistic link between plant genes and the composition of associated insect communities. In putting the \u001cgenes\u001d into \u001cgenes to ecosystems ecology\u001d, this work enhances understanding of the molecular genetic mechanisms that underlie plant\u0013insect associations and the consequences thereof for the structure of ecological communities.",

Ants are attracted by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), situated near flowers, and may interfere with the efficiency and behaviour of pollinators. We tested the hypothesis that the impacts of ant-pollinator interactions in plant-pollinator systems are dependent on (1) the seasonal activity of EFNs, which increase ant abundance closer to flowers; (2) consequently, an ant effect, where ants decrease the temporal niche overlap of bees due to predator avoidance; and (3) ant density, where higher densities may negatively affect plant-pollinator interactions and plant performance. We studied two ant-plant-pollinator systems based on Banisteriopsis campestris and Banisteriopsis malifolia plant species. The periods of high ant abundance coincided with plant species blooming. The presence of ants around flowers reduced the visitation rates of the smaller bees and the temporal niche overlap between bee species was not higher than randomly expected when ants had free access. Additionally, we observed variable ant effects on fruit set and duration of bee visits to both Malpighiaceae species when ant density was experimentally kept constant on branches, especially on B. campestris. Our goal was to show the dual role of ant density effects, especially because the different outcomes are not commonly observed in the same plant species. We believe that reduced temporal niche overlap between floral visitors due to ant presence provides an opportunity for smaller bees to improve compatible pollination behaviour. Additionally, we concluded that ant density had variable effects on floral visitor behaviours and plant reproductive performance.",

Here, we examined the influence of foliar trichomes and ants on herbivory in the Neotropical ant-plant Tococa guianensis. We performed a feeding preference test and a field experiment in which we manipulated the presence of ants and trichomes in three distinct populations of T. guianensis; two associated with obligate mutualistic ants and one associated with opportunistic ants. We found that both mutualistic ants and leaf trichomes act as mechanisms of defense against herbivores in T. guianensis. However, the relative importance of each of these two mechanisms was context dependent. The magnitude of the effect of trichomes (as measured by the effect size) was relatively low and varied little among plant populations. The effect of ants on foliar herbivory was up to seven times stronger than the effect of the trichomes. Nevertheless, because the magnitude of ant effects was spatially variable - depending on whether mutualistic ants were present or not, and probably also on the local abundance of herbivores - the relative contribution of ants and trichomes for plant defense was also spatially variable. These findings indicate that mechanical defenses (leaf trichomes) alone cannot replace the biotic defenses of T. guianensis. However, trichomes can play a comparatively more important role in plant defense at times or places where mutualistic ants are not present.",

Ant recruitment was also lower to continuously wetted pitchers.  Our experimental data fit a simple model that predicts that intermittent, wetness-based trap activation should allow safe access for 'scout' ants under dry conditions, thereby promoting recruitment & ultimately higher prey numbers.  The peristome trapping mechanism may therefore represent an adaptation for capturing ants.]",

    "abstract": "*[We present an encompassing mechanism for a rapid, repeatable, passive-dynamic motion used by a carnivorous pitcher plant to catch prey.  Nepenthes gracilis uses the impact of rain drops to catapult insects from the underside of the canopy-like pitcher lid into the fluid-filled trap below.  High-speed video & laser vibrometry revealed that the lid acts as a torsional spring system, driven by rain drops.  During the initial downstroke, the tip of the lid reached peak velocities similar to fast animal motions & an order of magnitude faster than the snap traps of Venus flytraps & catapulting tentacles of the sundew Drosera glanduligera.  In contrast to these active movements, the N. gracilis lid oscillation requires neither mechanical preloading nor metabolic energy, & its repeatability is only limited by the intensity & duration of rainfall.  The underside of the lid is coated with friction-reducing wax crystals, making insects more vulnerable to perturbations.  We show that the trapping success of N. gracilis relies on the combination of material stiffness adapted for momentum transfer & the anti-adhesive properties of the wax crystal surface.  The impact-driven oscillation of the N. gracilis lid represents a new kind of rapid plant movement with adaptive function.]",

An ant exclusion experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of ant presence on fruit production.  The petals of M. tococa have a secretory epidermis that produces sugary compounds.  Nectar production occurred during the floral bud stage & attracted 17 species of non-obligate ants (i.e. have a facultative association with ant-plants).  Ants foraged only on floral buds, & thus did not affect the activity of pollinators in the neighboring open flowers.  The presence of ants in the inflorescences increased fruit production by 15%.  To our knowledge, the production of extranuptial nectar in the reproductive structures of a myrmecophyte is very rare, with few records in the literature.

Plant phenology affected ant richness & abundance in different ways.  Plants with young leaves possessed higher ant richness in the rainy season, but in the dry season, ant abundance was higher on plants possessing old leaves or flowers.

The number of plant partners also increased with the size & age of the ant garden.  No specific plant-ant association was ever found in the ant gardens examined.  In 50% of the ant gardens studied, whatever the environment, there were 2 different ant partners per garden.  Seven categories of plant-ant associations were recognized.

In the foliar nectary, the histological specialization goes through a three-zoned superposed structure (Alchornea) and an increase of external zone cells. Then, by central invagination (Inga), we are coming to an interlocked and inner structure (Laguncularia). In Anthocleista, adult leaf nectaries have an original inner development as ramified galleries (Pl. II, fig. 9-12). The myrmecophytic plants Acacia collinsii (Pl.

The ants inhabit the internodes of the tree and feed on nutritive bodies or m\u00b8llerian bodies.  These multicellular corpuscles are produced on the abaxial face of the base of the petiole.  This region is covered with a velutinous mat of multicellular, but uniseried trichomes called trichilium.  The production activity of m\u00b8llerian bodies & the activity of the ants are synchronous, 3 hours before the sundown.  A Phycitinae caterpillar may occupy the Cecropia internodes & consumes m\u00b8llerian bodies exclusively.  A fungus, Fusarium moniliforme, grows on the trichilium in the absence of ants.  The distribution of Cecropia obtusa is homogeneous in space & time but its growth is under control of topographic, edaphic, & climatic factors.  The comparison between trees occupied by ants & unoccupied ones shows that these last ones grow less quickly & that the m\u00b8llerian production is smaller.  Cecropia trees cultivated in greenhouse show the same behavior than unoccupied ones in the field with, however, a greater production rate of m\u00b8llerian bodies.  When caterpillars inhabit the plant the production of m\u00b8llerian bodies is higher than in the case of unoccupied Cecropia.  The part of ants & caterpillars in the plant growth & m\u00b8llerian bodies production is discussed.  The partial chemical analysis of food bodies shows a clear dominance of glycogen which add simple sugars, lipids, proteins, & C & E vitamins.  The differences between the guiana food bodies & m\u00b8llerian bodies producted in greenhouse are discussed.]",

For this, we classified arthropods associated with Heliconia aurantiaca herbs into broad trophic guilds (omnivores, herbivores, predators) & assessed the topological structure of intrapopulation plant-arthropod networks in fragments & continuous forests.  Habitat type influenced arthropod species abundance, diversity, & composition with greater abundance in fragments, but greater diversity in continuous forest.  According to trophic guilds, coleopteran herbivores were more abundant in continuous forest & overall omnivores in fragments.  Continuous forest showed a greater diversity of interactions than fragments.  Only in fragments, however, did the arthropod community associated with H aurantiaca show a nested structure, suggesting novel and/or opportunistic host-arthropod associations.  Plants, omnivores, & predators contributed more to nestedness than herbivores.  Heliconia-arthropod network properties do not appear to be maintained in fragments mainly caused by the decrease of herbivores.]",

Ant nest debris within bulb chambers contains considerable nigrogenous material, but nitrogen recovered from this debris is not directly available to seedlings of Aechmea pubescens Baker when provided as a nitrogen sourcein sterile culture.  Although considerable nitrogen in bulb chambers is water soluble, assay for uric acid was negative while tests for amino nitrogen & reactivity to Folin-Ciocalteu reagent gave only weak positive results.  Chromatographic analysis of soluble nitrogen extracts revealed at least 3 ninhydrin-positive compounds.  Internal bulb surfaces possess trichome-enhanced permeability, & foliar-absorbed calcium is translocated throughout the plant body.

We presented evidence of competitive and facilitative plant-plant conspecific and heterospecific interactions, and plant-soil-microbes interactions in relation to the abiotic environment at the fine patch-scale. We also showed evidence of animal-animal interactions and plant-animal interactions at the community scale through study cases involving both native and introduced herbivores. Moreover, we identified bottom-up and top-down forces governing the interactions between granivores (birds, ants, and small mammals) and seed availability/production at the community scale. At the landscape scale, we discussed feedbacks between domestic grazers and the spatial patterns of resources and their interrelationships with processes occurring at other scales. We concluded that research has steadily increased during the last 6 years but knowledge on biological interactions in the Monte desert is still scarce, particularly at a landscape scale.",

Little is known about how workers keep their outside territory clear of diseases. We investigated the interactions between Azteca chartifex ants, their associated bacteria and bacteria on the phyllosphere of Byrsonima sericea trees, comparing plants patrolled and not by the ants. The hypothesis is that bacteria associated with the worker\u0019s exoskeleton may outcompete the leaf bacteria. Culturable bacteria were isolated from ants, from the main and satellite nests, and from phyllosphere of B. sericea taken from trees that had A. chartifex nests and from trees without nests. The isolates were grouped by Gram guilds and identified at the genus level. There was a higher percentage of Gram-negative isolates in the ants and on the leaves patrolled by them. There was a higher growth rate of ant bacteria from the main nest compared to those found in ants from the satellite nests. The most representative genus among ant isolates was Enterobacter, also found on leaves patrolled by ants. Under favourable in vitro conditions, A. chartifex Gram-negative bacteria outcompete leaf bacteria by overgrowth, showing a greater competition capacity over the Gram-positive bacteria from leaves with no previous interaction with ants in the field. It was demonstrated that ants carry bacteria capable of outcompeting exogenous bacteria associated with their outside territory. The leaf microbiota of a patrolled tree could be shaped by the ant microbiota, suggesting that large ant colonies may have a key role in structuring canopy plant\u0013microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Many plants use induced defenses to reduce the costs of antiherbivore defense. These plants invest energy in growth when herbivores are absent but shunt energy to defense when herbivores are present. In contrast, constitutive defenses are expressed continuously regardless of herbivore presence. Induction has been widely documented in temperate plants but has not been reported from tropical plants. Most tropical plants have higher, more constant herbivore pressure than temperate plants. In this situation, it is hypothesized that constitutive defenses rather than induced defense would be favored. Using natural herbivores of four species of Inga saplings on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, herbivore presence was crossed with ant presence to determine their effects on extrafloral nectar production. Analysis of nectar samples revealed that Inga species do not induce nectar production in response to herbivores. This result is not due to an inability of the plants to respond, as the plants in this study increased nectar production in response to light and ant presence. Contrary to most induction experiments with temperate ecosystem plants, these results demonstrate that tropical plants do not induce one type of defense, and they suggest that the most adaptive defense strategies are different for the two ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "AIM: Pleistocene climatic oscillations induced range fluctuations in African rain forest organisms and may have shaped species diversification through allopatric speciation events. We compared the spatial genetic structure of two forest species that live in obligate symbiosis and thus must have experienced the same range fluctuations, as a means to discriminate incipient speciation from transient differentiation simply resulting from past divergence. LOCATION: Western central Africa. METHODS: We genotyped 765 individuals of the tree Barteria fistulosa and 605 colonies of its symbiotic ant Tetraponera aethiops at 12 and 13 microsatellite loci, respectively. We compared the spatial genetic structure of the two symbionts by using Bayesian clustering algorithms, isolation\u0010by\u0010distance analyses and clines of synthetic alleles. We used species niche modelling (climatic and soil variables) to investigate ecological variables associated with genetic discontinuities in tree populations. RESULTS: The trees and the ants showed congruent patterns of spatial genetic structure. However, the trees showed a very steep genetic discontinuity between groups north and south of latitude 1\u221e N, which was much weaker in the ants. There was no evidence for effective gene flow between the two tree lineages in contact at the transition zone, despite the presence of a few hybrids. Niche modelling did not predict the occurrence of northern trees south of this genetic transition, and vice versa. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The genetic discontinuity near latitude 1\u221e N is inferred to be a tension zone resulting from reproductive incompatibilities between previously allopatric tree lineages. This tension zone may have stabilized at a climatic transition (between boreal and austral seasonal regimes), and matches patterns of genetic structure previously observed in other forest plant species. Our results illustrate independent speciation between two species that live in specific and obligate symbiosis and suggest that a tension zone may separate lineages of several central African forest plants near the thermal equator.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims Plant defence traits against herbivores incur production costs that are usually difficult to measure. However, estimating these costs is a prerequisite for characterizing the plant defence strategy as a whole. Myrmecophytes are plants that provide symbiotic ants with specialized nesting cavities, called domatia, in exchange for protection against herbivores. In the particular case of stem domatia, production of extra wood seems to be the only associated cost, making this indirect defence trait a particularly suitable model for estimating the cost of defence. Methods Measurements were made of growth pattern and cumulative production cost of domatia over secondary growth in the myrmecophyte Leonardoxa africana subsp. africana, whose internodes display both a solid basal segment and a hollow distal part (the domatium), thus allowing paired comparison of investment in wood. Key Results Previous studies showed that 'overconstruction' of the hollow part of internodes during primary growth is needed for mechanical support. In this study, it is shown that the relationship between the woody cross-sectional area of the solid and hollow parts of internodes is negatively allometric at the beginning of secondary growth and nearly isometric later on. Thus, in hollow stems, the first phase of slow secondary growth compensates for the 'overconstruction' of the ring of wood during primary growth. Moreover, the cumulative production cost of a domatium (estimated as the additional volume of wood required for a hollow stem compared with a solid one) is very high at the beginning of secondary growth and then quickly tends to zero. Conclusions Making domatia incurs high costs early in ontogeny, costs that are then amortized later in development of stems and of individual plants. Characterizing ontogenetic variation of the net cost of this peculiar defence mechanism will help us build more accurate theoretical models of resource allocation in myrmecophytes.",

Due to their strong demand on carbohydrate-rich resources, they often exploit floral nectar of native Hawaiian plant species with largely unknown consequences for the plants' reproduction.  We examined effects of flower-visiting invasive ants on reproduction of the endemic shrub Vaccinium reticulatum (Ericaceae) in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park.  Ant densities in flowers were high & floral nectar was excessively exploited, which may lead to a reduced visitation rate of pollinators.  However, the ants presence on flowers strongly reduced flower parasitism by caterpillars of the introduced plume moth Stenoptilodes littoralis & decreased the loss of flowers & buds.  This is the first documented mutualism between invasive ants & an endemic plant species in Hawai'i.  Developed fruits of this partly self-incompatible plant, bore relatively low proportions of viable seeds, irrespective of the experimentally controlled visitor spectrum of the flowers.  This may indicate that ants do not function as pollinators & that effective pollinators are scant or absent.]",

Eighteen floral nectars, 16 extrafloral nectars, 2 wound sap,& 4 homopteran honeydew sources were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography.  Wounds comprised flower abscission scars on Normanbya normanbyi L. H. Bailey & bitemarks on Cardwellia sublimis F. Muell., where ants were actively involved in wounding.  Discriminant analysis was performed to model differences between food sources in sugar & amino acid concentration and composition.  All characteristics varied significantly among plant species.  Honeydew contained a broader spectrum of sugars (including melezitose, raffinose, melibiose, lactose, & maltose) than nectar (sucrose, glucose, fructose), but certain extrafloral nectars had similar amino acid profiles, which like honeydew sources, were often monopolized by ants.  Most common amino acids across the sources were proline, alanine, & threonine among 17 alpha-amino acids identified.  Interspecific variability concealed characteristic differences in sugar & amino acid parameters between nectar, honeydew, & wound sap across all plants, but these types differed significantly when found on the same plant.  Among all sources studied, only a few flower nectars were naturally not consumed by ants & they were significantly less attended than sugar controls in feeding trials.  These nectars did not differ in sugars & amino acids from ant-attended flower nectars, suggesting the activity of repellents.  Apart from these exceptions, variability in amino acids & carbohydrates is proposed to play a key role in ant preferences and nutrition.]",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant interactions in the canopy of a lowland Amazonian rainforest of the upper Orinoco, Venezuela, were studied using a modified commercial crane on rails (Surumoni project). Our observations show a strong correlation between plant sap exudates and both abundance of ants and co-occurrence of ant species in tree canopies. Two types of plant sap sources were compared: extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and honeydew secretions by homopterans. EFNs were a frequent food source for ants on epiphytes (Philodendron spp., Araceae) and lianas (Dioclea, Fabaceae), but rare on canopy trees in the study area, whereas the majority of trees were host to aggregations of homopterans tended by honeydew-seeking ants (on 62% of the trees examined). These aggregations rarely occurred on epiphytes. Baited ant traps were installed on plants with EFNs and in the crowns of trees from three common genera, including trees with and without ant-tended homopterans: Goupia glabra (Celastraceae), Vochysia spp. (Vochysiaceae), and Xylopia spp. (Annonaceae). The number of ant workers per trap was significantly higher on plants offering one of the two plant sap sources than on trees without such resources. Extrafloral nectaries were used by a much broader spectrum of ant species and genera than honeydew, and co-occurrence of ant species (in traps) was significantly higher on plants bearing EFNs than on trees. Homopteran honeydew (Coccidae and Membracidae), on the other hand, was mostly monopolised by a single ant colony per tree. Homopteran-tending ants were generally among the most dominant ants in the canopy. The most prominent genera were Azteca, Dolichoderus (both Dolichoderinae), Cephalotes, Pheidole, Crematogaster (all Myrmicinae), and Ectatomma (Ponerinae). Potential preferences were recorded between ant and homopteran species, and also between ant-homopteran associations and tree genera. We hypothesize that the high availability of homopteran honeydew provides a key resource for ant mosaics, where dominant ant colonies and species maintain mutually exclusive territories on trees. In turn, we propose that for nourishment of numerous ants of lower competitive capacity, Philodendron and other sources of EFNs might be particularly important.",

It is, however, questionable whether this ant\u0013plant interaction is truly mutualistic, since some ant partners do not show a clear-cut fitness gain and may cease the harvesting of myrmecochorous seeds over time. In particular, the role of ant larvae as potential consumers of seed elaiosomes is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated how the number of larvae influences the foraging responses of the red ant Myrmica rubra to Viola odorata myrmecochorous seeds and to Drosophila melanogaster prey. Ant workers retrieved less elaiosome-bearing seeds than prey and the harvesting of seeds remained low, even in the presence of larvae. Furthermore, while the ant colonies continued to collect prey over successive foraging events, the retrieval of myrmecochorous seeds decreased, most particularly in colonies containing a large number of larvae. Brood exposure to diaspores also declined, with very few larvae coming into contact with seeds. Our results suggest that the role of larvae as elaiosome consumers should be reconsidered and that larvae may provide workers with cues about the poor palatability of V. odorata diaspores, thereby altering the stability of this ant\u0013plant interaction.",

Iridomyrmex humilis, the Argentine ant, has recently invaded areas of fynbos and displaced the dominant native ants in being slower to discover the seeds (morphologically achenes) of ant-dispersed Mimetes cucullatus (Proteaceae), in moving them shorter diistances, and in failing to store them in nests below the soil.  seeds left on the soil surface were eaten by vertebrate and invertebarte predators. To study seedling emergence, seed depots were established and the the area was burned. Emergence was 35.3% in sites not infested by Iridomyrmex and 0.7% in infested sites.  Seedlings in naturally occurring stands of M. cucullatus burnt in the same fire were widely distributed in non-infested sites, but were fewer and were confined within the canopy radius in infested sites. We suggest that continued invasion of fynbos by Iridomyrmex may eventually lead to extinction of many rare, endemic Cape Proteaceae by slow and subtle attrition of seed reserves.",

However, 47 out of 50 individuals of the largest visitor dropped into the pitchers of 5 plants were attacked by ants & the capture rate of the same pitchers deprived of their ambush hunting ants decreased 3-fold.  We then tested whether ants participated in plant's digestion.  We showed in a 15-d long experiment that ants fed on prey & returned it in pieces in 7 out of 8 pitchers.  The 40 prey deposited in ant-deprived pitchers remained intact indicating a weak digestive power of the fluid confirmed to be only weakly acidic.

    "abstract": "Interactions between ants and plants are classic examples of cooperation between individuals of different species. Usually, plants provide shelter or food for ants and in turn are defended against herbivores by their insect allies. To coordinate attacks, ants use multi-modal alarm signals consisting of vibrational and chemical components. This can also be observed in Borneo, where two Camponotus species inhabit the ocreas (diverging, tubular leaf sheaths) of the rattan palm Korthalsia robusta. When ants are disturbed, they beat or scratch mandibles and abdomens on the plant surface resulting in loud rustling sounds. To describe the characteristics of these signals, we recorded them with a Laser-Doppler-vibrometer in the field. Analyses of temporal patterns and dominant frequency revealed that the signals of the two species differ fundamentally. To assess transmission characteristics of the rattan palm, we conducted experiments under controlled lab-conditions. We show that the ocrea is an adequate structure for converting airborne sound into substrate vibrations, acting as a mediator between these two modalities. We hypothesize that the ants' vibratory signal has multiple functions, with the substrate-borne component used as an alarm signal for conspecifics, and the airborne component acting as vibro-acoustic aposematism against predators or herbivores to protect the host plant.",

In the nest the larvae are fed with the lipid-rich aril, and the viable seed is discarded. Benefits from secondary seed dispersal by ants are well documented for tropical plants, but benefits to ants from consuming vertebrate-dispersed diaspores are uncertain. Twelve captive colonies of O. chelifer were used to investigate the effect of aril consumption on larval development. Treatment colonies were supplemented with 1 g of C. canjerana arils, whereas control colonies were supplemented with 1 g of synthetic diet. Egg and larval production did not differ between experimental colonies after 5 mo. Aril-fed larvae, however, grew 3.5 times larger than those in control colonies. Essential fatty acids in the arils possibly account for improved larval development. Consumption of lipid-rich arils may be critical under scarcity of arthropod prey. Improved larval development through aril consumption confirms that this ant-seed interaction is facultatively mutualistic. This result is meaningful given the predominantly carnivorous diet of O. chelifer, and the generalized nature of ant-seed/fruit interactions in tropical forests. Whether or not benefits to larvae translate into significant gains for ant colonies is uncertain.",

We tested the hypothesis that interactions are more frequent, resulting in greater seedling establishment at the site with harsher abiotic and biotic conditions. Both ant species removed fruits frequently and have a positive effect on seedling establishment in all study areas, but fruit removal did not differ among areas, while seedling establishment was more pronounced at the site with stressful abiotic conditions. The two ant species differed in important aspects of their seed dispersal services, including the propensity to interact with seeds. As a result, both the species of ant and abiotic conditions interact at the scale of 2\tkm to determine the fate of seeds interacting with ants, thus creating a mosaic of outcomes with variable benefits to plants.",

    "abstract": "The microhabitat in which plants grow affects the outcome of their interactions with animals, particularly non-specialist consumers. Nevertheless, as most research on this topic has dealt with either mutualists or antagonists, little is known about the indirect effects of plant microhabitats on the outcome of tripartite interactions involving plants and both mutualists (e.g. seed dispersers) and antagonists (e.g. granivores). During three consecutive years, we analysed small-scale variations in the interaction of a perennial myrmecochore, Helleborus foetidus, with its seed dispersers and consumers as a function of the intensity of plant cover. Most seeds were released during the day and were rapidly removed by ants. Nevertheless, the proportion of ant-removed seeds was higher for plants located in open microhabitats than for plants surrounded by dense vegetation and rocky cover. Ant sampling revealed that seed removers were equally abundant, irrespective of the level of cover. By contrast, a few tiny ant species that feed on the reward without transporting the seeds were more abundant in highly covered microhabitats, irrespective of hellebore diaspore availability. These \"cheaters\" decrease the chance of removal by removers and increase the probability of seeds remaining on the ground until night, when granivore mice Apodemus sylvaticus become active. Mice also preferred foraging in covered microhabitats, where they consumed a larger proportion of seeds. Therefore, the density of cover indirectly increased seed predation risk by attracting more seed predators and cheater ants that contribute to increase seed availability for seed predators. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the indirect effects of plant microhabitat on their dispersal success. They highlight the indirect effect of cheaters that are likely to interfere in mutualisms and may lead to their collapse unless external factors such as spatio-temporal heterogeneity in seed availability constrain their effect.",

In theory, if the animals are polyphagous, the availability of alternative food resource other than the diaspore itself may influence its dispersal and survival. We used the myrmecochore Helleborus foetidus L. (Ranunculaceae), the seeds of which are attached to a lipid-rich elaiosome that is attractive to ants, as a model system to investigate (1) whether alternative foods that are present along with the plant affect ant foraging behavior and diaspore removal and (2) whether food availability in an ant nest affects seed predation and germination. In a field experiment, artificial diaspore depots were offered together with either sugar, insect corpses, seed, or no food (control). Contrary to the prediction that ants would rather concentrate their foraging effort on the highly rewarding alternative foods only, many workers, attracted by the sugar, switched to the hellebore diaspores, which significantly enhanced removal rate. Results obtained in the laboratory further indicated that the larvae of Aphaenogaster iberica (a major seed disperser) predated more on the H. foetidus embryos when no alternative food was available. This, in turn, slightly reduced seed germination. Overall, these results shed light, for the first time, on the potential indirect effects of alternative resources on the fate of diaspores adapted for ant dispersal.",

Coexistence in this system has been explained by trade\u0010offs in the ability of the ant associates to compete with each other for occupied trees versus the ability to colonize unoccupied trees. We seek to understand the proximal reasons for how and why the ant species vary in competitive or colonizing abilities, which are largely unknown. In this study, we use RADseq\u0010derived SNPs to identify relatedness of workers in colonies to test the hypothesis that competitively dominant ants reach large colony sizes due to polygyny, that is, the presence of multiple egg\u0010laying queens in a single colony. We find that variation in polygyny is not associated with competitive ability; in fact, the most dominant species, unexpectedly, showed little evidence of polygyny. We also use these markers to investigate variation in mating behavior among the ant species and find that different species vary in the number of males fathering the offspring of each colony. Finally, we show that the nature of polygyny varies between the two commonly polygynous species, Crematogaster mimosae and Tetraponera penzigi: in C. mimosae, queens in the same colony are often related, while this is not the case for T. penzigi. These results shed light on factors influencing the evolution of species coexistence in an ant\u0010plant mutualism, as well as demonstrating the effectiveness of RADseq\u0010derived SNPs for parentage analysis.

Invasive species may prove particularly suitable models for investigating this relationship as many are dependent on finding new partners for successful establishment. We conducted field-based experiments testing whether a native tree facilitates the successful survival of the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), through unfavorable winter conditions in the southeastern United States. We found Argentine ant nests aggregated around the native loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L., during the winter months. The bark of this tree absorbed enough radiant solar energy to reach temperatures suitable for Argentine ant foraging even when ambient temperatures should have curtailed all foraging. Conversely, foraging ceased when the trunk was shaded. The sun-warmed bark of this tree gave the Argentine ant access to a stable honeydew resource. Argentine ants were not found on or near deciduous trees even though bark temperatures were warm enough to permit Argentine ant foraging on cold winter days. Augmenting deciduous trees with sucrose water through the winter months lead to Argentine ant nests remaining at their base and Argentine ants foraging on the tree. The Argentine ant requires both foraging opportunity and a reliable winter food source to survive through unfavorable winter conditions in the southeastern United States. The loblolly pine provided both of these requirements extending the realized niche of Argentine ants beyond its fundamental niche.",

Trophic overlap was greater during the dry season than the green season. In contrast, temporal overlap was greater during the green season than the dry season. The most common flower-visiting ant (Camponotus blandus) exhibited season specific trophic and temporal niches. Flower-visiting ants exhibited seasonal complementarity, but within seasons species exhibited both trophic and temporal overlap, suggesting that competition for floral resources is not a strong structuring force in this guild.",

Such patrolling can be inefficient, however, because herbivore activity is spatio-temporally unpredictable. It has been proposed that rapid and efficient systems of communication between ants and plants, such as volatile compounds released following herbivory, both elicit defensive responses and direct workers to sites of herbivore activity. We performed bioassays in which we challenged colonies of two Amazonian plant-ants, Azteca sp. and Pheidole minutula, with extracts of leaf tissue from (1) their respective host-plant species (Tococa bullifera and Maieta guianensis, both Melastomataceae), (2) sympatric ant-plants from the Melastomataceae, and (3) two sympatric but non-myrmecophytic Melastomataceae. We found that ants of both species responded dramatically to host-plant extracts, and that these responses are greater than those to sympatric myrmecophytes. Azteca sp. also responded to non-myrmecophytes with an intensity similar to that of sympatric ant-plants. By contrast, the response of P. minutula to any non-myrmecophytic extracts was limited. These differences may be driven in part by interspecific differences in nesting behavior; although P. minutula only nests in host plants, Azteca sp. will establish carton satellite nests on nearby plants. We hypothesize that Azteca sp. must therefore recognize and defend a wider array of species than P. minutula.",

    "abstract": "Mutualisms play a central role in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Because many mutualisms have strong demographic effects, interspecific variation in partner quality could have important consequences for population dynamics. Nevertheless, few studies have quantified how a mutualist partner influences population growth rates, and still fewer have compared the demographic impacts of multiple partner species. We used integral projection models parameterized with three years of census data to compare the demographic effects of two ant species, Crematogaster laevis and Pheidole minutula, on populations of the Amazonian ant plant Maieta guianensis. Estimated population growth rates were positive (i.e., gamma > 1) for all ant-plant combinations. However, populations with only Pheidole minutula had the highest asymptotic growth rate (gamma = 1.23), followed by those colonized by Crematogaster laevis (gamma = 1.16), and in which the partner ant alternated between C. laevis and P. minutula at least once during our study (gamma = 1.15). Our results indicate that the short\u0010term superiority of a mutualist partner (in this system, P. minutula is a better defender of plants against herbivores than C. laevis) can have long\u0010term demographic consequences. Furthermore, the demographic effects of switching among alternative partners appear to be context dependent, with no benefits to plants hosting C. laevis but a major cost of switching to plants hosting P. minutula. Our results underscore the importance of expanding the study of mutualisms beyond the study of pair\u0010wise interactions to consider the demographic costs and benefits of interacting with different, and multiple, potential partners.",

In this study we explored the diversity, distribution, & interactions of exudate-gathering ants at 3 different liquid food rewards: nectar from extrafloral nectaries on Croton sarcopetalus & honeydew from the aphids Aphis spiraecola & Dysaphis foeniculus on Eupatorium hookerianum (Asteraceae) & Foeniculum vulgare (Apiaceae) respectively.  For each food reward, we measured ant diversity & performed quantitative & qualitative comparisons among ants associated with the food rewards.  In addition, a linear regression was performed to test for possible associations between aphid & ant abundances in the case of honeydew food rewards.  Eight out of the 23 ant species found fed on both nectar from extrafloral nectaries & honeydew from aphids, 4 of which fed at all food rewards.  Two ant species visited both aphid species & 13 were found exclusively at either one of the food rewards.   Brachymyrmex brevicornis was the most abundant ant species & Pheidole sp.2 had the greatest occurrence.  Both ant species diversity & richness were higher at extrafloral nectaries of C. sarcopetalus.  Regressions showed positive significant association between ants & aphids abundances both on E. hookerianum & F. vulgare.  We can conclude that the 3 liquid food rewards compared here showed modest similarity in their ant fauna.  Furthermore, there was selectiveness of ants towards extrafloral nectaries of C. sarcopetalus, which might be due to food source attributes rather than co-evolutionary factors.]",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions provide essential ecosystem functions that contribute to promoting and maintaining diversity in ecosystems. Understanding if functionally important mutualisms are \u001cresilient\u001d (i.e., able to resist or recover) to anthropogenic disturbance is essential for revealing the capacity for diversity to recover. Animal\u0010mediated seed dispersal supports plant population growth and influences community structure, and disturbance affecting seed dispersal can contribute to low resiliency of plant diversity. Ant-seed dispersal mutualisms are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, as they rely on one to a few high\u0010quality dispersal partners. In North American eastern deciduous forests, ants in the genus Aphaenogaster are \u001ckeystone dispersers\u001d of understory forbs adapted to dispersal by ants (myrmecochores), which make up more than one\u0010third of the understory herbaceous community. The majority of forests within this region have regenerated from previous disturbance in the form of clearing for agriculture. Previous studies have revealed that myrmecochore diversity is not resilient to previous clearing. Here, we ask if seed dispersal mutualisms are resilient to historical forest disturbance and if decreases in mutualistic interactions with partners, Aphaenogaster sp., or increases in antagonistic interactions cause degradation of function. In a large\u0010scale natural experiment (20 sites), we measured seed removal, the abundance of mutualistic partners and other invertebrates interacting with seeds, myrmecochore cover, and diversity, along with ant habitat and forest structure. We found lower and more variable seed removal in secondary forests compared with remnant forests. A path analysis of all forests revealed that the abundance of mutualists was the primary determinant of the variation in seed removal, and that seed damage by antagonists (invasive slugs) negatively affected dispersal and was higher in secondary forests. In a path analysis of remnant forests, the link between mutualist abundance and seed removal was absent, but present in the secondary forest path, suggesting that seed dispersal is more variable and dependent on the mutualist abundance in secondary forests and is stable and high in remnant forests. Our results suggest that functional resilience to disturbance is variable, where seed dispersal is low in some secondary forests and not others. This work provides key insights into the effects of disturbance on mutualistic interactions and how the resilience of critical ecosystem functions impacts the capacity for diversity resiliency.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Food bodies (FBs) are structures that promote mutualism between plants and ants, which help protect them against herbivores. The present study aims to describe the anatomical organization, ultrastructure and chemical composition of the FBs in Hovenia dulcis, which represent the first structures of this type described in Rhamnaceae. METHODS: Leaves in various stages of development were collected and fixed for examination under light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Samples of FBs were subjected to chemical analysis using thin-layer chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance of 1H and 13C. KEY RESULTS: The FBs vary from globose to conical and are restricted to the abaxial leaf surface, having a mixed origin, including epidermis and parenchyma. The FB epidermis is uniseriate, slightly pilose and has a thin cuticle. The epidermal cells are vacuolated and pigments or food reserves are absent. The parenchyma cells of immature FBs have dense cytoplasm showing mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and plastids. Mature FB cells store oils, which are free in the cytosol and occupy a large portion of the cell lumen. In these cells the plastids accumulate starch. CONCLUSIONS: The lipids present in FBs are glycerin esters characteristic of plant energy reserves. Ants were observed collecting these FBs, which allows us to infer that these structures mediate plant-ant interactions and can help protect the young plants against herbivores, as these structures are prevalent at this developmental stage.",

Smith was investigated at the Ulu Gombak Field Studies Centre, Selangor, West Malaysia.  Based on the dissection of 54 stem internodes from 12 different culms of the large bamboo Gigantochloa scortechinii Gamble and on the mapping of 3 colonies, the following demographic characteristics emerge.  The colonies are monogynous, but highly polydomous, at least up to 36 internodes & up to 9 stems occupied.  This is very populous for a pseudomyrmecine not involved in an ant-plant mutualism.  One completely censused colony had 6953 adult workers & 2079 alates (=adults plus pupae).  The single queen suppresses gyne development in her own nest and, to a lesser extent, in other nests within the same stem.  The overall numerical sex ratio was 0.96:1 (= females:males), the investment sex ratio, 2.93:1, i.e., almost exactly the 3:1 ratio expected for a monogynous outbred hymenopteran in which the colony queen also produces all the male offspring.  Brood is distributed to all other nest chambers, from the queenright chamber.  The symbiotic pseudococcids, Kermicus wroughtoni Newstead, are present in all inhabited internodes, with small early instar individuals prevailing numerically by far over the larger stages.  The secluded honeydew supply within the internode and the efficient architectural protection provided by the internode wall (i.e., access usually only through a 2 X 3 mm-hole) allow T. sp. PSW-80 to reach an unusually large colony size, without being an aggressive & protective plant mutualist like other members of its subfamily with similar demographic features.]",

The main resource that plants offer to ants is extrafloral nectar (EFN) and the major part of published studies shown benefits from ants to plants possessing EFNs. However, the complementary question of whether and how ants benefit from EFNs is rarely addressed. Here, we present the results of a long-term study to demonstrate whether EFN has a positive effect on ant colony fitness. We quantified colony growth rate, survival and the final weight of individuals as measures of benefit derived from EFN. Our results provide clear evidence that EFN can have a significant positive impact on the survivorship, growth and reproduction of the Myrmicinae Cephalotes pusillus. In fact, a diet rich in EFN (providing at least 30 cal per day) resulted in five times more individuals per colony, greater body weights, and more eggs. These results have shed new light on the relationships between ants and EFN-bearing plants such as in tropical and temperate systems. The ant C. pusillus is the first case in which we have firm evidence that EFN improves colony growth and development, corroborating more than 100 years of experimental evidence of benefits to plants in these widespread relationships.",

We examine the comparative sensitivity of plant and ant assemblages to climatic change, and determine if we should expect community breakdown and a loss of ecosystem function under climate change. LOCATION: A bioclimatic gradient from the temperate to arid zone in South Australia. METHODS: We sampled plant and ant assemblages along the gradient to establish assemblage\u0010level responses to spatial climatic change using ordinations, and then projected assemblage responses to future climate change scenarios. RESULTS: We recorded totals of 363 plant and 227 ant species. Alignment between plant and ant communities was high, suggesting a high degree of similarity in the structuring of plant and ant communities in relation to environmental variation. However, our modelling suggested that ant assemblages were up to 7.5 times more sensitive to projected climate change than were plant assemblages, forecasting a very substantial decoupling of these assemblages under a future climate. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a high degree of community reorganization and change in ecosystem function should be expected under climate change.",

This trade-off has important implications for understanding the evolution of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), an adaptation that has repeatedly evolved throughout the flowering plant clade. We propose that the outcome of this trade-off is contingent on the specific traits of the organisms involved. We provide evidence that the protective mutualisms between ants and plants mediated by EFNs have optimal protective ant partners, represented by the optimum point of the balance between positive effects on plant protection and negative effects on pollination process. Our review also provides important details about a potential synergism of EFN functionality; that is, these structures can attract ants to protect against herbivores and/or distract them from flowers so as not to disrupt pollination processes. Finally, we argue that generalizations regarding how ants impact plants should be made with caution since ants\u0019 effects on plants vary with the identity of the ant species in their overall net outcome.",

    "abstract": "Plants allocate defences in order to decrease costs and maximize benefits against herbivores. The Optimal Defense Theory (ODT) predicts that continuously expressed (i.e. constitutive) defences are expected in structures of high value, whereas defences that are expressed or that increase their expression only after damage or upon risk of damage (i.e. induced defences) are expected in structures of low value. Although there are several studies evaluating ODT predictions, few studies have successfully tested them as a way of measuring ecological investment in extrafloral nectary (EFN)\u0010mediated ant\u0013plant interactions. Here we compared extrafloral nectar production and ant attractiveness to EFNs located on vegetative versus reproductive plant structures on Qualea multiflora plants subjected to different levels of simulated herbivory. We then addressed the following predictions emerging from the ODT: (a) extrafloral nectar produced in inflorescence EFNs will have higher volumes and calories and will attract more ants than extrafloral nectar produced in leaf EFNs; (b) extrafloral nectar production (volume and calories) and ant attendance will increase after simulated herbivory in leaf EFNs but not in inflorescence EFNs; (c) higher simulated leaf herbivory will induce higher extrafloral nectar production in EFNs on leaves and (d) more attractive extrafloral nectar (higher volume and calories) will attract more ants. Extrafloral nectar volume and calorie content, as well as ant abundance, were higher in EFNs of inflorescences compared to EFNs of leaves both before and after simulated herbivory, consistent with one of our predictions. However, EFNs on both leaves and inflorescences, not on leaves only, were induced by simulated herbivory, a pattern opposite to our prediction. Plants subjected to higher levels of leaf damage produced more and higher calorie extrafloral nectar, but showed similar ant abundance. Finally, more attractive extrafloral nectar attracted more ants. Synthesis. Our results show that extrafloral nectar production before and after simulated herbivory, as well as ant recruitment, varies according to the plant structure on which EFNs are located. Our study is the first to show that ant recruitment via extrafloral nectar follows predictions from Optimal Defense Theory, and that the ant foraging patterns may be shaped by the plant part attacked and the level of damage it receives.",

    "abstract": "AIM: Extrafloral nectar, a carbohydrate\u0010rich liquid, is the main plant\u0010based resource offered in exchange for ant protection. The positive results of this protection provided by ants are widely studied and supported; however, studies showing the benefits that ants and their colonies have from the resources offered by plants such as extrafloral nectar are scarce. Here, we evaluated how extrafloral nectar and artificial food resources with different nutrient concentration benefit short\u0010 and long\u0010term Camponotus crassus colony fitness (number and weight of individuals) and survival. METHODS: We conducted two sets of experiments: (1) in the field we attached artificial ant nests to plants with clogged and unclogged extrafloral nectaries; and (2) in the laboratory we offered artificial food resources with different carbohydrate\u0013protein ratios to ant colonies. With these experiments, we evaluated the number and weight of queens, adult workers, pupae, larvae, and eggs, as well as the survival probability of the colonies. RESULTS: In the first experiment, the short\u0010term provision of extrafloral nectar resulted in a larger number and weight of individuals with access to this resource. In the second experiment, regardless of time, the supply of more concentrated carbohydrate and nitrogen food increased ant colony fitness and survival. Conclusion: We provided new evidence that extrafloral nectar significantly benefits ant colonies. Our results corroborate the assertion that these relationships are reciprocally beneficial.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that the outcomes of mutualistic interactions between ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are context\u0010dependent. In particular, the total number, density, and size of EFNs, as well as the abundance and identity of ants attending host plants, are considered as key factors determining the nature and strength of ant\u0013EFN\u0010bearing plant interaction. Although many previous studies have investigated context\u0010dependency in ant\u0013plant protection mutualisms mediated by EFNs, few have tested whether the protective behavior of ants varies among sympatric plant species. In this study, we performed a field experiment to investigate the predatory behavior of a dominant ant species (Camponotus crassus, Formicinae) among five EFN\u0010bearing plant species growing in the Brazilian savanna. In particular, we studied the variation in the ant abundance, termite predation, and time spent to find termites of C. crassus among the plant species, and further analyzed whether this variation could be related to the extrafloral nectar volume and sugar concentration of each plant species. We found that abundance and termite predation of C. crassus markedly varied among plant species. Specifically, C. crassus ants were significantly more abundant, active, and protective in Qualea multiflora, the plant species that produced significantly higher volumes and sugar concentrations of nectar. Overall, our results suggest that variation in extrafloral nectar volume and sugar concentration can result in plant species specificity of defensive behavior of a dominant foliage\u0010dwelling ant in the Brazilian savanna.

    "abstract": "Interactions between ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are among the most common mutualisms in Neotropical regions. Plants secrete extrafloral nectar, a carbohydrate\u0010rich food that attracts ants, which in return protect plants against herbivores. This ant\u0013plant mutualism is subjected to temporal variation, in which abiotic factors can drive the establishment and frequency of such mutualistic interaction. However, studies investigating how abiotic factors (e.g. climate) directly and indirectly influence ant\u0013plant\u0013herbivore interactions are incipient. In this study, we investigated direct and indirect (via plant phenology) effects of temperature and rainfall on ant\u0013plant\u0013herbivore interactions. To address these goals, each month we estimated six plant phenophases (newly flushed leaves, fully expanded leaves, deciduousness, floral buds, flowers and fruits), the activity of EFNs and abundance of ants and herbivores in 18 EFN\u0010bearing plant species growing in a markedly seasonal region (the Brazilian Cerrado) during a complete growing season. Our results showed that (a) there were marked seasonal patterns in all plant phenophases, EFN activity and the abundance of ants and herbivores; (b) the peak of EFN activity and ant and herbivore abundance simultaneously occurred at the beginning of the rainy season, when new leaves flushed and (c) rainfall directly and indirectly (via changes in the production of new leaves) influenced EFN activity and this in turn provoked changes in ant abundance (but not on herbivores). Synthesis. Overall, our results build towards a better understanding of how climate drives seasonal patterns in ant\u0013plant\u0013herbivore interactions, explicitly considering plant phenology over time.",

    "abstract": "Landslides and gullies are two common manifestations of land degradation in the densely populated Colombian Andes. In these unstable areas, further mass movements pose a serious threat to local populations and cause off-site environmental damage through sedimentation, pollution, and increased flooding. A novel approach for restoring severely eroded slopes combines the use of stabilization structures made with stalks of Guadua angustifolia Kunth, Poaceae (bamboo), with high-density planting of species that exhibit quick growth and sprouting. This study compared the vegetation and ground-dwelling ant assemblages of 10 pairs of gullies, each pair formed by one enhanced and one untreated or control gully, 6-8 years after restoration or abandonment. The restoration treatment had significant effects on the complexity of vegetation. Average values for plant species richness, basal area, stem density, foliage density index, and total vegetation volume were 11.6, 140, 30, 11.5, and 15.6 times larger, respectively, in enhanced than in control gullies. Mirroring the differences in vegetation, average ant species richness was significantly larger (13 vs. 7.6 species per gully), and a higher proportion of ant species nested within enhanced than control gullies (52.5 vs. 30%). While control gullies were dominated by generalist ants such as Ectatomma ruidum and Linepithema angulatum, enhanced gullies had more specialized ground-dwelling species, normally associated with high plant cover and abundant leaf litter such as Octostruma balzani and Heteroponera inca. We conclude that this restoration strategy promotes a fast recovery of vegetation and the ground-dwelling ant fauna in these tropical mountains.",

    "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation has a marked impact on the functional composition of tropical forest tree assemblages, and such change is likely to cascade through other trophic levels. Here, we investigate how habitat fragmentation affects extrafloral nectary (EFN)\u0010bearing plants and ant functional groups known to attend EFNs in a fragmented landscape of the Atlantic Forest. Extrafloral nectary\u0010bearing trees were identified in 50 0.1\u0010ha plots located in forest fragments, edge and interior patches. Ants were surveyed in 30 1\u0010m\u2264 litter samples in each of 17 forest fragments and in forest interior. Extrafloral nectary\u0010bearing plants accounted for 19.9% of individuals and 10.5% of species and included both pioneer and shade\u0010tolerant species similarly rich in the three habitat types. However, shade\u0010tolerant individuals accounted for >80% of EFN\u0010bearing plants in forest interior, compared with 2% in forest edge and 29% in fragments. Forest edge and fragment plots had a third fewer EFN\u0010bearing individuals and species compared with forest interior. This appeared to have important implications for local ant communities as the density of EFN\u0010bearing trees was the most important variable explaining the species richness of arboreal dominant ants. Our results show that plant loser-winner replacements promoted by forest fragmentation can cascade through higher trophic levels, with implications for forest dynamics and biodiversity conservation.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is projected to exacerbate the effects of anthropogenic disturbance, with negative impacts on ecosystem stability and functioning. We evaluate the additive and combined effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) and rainfall variation on the temporal stability of mutualistic EFN\u0010bearing plant\u0013ant networks in a Caatinga dry forest. We evaluated whether changes in the stability of these interactions are driven by changes in the stability of the communities of partners involved and/or in ant behavior. We sampled EFN\u0010bearing plant\u0013ant networks in sixteen 20\t\u25ca\t20\tm plots distributed across CAD and rainfall gradients. The stability of EFN\u0010bearing plant and attendant\u0013ant communities were measured as the inverse of temporal differences in their community structure and composition. We also computed the stability of EFN\u0010bearing plant\u0013ant networks by measuring the inverse of temporal differences in network specialization metrics. We found that, in general, the structure and composition of plant and ant interacting communities were similarly stable along both environmental gradients. Only CAD and its interaction with rainfall affected the temporal stability of EFN\u0010bearing plant diversity, which declined as CAD increased, with a more pronounced relationship in wetter areas. However, variation in levels of CAD and, to a lesser extent, rainfall greatly modulated the stability of EFN\u0010bearing plant\u0013ant network specialization. CAD reduced the stability of network generality (specialization at the ant level), an effect that was much stronger in wetter areas. Meanwhile, the stability in network vulnerability (specialization at the plant level) decreased with the increase of CAD and the decrease of rainfall levels. Finally, there was a trend of decreasing stability in specialization of the overall network with increasing CAD. Our results suggest that changes in the structure of interaction networks are mainly driven by a switch in ant behavior rather than by changes in the structure and composition of plant and ant communities between years.          *[We observed 312 interactions between 17 EFN-bearing plant & 25 ant species in 2014, & 243 interactions between 19 EFN-bearing plant & 26 ant species in 2016 (a total of 555 interactions during the 2 years of study, involving 23 EFN-bearing plant & 33 ant species.]          *[Linepithema neotropicum misspelled Linephitema neotropicum.]",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic disturbance and climate change might negatively affect the ecosystem services provided by mutualistic networks. However, the effects of such forces remain poorly characterized. They may be especially important in dry forests, which (1) experience chronic anthropogenic disturbances (CADs) as human populations exploit forest resources, and (2) are predicted to face a 22% decline in rainfall under climate change. In this study, we investigated the separate and combined effects of CADs and rainfall levels on the specialization of mutualistic networks in the Caatinga, a seasonally dry tropical forest typical of north\u0010eastern Brazil. More specifically, we examined interactions between plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and ants. We analysed whether differences in network specialization could arise from environmentally mediated variation in the species composition, namely via the replacement of specialist by generalist species. We characterized these ant-plant networks in 15 plots (20 \u25ca 20 m) that varied in CAD intensity and mean annual rainfall. We quantified CAD intensity by calculating three indices related to the main sources of disturbance in the Caatinga: livestock grazing (LG), wood extraction (WE) and miscellaneous resource use (MU). We determined the degree of ant-plant network specialization using four metrics: generality, vulnerability, interaction evenness and H\u00c72. Our results indicate that CADs differentially influenced network specialization: we observed positive, negative, and neutral responses along LG, MU and WE gradients, respectively. The pattern was most pronounced with LG. Rainfall also shaped network specialization, markedly increasing it. While LG and rainfall were associated with changes in network species composition, this trend was not related to the degree of species specialization. This result suggests that shifts in network specialization might be related to changes in species behaviour, not species composition. Our study highlights the vulnerability of such dry forest ant-plant networks to climate change. Moreover, dry forests experience highly heterogeneous anthropogenic disturbances, creating a geographic mosaic of selective forces that may shape the co\u0010evolution of interactions between ants and EFN-bearing plants.          *[Linepithema neotropicum misspelled Linephitema neotropicum.]",

    "abstract": "How environmental contexts shape the strength of species interactions, and their influence on community structure, remains a key focus for the field of community ecology. In particular, the extent to which local competitive interactions impact community structure, and whether this differs across contexts, persists as a general issue that is unresolved across a broad range of animal systems. Studies of arboreal ants have shown that competitive interactions over carbon\u0010rich exudates from extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and homopteran aggregations can have positive and negative effects on the local abundances of individual species. Nevertheless, it is still unclear the extent to which these local effects scale to community\u0010level effects. Here we address the role of food from extrafloral nectaries on the structure of arboreal ant communities in a savanna of central Brazil. We did this with a combination of a diversity survey across tree species with and without EFNs, a repeated survey at times of peak EFN activity, and testing of our survey findings with two experimental manipulations of nectar availability that also provided supplementary nesting cavities. Species richness, but not composition, differed significantly between trees with and without EFNs. However, trees with EFNs had, on average, only 9% more species than those without EFNs. Furthermore, ant species richness did not differ significantly between periods of high and low EFN activity. Although nectar supplementation significantly affected nest occupation rates, this difference was seen solely in the experiment with a massive supply of nectar and there was no effect on total ant richness or identity of the focal assemblages. Our findings suggest that the effects of extrafloral nectar on the abundances of arboreal ants at local scales do not scale to a strong structuring force at the community level. We suggest that this is most likely due to a lack of specificity of community members for EFN tree species, and the diffuse temporal and spatial nature of the availability of active EFNs. These properties mean that observable short\u0010lived activity and competition over particular EFNs does not ultimately drive lasting changes in the associated assemblage of species, and therefore, the community as a whole.",

    "abstract": "*[The goal of this work was to test and evaluate the importance of nectar resources in the structure of the ant community in the Brazilian cerrado, a neotropical savanna.  The natural experiment & field experimental manipulation were conducted in a reserve located near Uberl\u201andia, SE Brazil.  The natural experiment aimed to evaluate the differences in the ant community & the influence of the seasonality on this resource (extrafloral nectaries) in tree species with & without extrafloral nectaries in 2 periods of the year, one when the extrafloral nectaries were mostly inactive (between June & July of 2010) & one in the peak of extrafloral nectar production (between October & November 2010).  For that, I sampled 6 common species of trees in the cerrado, Caryocar brasiliense, Qualea grandiflora, & Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, that have extrafloral nectaries &  Sclerolobium aureum, Machaerium opacum, & Kielmeyeria coriacea, that does not have extrafloral nectaries.  In total, 92 trees were sampled, ranging from 12 to 18 individuals of each tree species.  The sampling was done using arboreal pitfall traps, left for 48 hours on the plants.  I did not find any significant differences in ant species richness for plants with or without extrafloral nectaries, nor any effect for different times of the year.  However, at the individual level (plant by plant), there was a bigger species turnover between sampling times in plants with extrafloral nectaries than in those without it (not been observed at the population level).  I did an experimental manipulation with the addition of artificial nectaries in 2 plant species, one that naturally have extrafloral nectaries (C. brasiliense) & one that naturally does not have them (S. aureum).  I measured the rates of occupation of artificial wood nests (20 nests per tree).  The artificial nectaries were made of 2 ml eppendorfs, which were filled weekly with a solution of water, sugar, & amino acids (resembling natural extrafloral nectar constitution).  I placed 40 eppendorfs in 20 trees of each plant species, 10 treatments & 10 controls.  The occupation rate was significantly higher in plants with artificial nectar addition in S. aureum, but not in C. brasiliense.]          *[Cephalotes atratus misspelled Chephalotes atratus; Cephalotes clypeatus misspelled Chephalotes clypeatus; Cephalotes sp. 11 misspelled Chephalotes sp. 11; Pachycondyla villosa misspelled Pachycondila villosa; Pachycondyla sp. 02 misspelled Pachycondilla sp. 02.]",

Arboreal ants are shown to be a unique component of diversity, despite lower species richness than ground ants.  The abundance of dominant ants influences species richness on the ground, but not on vegetation.   In contrast to most ant-plant systems, individual camelthorn acacia trees, Vachellia erioloba, are stably & simultaneously inhabited by multiple ant species that nest within swollen-thorn domatia.  The ant community on V. erioloba provides defence against herbivorous insects, although their effectiveness varies with herbivore identity.  Nest site selection by the 4 taxonomically diverse ant species on V. erioloba is based on domatia morphology.  Colony size increases with domatia size, but each species responds differently to availability of nesting space through varying levels of investment in brood production.  Ants inhabiting myrmecophytes are thought to be nest-site limited & under intense competition.  Unusually, on V. erioloba this is not the case, which may facilitate the rare coexistence of multiple ant species on individual host plants in this system.]",

    "abstract": "Nest site selection in arboreal, domatia-dwelling ants, particularly those coexisting on a single host plant, is little understood. To examine this phenomenon we studied the African savannah tree Vachellia erioloba, which hosts ants in swollen-thorn domatia. We found four ant species from different genera (Cataulacus intrudens, Tapinoma subtile, Tetraponera ambigua and an unidentified Crematogaster species). In contrast to other African ant plants, many V. erioloba trees (41 % in our survey) were simultaneously co-occupied by more than one ant species. Our study provides quantitative field data describing: (1) aspects of tree and domatia morphology relevant to supporting a community of mutualist ants, (2) how ant species occupancy varies with domatia morphology and (3) how ant colony size varies with domatia size and species. We found that Crematogaster sp. occupy the largest thorns, followed by C. intrudens, with T. subtile in the smallest thorns. Thorn age, as well as nest entrance hole size correlated closely with ant species occupant. These differing occupancy patterns may help to explain the unusual coexistence of three ant species on individual myrmecophytic trees. In all three common ant species, colony size, as measured by total number of ants, increased with domatia size. Additionally, domatia volume and species identity interact to predict ant numbers, suggesting differing responses between species to increased availability of nesting space. The proportion of total ants in nests that were immatures varied with thorn volume and species, highlighting the importance of domatia morphology in influencing colony structure.",

    "abstract": "*[Individual camelthorn trees (Vachellia erioloba) typically host 2 to 4 ant species simultaneously, often coexisting in adjacent domatia on the same branch.  Such fine-grain spatial coexistence brings into question the conventional wisdom on ant-myrmecophyte mutualisms.  Camelthorn ants appear not to be nest-site limited, despite low abundance of suitable domatia, & have random distributions of nest-sites within & across trees.  These patterns suggest a lack of competition between ants for domatia & contrast strongly with other ant-myrmecophyte systems.  Comparison of this unusual case with others suggests that spatial scale is crucial to coexistence or competitive exclusion involving multiple ant species.  Coexistence may be facilitated when co-occurring ant species diverge strongly on at least one niche axis.  We collected data on 3,448 thorns from 197 branches across 20 V. erioloba trees, confirming that V. erioloba domatia were occupied by 4 ant species; an unidentified Crematogaster species, Cataulacus intrudens, an unidentified Tapinoma species, & Tetraponera ambigua.  The smallest species, Tapinoma, was the most abundant, accounting for 77% of all individual ants surveyed, followed by Crematogaster (13%), Cataulacus (8%), & Tetraponera (2%).  Tapinoma was also the most prevalent, found on 19 of 20 trees.

Here, we generate a database of plant cultivation by ants, identify three main types, and show that these interactions evolved primarily for shelter rather than food. We find that plant cultivation evolved at least 68 times independently for crops (~200 plant species), and 16 times in farmer lineages (~37 ant taxa) in the Neotropics and Asia/Australasia. Because of their high evolutionary replication, and variation in partner dependence, these systems are powerful models to unveil the steps in the evolution and ecology of insect agriculture.",

    "abstract": "The two most important ant-plant attractions are extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and hemipteran honeydew. In both cases, ants may offer an effective protection against natural enemies of plants, in exchange for its sugar-rich exudates. The aim of this paper was to compare the efficiency of ant protection between plants with EFNs and with hemipteran honeydew. The study was carried out in the Amazonian Rain Forest Reserve at km 41 (02-degrees 24'S, 59-degrees 44'W), located 80 km from Manaus. We recorded 24 ant species in 25 plants species in the forest understory along two line transects of 5 km. The efficiency of ants in protecting plants was measured by an experiment of prey removal using isopteran workers. It was found that ants are more effective and faster in attacking termites when using honeydew rather than EFNs, probably due to the larger resource monopolization. This study further underlines the importance of experimental studies to elucidate the ecological and evolutionary importance of EFNs and honeydew in ant-plant defense against herbivores.          *[We recorded 24 ant species in 25 plants species in the forest understory, along 2 line transects of 5 km.

This approach has revealed general patterns in network structure, but limits our ability to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape these networks and to predict the consequences of natural and human\u0010driven disturbance on species interactions. We review the growing literature on temporal dynamics of plant\u0013animal mutualistic networks including pollination, seed dispersal and ant defence mutualisms. We then discuss potential mechanisms underlying such variation in interactions, ranging from behavioural and physiological processes at the finest temporal scales to ecological and evolutionary processes at the broadest. We find that at the finest temporal scales (days, weeks, months) mutualistic interactions are highly dynamic, with considerable variation in network structure. At intermediate scales (years, decades), networks still exhibit high levels of temporal variation, but such variation appears to influence network properties only weakly. At the broadest temporal scales (many decades, centuries and beyond), continued shifts in interactions appear to reshape network structure, leading to dramatic community changes, including loss of species and function. Our review highlights the importance of considering the temporal dimension for understanding the ecology and evolution of complex webs of mutualistic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Context-dependence in mutualisms is a fundamental aspect of ecological interactions. Within plant-ant mutualisms, particularly in terms of biotic protection and pollination, research has predominantly focused on elucidating the benefits while largely overlooking potential costs. This notable gap underscores the need for investigations into the drawbacks and trade-offs associated with such mutualistic relationships. Here, we evaluated the role of pericarpial nectaries (PNs) in shaping the dynamics of ant-pollinator mutualisms. Specifically, we investigated whether ants visiting the PN of Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae) could deter hummingbirds and disrupt pollination, ultimately influencing fruit production. Our research involved manipulative experiments and observation of ant-pollinator interactions on P. rigida plants in the Brazilian savannah. We found that visiting ants can deter hummingbirds and/or disrupt pollination in P. rigida, directly influencing fruit set. However, these results are species-specific. The presence of very aggressive, large predatory ants, such as E. tuberculatum, had a negative impact on hummingbird behavior, whereas aggressive mid-sized ants, such as C. crassus, showed no effects. Our study illuminates the multifaceted aspects of ant-plant mutualisms and underscores the importance of evaluating costs and unexpected outcomes within these ecological relationships.",

    "abstract": "Although ants may induce community-wide effects via changes in physical habitats in terrestrial environments, their influence on aquatic communities living in plant-held waters remains largely underexplored. The neotropical tank-bromeliad Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) occurs along forest edges in ant-gardens initiated by Camponotus femoratus or by Pachycondyla goeldii. Its leaves form wells that hold rainwater and provide suitable habitats for many aquatic organisms. We postulated that these ant-plant mutualisms indirectly affect the microbial community structure via changes in the environmental conditions experienced by the plants. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the protist communities from 63 tank-bromeliads associated with either C. femoratus or P. goeldii (hereafter Cf-Aechmea and Pg-Aechmea) along a forest edge in French Guiana. For each plant, a large number of environmental variables (including habitat structure, food resources, incident radiation and the presence of aquatic invertebrates) were quantified to determine their relative importance in driving any observed differences across ant-associated plants. Pg-Aechmea are located in sun-exposed areas and hold low volumes of water and low amounts of detritus, whereas Cf-Aechmea are located in partially shaded areas and accumulate higher amounts of water and detritus. Protists (i.e., protozoa and algae) inhabiting Cf-Aechmea exhibit greater richness and abundances than those in Pg-Aechmea. Variations in detritus content, number of leaves, incident radiation, and the epiphyte richness of the ant-garden were the main factors explaining the variation in protist richness. A shift in the functional group composition of protists between bromeliads tended by different ant species suggested that mutualistic ants indirectly mediate changes in the microbial food web.",

    "abstract": "1. Despite the essential role of pollination in the maintenance of many rare plant species, conservation management plans rarely consider the service of pollination. 2. This study identifies the main pollinators of a rare English plant species, Trinia glauca (Apiaceae), and provides recommendations for its conservation. A community-level approach is used, whereby a visitation network is constructed to identify the direct and indirect links between T. glauca and other members of the plant-visitor community. 3. A field experiment that excluded the main visitor species from female T. glauca showed that ants were the main pollinators of T. glauca. The network revealed that over the field season, 33% of the ants' visits to flowers were to alien plants, with Cotoneaster horizontalis making a particularly high contribution (58%) during the T. glauca flowering period. 4. The removal of alien plants is a part of the conservation management of T. glauca, and we simulated the likely consequences of this form of habitat management on T. glauca pollination, any effects being mediated by shared pollinators. Although positive or neutral effects are possible, a negative effect is also possible, whereby the removal of alien plants leads to a crash in ant populations, potentially reducing pollinator visits to T. glauca by up to 85.2%. 5. Synthesis and applications. Conserving the pollinators of rare plants is essential if their conservation is to be sustainable in the long term. Our data indicate that T. glauca is pollinated by ants and demonstrate that ants can also feed on alien plants, particularly during the flowering season of this rare plant. We suggest that management measures involving the removal of alien plants should consider the possible negative impacts on rare plants through changes in pollinator populations. In this case, a staged removal is likely to prove the best conservation approach, allowing the pollinators' response to be assessed before any serious negative effects occur.          *[The species of insect that visited T. glauca were: the ants Lasius alienus ss F\u02c6rster (59.3% of visitors), Formica fusca L.

However, due to the structural diversity found in this genus and the lack of data on which foragers visit these flowers, our aim is to elucidate floral anatomical aspects of the Stanhopeinae group, focusing on the secreting structures of Stanhopea grandiflora Lindl., an orchid that occurs in the Amazon region. Analyses were performed under bright-field microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Osmophores, nectaries, idioblasts and glandular trichomes were the secreting structures observed in Stanhopea grandiflora. The osmophores are responsible for attracting and offering rewards the male Euglossini bees, which are their exclusive pollinators, while the nectaries offering nectar to the foragers Dolichoderus and Azteca ants which in turn offer protection against herbivores.

    "abstract": "*[Most ant species are generalist feeders, & only some ground-nesting & ground-foraging species are strictly predators.  Ants are central-place foragers (with the exception of army ants during the nomadic phase) that may use different foraging strategies.  Solitary hunting is the most common method employed by predatory ants.  Cooperative hunting, considered more evolved than solitary hunting, is used by army ants & other ants such as Myrmicaria opaciventris, Paratrechina longicornis or the dominant arboreal Oecophylla.  Army ants are predators with different levels of specialization, some of which focus on a particular genus or species, as is the case for Nomamyrmex esenbeckii which organizes subterranean raids on the very large colonies of the leaf-cutting species Atta cephalotes or A. colombica.  Arboreal ants have  evolved predatory behaviors adapted to the tree foliage, where prey are unpredictable & able to escape by flying away, jumping or dropping.  The weaver ant, Oecophylla longinoda, for example, hunts prey diurnally in groups.  They detect prey visually from a relatively long distance & the workers adhere to the plant substrate by means of very powerful adhesive pads & claws.  On some occasions, during prey retrieval, the prey can be stolen by other ants; food-robbing is more frequent in ground-dwelling than in arboreal species.  Many predatory ants are engaged in a kind of arms race: they have evolved morpho-physiological adaptations to foil prey defense or escape mechanisms.  Mandible shapes have changed & powerful venoms have been developed by different species.  Depending on their prey specialization ants can have many different mandible shapes: trap-jaw mandibles, nutcracker mandibles adapted to hunting long prey, pitch-fork mandibles, falciform mandibles, & long mandibles.  Other ant species are specialized in hunting a certain prey type, but do not have a mandible shape particular to that specialization; these species are egg predators, collembolan predators, or social insect predators.  Some ant species are either specialized or occasional termite predators.]          [NOTE: S. saevissima is S. invicta or S. richteri in North America.]",

    "abstract": "1 Our understanding of the contribution of interspecific interactions to functional diversity in nature lags behind our knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns. Although two-species mutualisms are found in all types of ecosystems, the study of their ecological influences on other community members has mostly been limited to third species, while their influence on entire communities remains largely unexplored.  2 We hypothesized that mutualistic interactions between two respective ant species and an epiphyte mediate the biological traits composition of entire invertebrate communities that use the same host plant, thereby affecting food webs and functional diversity at the community level.  3 Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) is both a phytotelm ('plant-held water') and an ant-garden epiphyte. We sampled 111 bromeliads (111 aquatic invertebrate communities) associated with either the ant Pachycondyla goeldii or Camponotus femoratus. The relationships between ants, bromeliads and invertebrate abundance data were examined using a redundancy analysis. Biological traits information for invertebrates was structured using a fuzzy-coding technique, and a co-inertia analysis between traits and abundance data was used to interpret functional differences in bromeliad ecosystems.  4 The vegetative traits of A. mertensii depended on seed dispersion by C. femoratus and P. goeldii along a gradient of local conditions. The ant partner selected sets of invertebrates with traits that were best adapted to the bromeliads' morphology, and so the composition of the biological traits of invertebrate phytotelm communities depends on the identity of the ant partner. Biological traits suggest a bottom-up control of community structure in C. femoratus-associated phytotelmata and a greater structuring role for predatory invertebrates in P. goeldii-associated plants. 5 This study presents new information showing that two-species mutualisms affect the functional diversity of a much wider range of organisms. Most biological systems form complex networks where nodes (e.g. species) are more or less closely linked to each other, either directly or indirectly, through intermediate nodes. Our observations provide community-level information about biological interactions and functional diversity, and perspectives for further observations intended to examine whether large-scale changes in interacting species/community structure over broad geographical and anthropogenic gradients affect ecosystem functions.",

The role of ants as pollinators is highly variable, in some cases they act as true pollinators and in others as antagonists damaging flowers, robbing nectar or disrupting pollination. Pollinator visitation frequency has been demonstrated as the most important factor determining their impact on plants. Ants are commonly seen as visitors of the desert shrub Condalia microphylla, but their effectiveness as pollinators is unknown. In this study we assess the quantitative and qualitative role of ants and other winged flower visitors as pollinators of C. microphylla by experimentally quantifying their contribution to fruit production. The study was conducted in the Monte Desert of Villavicencio Nature Reserve, Mendoza, Argentina. A diverse assemblage of insects visited flowers of C. microphylla, including bees, ants, flies, beetles and vespids. Ants (Camponotus mus and Camponotus punctulatus) accounted for a high proportion of interactions. Fruit set resulted mostly from pollination by winged insects, while flowers visited by ants did not set fruits. Thus, although ants were commonly seen on flowers, their effectiveness as pollinator was negligible for Condalia microphylla.",

    "abstract": "Exotic plants are involved in different interactions with the fauna of the invaded sites, which can facilitate or limit their successful establishment and spread. Here, we evaluated the impact of native aphid-tending ants on the reproductive consequences of the invasive thistle Carduus thoermeri in NW Patagonia, which is frequently infested by aphids. We estimated the number and proportion of viable seeds, seed weight, germination proportion, and mean germination time of thistles in the presence and absence of aphids and ants, and with or without pollinator access. Aphid-infested thistles had 57% less viable seeds and 29% lower seed weight than non-infested thistles. Although ants and aphids had no effect on germination proportion, the mean germination time was ca. 15% faster in seeds from aphid-infested thistles. Our results suggest that the potential indirect effects of aphid-tending ants on thistles (negative effects via pollinator deterrence and positive effects via driving away non-aphid herbivores) are less important than the direct negative effects of aphids. Interestingly, although harboring aphids and ants has negative reproductive consequences for C. thoermeri plants, it could also generate a competitive advantage by giving rise to small and fast germinated seeds. This study illustrates the complexity of novel interactions among exotic plants and native ants, reinforcing the need for more studies to fully understand the potential impact of ant\u0013plant interactions mediated by Hemiptera on the invasion success of plants.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific interactions are often mediated by the interplay between resource supply and consumer density. The supply of a resource and a consumer's density response to it may in turn yield context\u0010dependent use of other resources. Such consumer\u0013resource interactions occur not only for predator\u0013prey and competitive interactions, but for mutualistic ones as well. For example, consumer\u0013resource interactions between ants and extrafloral nectar (EFN) plants are often mutualistic, as EFN resources attract and reward ants which protect plants from herbivory. Yet, ants also commonly exploit floral resources, leading to antagonistic consumer\u0013resource interactions by disrupting pollination and plant reproduction. EFN resources associated with mutualistic ant\u0013plant interactions may also mediate antagonistic ant\u0013flower interactions through the aggregative density response of ants on plants, which could either exacerbate ant\u0013flower interactions or alternatively satiate and distract ants from floral resources. In this study, we examined how EFN resources mediate the density response of ants on senita cacti in the Sonoran Desert and their context\u0010dependent use of floral resources. Removal of EFN resources reduced the aggregative density of ants on plants, both on hourly and daily time scales. Yet, the increased aggregative ant density on plants with EFN resources decreased rather than increased ant use of floral resources, including contacts with and time spent in flowers. Behavioral assays showed no confounding effect of floral deterrents on ant\u0013flower interactions. Thus, ant use of floral resources depends on the supply of EFN resources, which mediates the potential for both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions by increasing the aggregative density of ants protecting plants, while concurrently distracting ants from floral resources. Nevertheless, only certain years and populations of study showed an increase in plant reproduction through herbivore protection or ant distraction from floral resources. Despite pronounced effects of EFN resources mediating the aggregative density of ants on plants and their context\u0010dependent use of floral resources, consumer\u0013resource interactions remained largely commensalistic.",

    "abstract": "Context dependency, variation in the outcome of species interactions with biotic and abiotic conditions, is increasingly considered ubiquitous among mutualisms. Despite several qualitative reviews of many individual empirical studies, there has been little quantitative synthesis examining the generality of context dependency, or conditions that may promote it. We conducted a meta\u0010analysis of ant\u0013plant protection mutualisms to examine the generality of context\u0010dependent effects of ants on herbivory and plant performance (growth, reproduction). Our results show that ant effects on plants are not generally context dependent, but instead are routinely positive and rarely neutral, as overall effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory and increasing plant performance were positive and significantly greater than 0. The magnitude of these positive effects did vary, however. Variation in plant performance was not explained by the type of biotic or abiotic factor examined, including plant rewards (extrafloral nectar, food bodies, domatia), ant species richness, plant growth form, or latitude. With the exception of plant growth form, these factors did contribute to the effects of ants in reducing herbivory. Reductions in herbivory were greater for plants with than without domatia, and greatest for plants with both domatia and food bodies. Effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory decreased, but remained positive, with latitude and ant species richness. Effect sizes in reducing herbivory were greater in tropical vs. temperate systems. Although ant\u0013plant interactions have been pivotal in the study of context dependency of mutualisms, our results, along with other recent meta\u0010analyses, indicate that context dependency may not be a general feature of mutualistic interactions. Rather, ant\u0013plant protection mutualisms appear to be routinely positive for plants, and only occasionally neutral.",

With the recent application of network theory, the structure of previously neglected mutualistic communities has begun to be elucidated.  2.  Mutualistic communities have now been shown to follow particular power distributions in their degree, that is, the number of species interactions per species. However, predictive variables of degree and other structures of mutualistic networks remain largely unexplored.  3.  Here, we show that body size of ants is positively correlated with their degree in mutualistic networks comprised of ant interactions with extrafloral nectar (EFN) bearing plants in the Sonoran Desert. This pattern in body size and the number of plant species with which ants interact occurred among all eight sampled communities, a relationship which was not contingent upon phylogenetic history among ant species.   4.  These results indicate that further study of body size in ant-plant and other mutualistic networks may yield promising insights into the processes influencing their structure. Moreover, the degree-body size relationship for ant-plant mutualistic communities is consistent with that of predator-prey food webs, possibly suggesting similar underlying processes at work.",

While our understanding of the structural properties of mutualistic communities continues to improve, we know little of the biological variables resulting in them. Mutualistic communities include those formed between ants and extrafloral (EF) nectar-bearing plants. In this study, we examined the contributions of plant and ant abundance, plant and ant size, and plant EF nectar resources to the network structures of nestedness and interaction frequency of ant-plant networks across five sites within one geographic locality in the Sonoran Desert. Interactions between ant and plant species were largely symmetric. That is, ant and plant species exerted nearly equivalent quantitative interaction effects on one another, as measured by their frequency of interaction. The mutualistic ant-plant networks also showed nested patterns of structure, in which there was a central core of generalist ant and plant species interacting with one another and few specialist-specialist interactions. Abundance and plant size and ant body size were the best predictors of symmetric interactions between plants and ants, as well as nestedness. Despite interactions in these communities being ultimately mediated by EF nectar resources, the number of EF nectaries had a relatively weak ability to explain variation in symmetric interactions and nestedness. These results suggest that different mechanisms may contribute to structure of bipartite networks. Moreover, our results for ant-plant mutualistic networks support the general importance of species abundances for the structure of species interactions within biological communities.",

We investigated the micro-structure of the inner wall of the domatia using scanning electron microscopy, and observed that cells that form the inner lining of the domatia cavity have canaliculated, lignified sclerenchyma with numerous plasmodesmata, as reported for the true myrmecophyte Leonardoxa africana, which could explain the observed nutrient flux from domatia-dwelling invertebrates into the host plant.

    "abstract": "How a symbiosis originates and is maintained are important evolutionary questions. Symbioses in myrmecophytes (plants providing nesting for ants) are believed to be maintained by protection and nutrients provided by specialist plant-ants in exchange for nesting spaces (called domatia) and nourishment offered by ant-plants. However, besides the benefits accrued from housing protective ants, the mechanisms contributing to the fitness advantages of bearing domatia have rarely been examined, especially because the domatia trait is usually constitutively expressed, and many myrmecophytes have obligate mutualisms with single ant species resulting in invariant conditions. In the unspecialized ant-plant Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae) that offers extrafloral nectar to ants, only some plants produce domatia in the form of hollow internodes. These domatia have a self-opening slit making them more prone to interlopers and are occupied mostly by non-protective ants and other invertebrates, especially arboreal earthworms. The protection mutualism with ants is restricted in geographical extent, occurring only at a few sites in the southernmost part of this plant's range in the Western Ghats of India. We examined nutrient flux from domatia residents to the plant using stable isotopes. We found that between 9% (earthworms) and 17% (protective or non-protective ants) of nitrogen of plant tissues nearest the domatium came from domatia inhabitants. Therefore, interlopers such as earthworms and non-protective ants contributed positively to the nitrogen budget of localized plant modules of this understorey tree. 15N-enriched feeding experiments with protective ants demonstrated that nutrients flowed from domatia inhabitants to nearby plant modules. Fruit set did not differ between paired hand-pollinated inflorescences on domatia and non-domatia bearing branches. This was possibly due to the nutrient flux from domatia to adjacent branches without domatia within localized modules. This study has demonstrated the nutritive role of non-protective ants and non-ant invertebrates, hitherto referred to as interlopers, in an unspecialized myrmecophyte. Our study suggests that even before the establishment of a specialized ant-plant protection mutualism, nutritional benefits conferred by domatia inhabitants can explain the fitness benefits of bearing domatia, and thus the maintenance of a trait that facilitates the establishment of a specialized ant-plant symbiosis.",

However, it remained unclear whether the secondary dispersers could shape the traits of diaspores in myrmecochory. In this study, we analyzed the nutritional quality of seeds and their corresponding elaiosomes of the myrmecochorous plant Stemona tuberosa (Stemonaceae), whose diaspores are dispersed by ants and/or hornets. Our results show significant differences in the quantitative pattern of nutrients between seeds and elaiosomes, respectively. The elaiosomes of S. tuberosa contain significantly higher concentration of proteins, free fatty acids, free amino acids, soluble carbohydrates, and micronutrients than the seeds. The low mass ratio of seed/elaiosomes in S. tuberosa compared to other myrmecochorous species imply that seed dispersal by hornets might be discriminated from seed dispersal by ants. In conclusion, we suggest that hornets and ants obtain the essential nutrients from the elaiosomes of S. tuberosa and these rewards contribute to shape the hornet/ant-plant mutualism.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved numerous secretory structures that fulfill diverse roles and shape their interactions with other organisms. Rivea ornata (Roxb.) Choisy (Convolvulaceae) is one species that possesses various external secretory organs hypothesized to be ecologically important. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate five secretory structures (nectary disc, petiolar nectaries, calycinal glands, staminal hairs, and foliar glands) using micromorphology, anatomy, histochemistry, and field observations of plant\u0013animal interactions in order to assess the functional contributions of these structures. Results show that the nectary disc and petiolar nectaries are complex working units consisting of at least epidermis and ground tissue, while the other structures are glandular trichomes. Various groups of metabolites (lipids, phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids) were detected in all structures, while starch grains were only found in the nectary disc, petiolar nectaries, and their adjacent tissues. Integrating preliminary observation of animal visitors with micromorphological, anatomical, and histochemical results, two hypotheses are proposed: (I) nectary disc and staminal hairs are important for pollination as they potentially attract and reward floral visitors, and (II) petiolar nectaries, calycinal glands, and foliar glands contribute to plant defense. Specifically, petiolar nectaries and calycinal glands provide protection from herbivores via guard ants, while calycinal and foliar glands may use plant metabolites to help prevent tissue damage from dehydration and insolation.",

    "abstract": "*[The ecology of Formica exsectoides was assessed throughout lowbush blueberry during a 4-year study.  Foraging workers collected a variety of prey species with Hymenoptera & Lepidoptera being the most common groups.  Foragers traveled several meters (7-18 m) in a wide range of temperatures (14-35degrees C) & had little impact on other predators.  Laboratory studies demonstrated that colonies feed readily on blueberry flea beetle larvae & spanworm larvae, (2 major blueberry pests).  Colonies fed continuously on flea beetle larvae as densities increased.  Carbon & nitrogen isotopic signatures were statistically similar for F. exsectoides & spiders, corroborating observations that this species is a major predator throughout blueberry.  These results indicate F. exsectoides is an efficient predator throughout lowbush blueberry that has little impact on other beneficial arthropods, thus efforts to conserve colonies should be made.  Physical characteristics of ant mounds were evaluated & mound temperatures as they relate to air & soil temperatures, & the role of colonies in increasing soil nutrients were examined.  A 6-year survey of lowbush blueberry fields was conducted to determine ant species diversity & richness.  Results indicated that fields with no chemical pesticide applications had significantly greater species richness & greater abundance of F. exsectoides.  The edges & wooded areas surrounding fields had significantly greater species richness with F. exsectoides being most common on field edges.  High densities of weedy vegetation were significantly correlated with increased densities of F. exsectoides, indicating a need for vegetation that supports honeydew-producing homopterans.  In laboratory studies, workers were sensitive to phosmet, a highly toxic insecticide commonly sprayed throughout blueberry fields.  Low toxicity insecticides such as acetamiprid & imidacloprid had little impact on worker survival in laboratory studies.  Conservation of species diversity & F. exsectoides colonies may be accomplished through the reduction & judicious selection of insecticides, as well as allowing weedy vegetation growth throughout fields.]",

We found that ants benefited from cultivating plants in full sun, receiving 7.5-fold more floral food rewards compared to shade-cultivated plants.  The higher reward levels correlated with higher levels of crop protection provided by the ants.  However, while high-light planting yielded the greatest immediate food rewards, sun-grown crops contained less nitrogen compared to shade-grown crops.

We compiled an up-to-date list of ant domatium-bearing plants, estimated their probable true number from model-based statistical inference, generated dated phylogenies that include c. 50% of ant-plant lineages, and traced the occurrence of domatia and extrafloral nectaries on a 1181-species tree, using likelihood and Bayesian methods.  We found 681 vascular plants with domatia (159 genera in 50 families) resulting from minimally 158 inferred domatium origins and 43 secondary losses over the last 19 Myr. The oldest African ant-plant symbioses are younger than those in Australasia and the Neotropics. The best statistical model suggests that the true number of myrmecophytes may approach 1140 species.  The phylogenetic distribution of ant-plants shows that domatia evolved from a range of pre-adapted morphological structures and have been lost frequently, suggesting that domatia have no generalizable effect on diversification.

Using isotope\u0010labelled mineral and organic nitrogen, we show that specialised ants actively and exclusively fertilise hyperabsorptive warts on the inner walls of plant\u0010formed structures (domatia) where they nest, sharply contrasting with nitrogen provisioning by ants in nonfarming generalist symbioses. Similar hyperabsorptive warts have evolved repeatedly in lineages colonised by farming ants. Our study supports the idea that millions of years of ant agriculture have remodelled plant physiology, shifting from ant\u0010derived nutrients as by\u0010products to active and targeted fertilisation on hyperabsorptive sites. The increased efficiency of ant\u0010derived nutrient provisioning appears to stem from a combination of farming ant behaviour and plant \u0018crop\u0019 traits.",

Ontogenetic analyses of our focal species and their relatives revealed a 25\u0010fold increase in nectary size and delayed fruit development in the ant\u0010rewarding species, and Bayesian analyses of several traits showed the correlated evolution of sugar rewards and symbiosis specialization.

    "abstract": "*[We report data showing that ants are important agents of secondary seed dispersal in the largest South American savanna, the cerrado.  Ants interacted with fallen diaspores of many plants primarily dispersed by vertebrate frugivores.  Ants often cleaned the seeds from fruit matter, what increased seed germination.   The seeds of Erythroxylum pelleterianum (Erythroxylaceae), Xylopia aromatica (Annonaceae) and Miconia rubiginosa (Melastomataceae) are primarily dispersed by birds, but most fruits fall to the ground under the parent tree.  Ants removed a considerable number of fallen diaspores of these plants, and provided directed dispersal to nutrient-enriched microsites where seedling survival was increased, as shown for E. pelleterianum.  However, this benefit sometimes is attained at the cost of significant seed loss to granivorous ants, as in the case of Xylopia aromatica.  Birds are likely responsible for long-distance dispersal & colonization of new patches, while ants reshape the seed shadow at a finer scale, delivering seeds to specific sites where seedling survival is more likely.  Although most ant taxa were generalist in relation to diaspore traits, leaf-cutter ants showed a preference pattern for some diaspores, particularly carbohydrate-rich ones.  We suggest that such preference may be driven by the chemically-protected plant leaves of the cerrado, which would constrain leaf-cutter ants to rely on fleshy fruits for fungus culturing inside their nests.  Finally, we showed that ant-diaspore interactions are susceptible to edge effects, which decrease benefits obtained by plants secondarily dispersed by ants.]",

    "abstract": "Ants inhabiting ant-plants can respond to cues of herbivory, such as the presence of herbivores, leaf damage, and plant sap, but experimental attempts to quantify the dynamic nature of biotic defenses have been restricted to a few associations between plants and ants. We studied the relationship between certain features of the ant-shrub Maieta poeppigii Cogn. (Melastomataceae) and the presence or absence of ant patrolling on the leaf surface in plants occupied by the ant Pheidole minutula Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). We also carried out field experiments to examine ant behavior following plant damage, and the potential cues that induce ant recruitment. These experiments included clipping of the leaf apex, as well as the presentation of a potential herbivore (live termite worker) and a foliar extract from Maieta on treatment leaves. The presence of ants patrolling the leaves of M. poeppigii is influenced by the number of domatia on the plant. Ant patrolling on the leaves of M. poeppigii was constant throughout a 24 h cycle, but the mean number of patrolling ants decreased from young to mature leaves, and from leaves with domatia to those without domatia. There was an overall increase in the number of ants on experimental leaves following all treatments, compared to control leaves. Visual and chemical cues associated with herbivory are involved in the induction of ant recruitment in the Maieta-Pheidole system. The continuous patrolling behavior of ants, associated with their ability to respond rapidly to foliar damage, may result in the detection and repellence/capture of most insect herbivores before they can inflict significant damage to the leaves.",

    "abstract": "The scale at which seed dispersal operates has many implications for the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and diversity. We investigated the effect of short- (ants) and long-distance (birds) seed dispersal of the fleshy-fruited melastome, Miconia rubiginosa, in the Brazilian savanna. We estimated the contribution of dispersal vectors to the removal of the fruit crop from the canopy (birds), and once seeds have reached the cerrado floor (ants) over two fruiting seasons. Birds (13 species) removed up to 23.7% of the fruit crop from the crown, but dropped a substantial proportion of fruits beneath the parent plant. Birds removed a greater proportion of fruits from trees producing large fruit crops, as predicted by the fruit crop size hypothesis. However, up to 18.9% of the fruit crop fell beneath the parent plant as ripe fruit. Most fallen fruits were removed by ants (seven genera), which are likely to play a relatively important role in terms of the quantity of seeds dispersed, especially for plants producing small fruit crops (a conceptual model is presented). Birds and ants did not influence seed germination, but they differ in terms of the spatial scale of dispersal and deposition patterns. Ants probably play an important role in the local population dynamics of Miconia, whereas birds are responsible for long-distance dispersal associated with the colonization of new patches and metapopulation dynamics. By removing seeds from bird droppings, ants may also reshape at a finer scale the seed rain generated by primary dispersers. Indeed, seedlings and saplings of Miconia are more frequently found around leaf-cutter ant nests than in control areas away from ant nests or around large Miconia trees. The quantitative component of dispersal effectiveness by ants acting as \"rescuers\" of seeds that fail to be dispersed, or fall under parent trees, is probably more important than currently recognized in other systems.",

The inner portion of cerrado was likely to be moister than its borders, but seed production & germination did not differ between edge & interior of cerrado.  Ants removed more seeds near fragment edges than at the interior.  However, Myrmicinae ants dominated ant-fruit interactions at edges.  These ants are likely to provide few benefits to the seeds.  Seedlings of E. pelleterianum growing close to Ponerinae ant nests showed higher survival than seedlings growing away from nests in the interior of cerrado, but such effect disappeared near edges.  Widespread seedling mortality due to a higher evaporative demand at edges may partially account for this effect.

    "abstract": "Myrmecochory is a facultative, mutualistic interaction in which ants receive a proteinrich food reward (elaiosome) in return for dispersing plant seeds. In North American northeastern hardwood forests, Aphaenogaster ants are the primary genus dispersing myrmecochorous plants. In these forests, myrmecochores occur in plant guilds of understory spring ephemerals or seasonal greens. This mutualism has been demonstrated tor Aphaenogaster rudis (Emery) and individual plant species, but it has not been demonstrated for other Aphaenogaster species or guilds of myrmecochores as they naturally occur. Aphaenogaster picea (Wheeler) colonies were fed three treatments over 5 mo: 1) a mixture of only elaiosomes from an entire plant guild, 2) a diet of only insect protein and 3) a combination diet of both elaiosomes and insect protein. This experiment investigated two potential hypotheses through which elaiosomes can benefit ants: 1) elaiosome proteins can substitute for protein nutritional requirements when ants are prey-limited, and 2) elaiosome nutrition can supplement insect protein when prey is ample. First, a mixture of elaiosomes from four myrmecochorous plant species provided to A. picea colonies was sufficient to maintain worker production, larval growth, and fat stores when no other food was available. A. picea colonies consuming elaiosomes as their only protein source could be sustained for a growing season (5 mo). Second, colonies fed both elaiosomes and protein did not yield more productive colonies than a control diet of just insect protein. These results support the hypothesis that myrmecochory is indeed a facultative mutualism in which ants take advantage of the protein content of elaiosomes when it is favorable, but when they are not limited by insect prey they do not gain any additional benefit from elaiosomes.",

Both species provide pearl bodies & potential nesting space or shelter for ants in dried out & hollow root swellings.

As a result, Pachycentria constricta grows in ant gardens, together with Hoya.  P. glauca is frequently found growing on Hydnophytum & Dischidia.  Both species might increase the fitness of the community in which they live by the provision of food in form of pearl bodies & by water storage in their root swellings.

Though the stability of mutualisms in the presence of such parasites is under intensive investigation, we have little information on life history traits that allow a species to be a successful mutualist or rather a parasite, particularly in cases where both are closely related. We studied the exploitation of Acacia myrmecophytes by the ant, Pseudomyrmex gracilis, contrasting with the mutualistic ant Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus. P. gracilis showed no host-defending behavior and had a negative effect on plant growth. By preventing the mutualist from colonization, P. gracilis imposes opportunity costs on the host plant. P. gracilis produced smaller colonies with a higher proportion of alates than did the mutualist and thus showed an \"r-like\" strategy. This appears to be possible because P. gracilis relies less on host-derived food resources than does the mutualist, as shown by behavioral and stable isotope studies. We discuss how this system allows the identification of strategies that characterize parasites of mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "The population dynamics of Sclerocactus mesae-verdae were documented annually in 3 plots over 20 years in southwestern Colorado. Demographic studies of this duration are rare but they are necessary to gain a more accurate estimate of population trends in long-lived desert species. Sclerocactus mesae-verdae was federally listed as threatened in 1979; this study was initiated in 1986 with the objective of determining whether Colorado populations were growing, declining, or stable. Data collected yearly around 1 May included diameter, vigor, and flower/fruit counts for 1629 stems belonging to 659 plants. We used regression analysis to estimate the mean, variance, and average population growth rate for each plot. Observations made throughout the study suggested that the cactus responded strongly to climatic variables, especially precipitation and temperature, and that 2 of the 3 subject populations were subject to periodic devastation by a longhorn beetle (Moneilema semipunctatum). These observations led us to attempt to correlate significant mortality (beetle-caused) or recruitment events to climate variables. We found that the cactus populations appear to be roughly stable to increasing slightly, possibly due to several wet springs and warmer-than-average winter temperatures since 1992. However, the warming trend also favors beetle predation, which overall presents a concern for the species' long-term survival. We conclude that 20 years may not be long enough to clarify large-scale climate influences on the persistence of long-lived desert species.

Three main treatments: 'P. nigra alone', 'P. nigra without ants and with ant food' and 'P. nigra with ants and ant food' were applied. After one growing season, we tested differences in branching length and biomass of stems, roots and leaves. Certain genotypes showed significant differences in growth, but there were no significant differences in stem length, dry mass of stems and roots between the three treatments. The total biomass of poplars after the first growing season was positively affected by the initial size of the cuttings and was modulated by the genotype independently from the treatments. However, an increased poplar growth for the treatment without ants and with ant food was observed according to significant differences in dry weight of leaves and total biomass (i.e. dry mass of stems, roots and leaves) for the pooled genotypes across treatments.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Herbivores specialized in consuming ant-defended plants evolve strategies to prevent the attack of ant workers. When the plant can associate with more than one ant species, the herbivore evasion strategies may either be species-specific, or flexible enough to successfully deter workers of different ant-plant species.  Objectives: We studied the behavior of an herbivore bug (Piezogaster reclusus) on ant-defended acacia trees (Vachellia collinsii), which associates with one of three mutualistic Pseudomyrmex ant species, and report the geographical distribution of the acacia bug species of Costa Rica and Panama.  Methods: We tested whether herbivore bugs (1) associate with a particular ant species; (2) use chemical or behavioral strategies to evade the ant workers; (3) adjust the evasion strategy to the ant species living on the acacia tree. We also compared collected acacia bugs with Museum specimens to clarify the identification from Costa Rica and Panama.  Results: We found bugs more often on trees with ants, particularly Ps. spinicola, and never on trees with Ps. nigrocinctus. To avoid ant attacks, bugs use evasive behaviors to prevent encounters with the ant workers, that depended on the ant species. Also, indirect evidence of intra and interspecific transfer experiments suggest species-specific chemical camouflage or repellence. We also report an expansion of the Southern limit of Pi. reclusus distribution in Central Panama, and reduced the distribution of Pi. chontalesis to the Chiriqu\u00cc region.  Conclusions: Similar to herbivores specialized on chemically defended plants, herbivores on ant-defended trees could evolve specific mechanisms to deal with the plant defenses. However, plants associated with multiple partners are a challenge to herbivore specialization, and might require behavioral plasticity, as our evidence suggests.

    "abstract": "CONTEXT: The effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity involve a series of mechanisms and processes that cannot be studied in isolation, mainly because human-modified landscapes are spatially heterogeneous. Despite the recent evidence on how habitat quality and landscape structure may regulate species composition and community structure, there is no empirical information on how ant\u0013plant co-occurrence networks respond to landscape changes. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we used tools derived from landscape ecology and graph theory to model how habitat loss and forest fragmentation affect ant\u0013plant co-occurrence networks at two different spatial levels (local and landscape) in a human-modified tropical rainforest in Mexico. Methods We sampled ant\u0013plant co-occurrence networks in 16 landscapes and calculated species and co-occurrence diversity as well as the specialisation of the networks. For each landscape, we measured a series of biotic and abiotic variables at the local level and another set of variables at the landscape level. RESULTS: We found that the landscape context (i.e. forest cover and landscape heterogeneity) was a better predictor of plant diversity and diversity of ant\u0013plant co-occurrences compared with local characteristics. Moreover, we also observed that network specialisation was positively related to the amount of forest cover in landscapes. CONCLUSIONS: In short, our results highlight the importance of studying the diversity of species and co-occurrence networks within a landscape approach to predict the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation at different spatial levels and contexts.          *[ Acanthoponera minor misspelled Achantoponera minor.]",

    "abstract": "Herbivory has been shown to have prominent top\u0010down effects on vegetation in Paleotropical savannas, where consumers of early stages of life history act as demographic bottlenecks. Such impact has been largely ignored in Neotropical savannas, however, despite insect consumption being linked to reduced recruitment of woody species. We hypothesize that Atta leaf\u0010cutter ants - the prevalent herbivores in the Neotropics - alter the establishment of woody plant seedlings in the Brazilian Cerrado by reducing seed availability and seedling survival. We also hypothesize that the demographic effects will be species\u0010specific. To test these hypotheses, we experimentally (i) compared seed removal in areas with and without Atta foraging and (ii) compared the survivorship of seedlings exposed to or protected from Atta foraging. Both experiments were performed with the same common Cerrado species which allowed us to evaluate the potential net effects of consumers at the population and community levels. Overall seed removal rates in sites with Atta foraging were greater than those where ants were absent (59.2% and 39.2% of seeds removed, respectively). There were differences in removal for 10 of the 12 tested species, with per species removal 1.1\u0010 to 3.8\u0010fold greater in areas with Atta foraging. On transplanted plants, 45% of seedlings exposed to Atta were attacked, resulting in a survival 7.6% lower than that of protected seedlings. Seedling survival was 11.8-31.5% lower in five species, with the largest differences in survival between treatments during the dry season. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that consumers can lead to demographic bottlenecks in Neotropical savanna plant species, with effects varying among life\u0010history stages and between species. Synthesis. Granivory by ants has been linked to reduced seedling recruitment of woody species in the Brazilian Cerrado. Our results show that leaf\u0010cutter ants may largely limit early seedling establishment of woody species by reducing seed availability and seedling survival with differential species\u0010specific effects. Atta ants may therefore be acting as an ecological filter, which coupled with potential selectivity in foraging on reproductive life\u0010history stages, may ultimately influence the relative abundance of different species and hence the structure and composition of Cerrado vegetation.",

I estimate that leaf-cutter ants harvest 17.7% of the leaves produced by cerrado trees, shrubs, & vines.  This is approximately 2-3 fold more damage than is caused by all other insect herbivores combined.  Furthermore, these estimates of herbivory by leaf-cutters are higher than those calculated for tropical rain forests (range = 1.6-17%).  Given their selectivity, the frequent defoliation of attacked plants, & the heterogeneous exploration of the area surrounding their nests, leaf-cutting ants probably have a strong influence on the Cerrado vegetation.]",

Also sample plots on active nests had different vegetation patterns, less abundance, & richness of both small (height < 20 cm) & large plants (20-120 cm) on nest, when compared to the surrounding area.

In experiments on vegetation dynamics, it was possible to observe a tendency of reduction in emergence & a pronounced mortality of seedling on activite nests.

    "abstract": "Animal-plant interactions have a major influence on ecosystem structure and functioning. Understanding to what extent the temporal dynamics of interactions is determined by climate and disturbances is thus relevant to predict ecological and evolutionary outcomes in a changing world. Here, we assessed whether the temporal dynamics of ant-plant interactions in a mountainous fire-prone ecosystem is driven by seasonal variation in abiotic conditions, and to what extent fire disturbance alters this dynamic. We also examined the thermal responses of foliage-dwelling ants in order to predict the effects of seasonal oscillations of temperature on ant activity. To do so, we monitored ant-plant associations in 35 sampling plots for one year before an unmanaged fire has occurred. Then, 26 burned and nine unburned plots were monitored for another year after fire. We found that warmer and wetter conditions let to increases in the diversity and frequency of ant-plant interactions, mainly via upturns in plant resource availability and ant foraging activity. Beyond the positive effects of temperature on interaction networks, however, ant species exhibited a low heterogeneity and a huge overlap in thermal niches. Moreover, fire has led to short-term negative effects on the diversity and frequency of interactions in ant-plant networks. In spite of it, these network metrics in burned plots took up to half a year to return to similar levels from unburned plots, highlighting the resilience of ant-plant interactions after fire disturbances. This study shows that wide thermal niches of ant species and fire resilience likely beget ant-plant networks reliability over seasons. The high overlap and broad thermal niches of ant species interacting with plant resources suggest that ant diversity plays a minor role in the tolerance against climatic changes in this fire-adapted community. These findings open a new pathway to explore thermal responses of species and their ecological interactions in broader gradients of environmental conditions and ecosystem disturbances. We advocate that long-term studies comprising assisted burnings are desirable to forecast the impact of fire regimes and how their synergy with climate would affect the functioning of fire-prone ecosystems. Lastly, this study adds evidence that studied interaction networks can be useful to monitor the impacts of environmental changes such as anthropogenic disturbances, being representative of many even more complex species interactions in ecosystems.",

The emerging field of nutritional geometry (NG) can help visualize these challenges, as well as the foraging solutions exhibited by insects. Social insect species must also make these decisions while integrating social information (e.g., provisioning kin) and/or offsetting nutrients provisioned to, or received from unrelated mutualists. In this review, we extend the logic of NG to make predictions about how cognitive challenges ramify across these social dimensions. Focusing on ants, we outline NG predictions in terms of fundamental and realized nutritional niches, considering when ants interact with related nestmates and unrelated bacterial, fungal, plant, and insect mutualists. The nutritional landscape framework we propose provides new avenues for hypothesis testing and for integrating cognition research with broader eco-evolutionary principles.",

    "abstract": "The results of ecological interactions depend on the costs and benefits involved in different ecological contexts. Turnera subulata is a shrubby plant with extrafloral nectaries that are associated with ants. Here, we test the hypotheses that the association between T. subulata and ants results in: (i) positive effects on host plant growth and reproduction; (ii) plant herbivory reduction and (iii) inhibition of the host plant visitation by beneficial organisms. Thirty experimental plots were established in northeastern Brazil, either in association with ants or without ants (N = 15 plots/treatment), with four plants each (total 120 plants). Vegetative growth (plant height and number of leaves), reproductive investment (flowers and fruits), herbivory rates and numbers of beneficial visitors were quantified during all phenological stages of the host plant. Data were analysed using generalized linear mixed models. At the host plant maturation stage, we found a trade\u0010off between growth and reproduction. Plants with ants had lower mean height; however, they invested more in reproduction (a higher number of flowers and fruits) compared to plants without ants. During the flowering stage, the abundance of sucking herbivores was higher in plots without ants but chewing herbivore abundance increased in the maturation stage in plots with ants. The cumulative proportion of leaves with herbivore damage did not differ between treatments, and the presence of ants reduced the number of beneficial visitors (e.g. pollinators and natural enemies) to the host plants. Our results show that association with ants results in some costs for the host plant, however, these costs appear to be offset by the defensive role of ants, which favours plant reproductive investment. In general, our results help to elucidate mechanisms involved in trophic interactions within the complex network of interactions involving ants and plants.          *[Pseudomyrmex simplex incorrectly listed with Myrmicinae; Pseudomyrmex simplex is in the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae.]",

The oak forest network comprises 47 plant species & 11 ant species, while the induced grassland network has 35 & 13, respectively.

The ant-plant network of the induced grassland was significantly more nested & generalist than that of the oak forest; however, none of the networks were nested when considering the frequency of interaction.  In both vegetation types, the ants were more specialized than the plants, & niche overlap was low.  This could be related to the dominant species present in each type of vegetation: Prenolepis imparis in the oak forest & Camponotus rubrithorax in the grassland.  The central core of cold climate ant species in the oak forest was replaced by a central core of subordinate Camponotini & tropical specialists in the induced grassland.

Previous experimental studies at a few locations in South Africa indicated that Ficus sur indirectly benefited from the presence of Hilda patruelis (Homoptera: Tettigometridae) because it attracted ants (primarily Pheidole megacephala) that reduced the effects of both pre-dispersal ovule gallers & parasitoids of pollinating wasps.  Data on 429 trees distributed among 5 countries indicated that 20 of 38 Ficus species, & 46% of all trees sampled, had ants on their figs.  Members of the Sycomorus subgenus were significantly more likely to attract ants than those in the Urostigma subgenus, and ant-colonization levels on these species were significantly greater than for Urostigma species.  On average, each ant-occupied F. sur tree had 37% of its fig crop colonized by ants, whereas the value was 24% for other Ficus species.  H. patruelis was the most common source for attracting ants, although figs were also attacked by a range of other ant-tended homopterans.  P. megacephala was significantly more common on figs than other ant species, being present on 58% of sampled trees.  Ant densities commonly exceeded 4.5 per fig, which a field experiment indicated was sufficient to provide protection from ovule gallers & parasitoids of pollinators.  Forty-nine percent of all colonized F. sur trees sampled had ant densities equal to or greater than 4.5 per fig, whereas this value was 23% for other Ficus species.]",

    "abstract": "Four species of fast-growing pioneer tree species in the genus Cecropia exist in the forests in central Panama. Cecropia insignis is dominant in old-growth forests but absent from nearby secondary forests; C. obtusifolia, and C. peltata are abundant in secondary forests but rare in old-growth forest, and C. longipes is uncommon in both. To determine whether Cecropia habitat associations are a consequence of local dispersal or differences in recruitment success, we grew seedlings of these species in common gardens in large treefall gaps in secondary and old-growth forest. In contrast to the observed adult distribution, only C. insignis grew significantly over 16 months in secondary forests; remaining species were heavily browsed by herbivores. C. insignis also grew and survived best in old-growth forest. Differences in susceptibility to herbivory did not result from an ant defence mutualism; none of the plants were colonised by ants during the experiment. To test whether C. insignis, the species least susceptible to herbivory, trades off investment in growth in favour of defence, we also grew the four Cecropia species in a screened growing house under light conditions comparable to large forest gaps. Contrary to expectation, species growth rates were similar; only C. peltata grew significantly faster than C. insignis. These results suggest that (1) conditions in ~40-year-old secondary forests no longer support the recruitment of Cecropia species, which are canopy dominants there; and (2) among congeners, differences in plant traits with little apparent cost to growth can have large impacts on recruitment by affecting palatability to herbivores.",

    "abstract": "Cocoa is produced in a wide range of land use systems, with the traditional shaded systems in Bahia (Brazil) as the most forest-like and biodiverse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of different cocoa agroforestry systems (AFSs) in maintaining community structure and interactions between ants and epiphytic bromeliads. The study was conducted at four sites in the cocoa producing region of the southeastern of the state of Bahia, Brazil, and comprised a native forest and three different cocoa AFSs. We found a total of 103 ant species associated with epiphytic bromeliads, with 83% of the species occurring in native forest canopy bromeliads also occurring in cocoa AFSs. The Cocoa Cabruca System (CAB) and the Rustic-Planted Shade System (RPS) had ant community structural components of biodiversity similar to those found in the native forest environment. The alpha and gamma diversity of ants found in Monospecific-Shaded Cocoa Agroforestry System (MCA) associated with Erythrina spp. shade trees were significantly different from the diversity found in the other AFSs and native forest. The presence of epiphytic bromeliads, regardless of the system and scale, maintained ant diversity in agroforestry system canopies similar to that of native forest. Using metrics derived from graph theory, we found a high level of specialization regarding ant-bromeliad interactions in native forest, with a gradual decrease in specialization with environmental homogenization. Agroforestry systems thus represent an important strategy for maintaining the structure of canopy-associated ant communities by enabling the establishment of numerous bromeliad species, thus contributing to the maintenance of ant diversity and services in a mosaic landscape AFSs and native forest.",

Ants generally forage for flowers in quest of nectar & other sustenance, & in doing so they pollinate the flowers that they encounter.  This review identified the pollination networks between ants & plants at the species & family levels.  Pollination is often affected by a number of aspects, including the flower's sex, its ovary position, the inflorescence it bears, & the time of year.  The available literature demonstrates that ants visit the inflorescences of the same species only to promote cross-pollination, a process known as 'geitonogamy'; however, we conclude that ants may visit different inflorescences of different plants in the field.  If ant pollination is the norm, there is less selection pressure to acquire self-compatibility; nonetheless, ants' cross-pollination may have caused ants to co-evolve with the pollinating flowers.

We observed that the secretory activity of nectaries of P. laevigata appeared to follow the predictions of the 'Optimal Defense Theory'. Specifically, our results suggest that due to high temperature and low humidity during the day, nectaries were more active at night, precisely when herbivores and ants were more abundant. Moreover, protective ants were always more abundant in the apical zones of the branches where youngest leaves are most susceptible to attack by herbivores. We hypothesized that P. laevigata could be optimizing nectar secretion in order to allocate defenses to maximize their individual fitness. Our study contributes to our understanding of how Optimal Defense Theory could shape multitrophic interactions between ants, plants, and herbivores mediated by secretory activity of nectaries in arid environments.          *[The main herbivores found in both sampling periods included leaf-cutting ants (22.9%).]",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the number of studies dealing with how species interaction networks are structured by landscape has increased in the literature. However, many studies quantify landscape metrics at one single spatial extent, without considering the effects at multiple spatial extents. To the best of our knowledge, no study has explicitly addressed and discussed the spatial extent at which landscape structure best predicts the organization of ecological networks, which is key to understanding how ecological interactions are affected by landscape modifications. Therefore, two important research questions arise: can the spatial scale at which landscape structure best predicts an ecological response (i.e., scale of effect) magnify our ability to understand ecological networks or can the suboptimal scale just blind our view about what really happens? Motivated by these concerns, we used ant-plant relationships obtained from 16 landscapes in a human-dominated tropical rainforest of Mexico to assess and discuss the spatial extent at which forest cover (%) best predicts ant-plant interaction network patterns (i.e., network size, interaction diversity, network specialization, and nestedness). In general, we observed that smaller scales best predicted the interaction diversity (50 m) and specialization (250 m) of ecological networks involving ants and plants, which are descriptors associated to abundance and the distribution of interactions between plant and ant species. This is possibly because ant-plant relationships are being modulated by processes that act at the microclimatic level due to the biotic and abiotic conditions that forest provides. However, we found that network size and nestedness (i.e., descriptors associated to species detectability and emergent properties) were not associated with forest cover at any analyzed spatial extent. These findings indicate that the ant-plant ecological network structure can be influenced by processes that occur at different spatial extents. Moreover, the results presented here have a direct impact on our theoretical and empirical understanding of how the landscape structure shapes biotic interactions at different spatial extents in highly diverse tropical rainforests.           *[Here, we used a previously published dataset by our research group in Corro et al. (2019), where we conducted sampling of ant-plant ecological networks in 16 landscapes in a human-dominated tropical rainforest of Mexico.]",

    "abstract": "Extrafloral nectar (EFN) is a predictable and renewable resource for many ant colonies, and different ant species compete strongly to obtain and monopolize this highly nutritious food resource. Despite the importance of competition in structuring patterns of ant-plant interactions, this biological mechanism has been largely ignored in studies involving ant-plant networks. In this study we investigate the role of ant dominance hierarchy in structuring an ecological network involving ants and EFN-bearing plants in a tropical coastal environment in Mexico. We show that within a nested ant-plant network, ant species found in the central core of highly interacting species were competitively superior, showing massive recruitment and resource domination, compared with peripheral species with fewer interactions. Moreover, we also observed that both central and peripheral ant species have the ability to quickly find the food resource. However, after 2\th of observation, central ant species are more frequently collected on the food resource when compared with peripheral species. We hypothesize that the existence of a central core of competitive ant species may indicate that most plant species found within ant-plant networks could be better protected against herbivory by these dominant ant species. In short, our results highlight the importance of competition and monopolization in the resource use by ants in the maintenance of the nested pattern in ant-plant mutualistic networks.  \u00a9 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 113, 405-414.",

    "abstract": "In closed\u0010canopy tropical forest understory, light availability is a significant determinant of habitat diversity because canopy structure is highly variable in most tropical forests. Consequently, variation in canopy cover affects the composition and distribution of plant species via creating variable light environments. Nevertheless, little is known about how variation in canopy openness structures patterns of plant-animal interactions. Because of the great diversity and dominance of ants in tropical environments, we used ant-plant interactions as a focal network to evaluate how variation in canopy cover influences patterns of plant-insect interactions in the Brazilian Amazon rain forest. We observed that small increases in canopy openness are associated with increased diversity of ant-plant interactions in our study area, and this change is independent of plant or ant species richness. Additionally, we found smaller niche overlap for both ants and plants associated with greater canopy openness. We hypothesize that enhanced light availability increases the breadth of ant foraging sources because variation in light availability gives rise to plant resources of different quality and amounts. Moreover, greater light availability promotes vegetative growth in plants, creating ant foraging 'bridges' between plants. In sum, our results highlight the importance of environmental heterogeneity as a determinant of ant-plant interaction diversity in tropical environments.          **Pachycondyla misspelled Pachycondila.",

Using continuous daily sampling of ants visiting 3 plant species in the Brazilian Neotropical savanna, we evaluated for the first time the topological structure over 24 h & species-area relationships (based on the number of extrafloral nectaries available) in individual-based ant-plant networks.  We observed that diurnal & nocturnal ant-plant networks exhibited the same pattern of interactions: a nested & non-modular pattern & an average level of network specialization.  Despite the high similarity in the ants' composition between the 2 collection periods, ant species found in the central core of highly interacting species totally changed between diurnal & nocturnal sampling for all plant species. I n other words, this 'night-turnover' suggests that the ecological dynamics of these ant-plant interactions can be temporally partitioned (day & night) at a small spatial scale.  Thus, it is possible that in some cases processes shaping mutualistic networks formed by protective ants & plants may be underestimated by diurnal sampling alone.  Moreover, we did not observe any effect of the number of extrafloral nectaries on ant richness & their foraging on such plants in any of the studied ant-plant networks.]",

However, the spatial effect has only recently been incorporated as a factor structuring mutualistic networks. In this study, we evaluated how the topological structure and species turnover of ant-plant mutualistic networks vary over a spatial gradient. We showed that although the ant and plant composition of networks changed over space, the central core of generalist species and the structure of networks remained unaltered on a geographic distance of up to 5099 m in the southern Brazilian Amazon. This finding indicates that independently of variation in local and landscape environmental factors, the nonrandom pattern organization of these interacting assemblages do not change. Finally, we suggest that a stable core can increase the potential for coevolutionary convergence of traits among species from both sides of the interaction within the community. These findings contribute to our understanding of the maintenance of biodiversity and coevolutionary processes.",

Recent studies posit that most of the organization of mutualistic networks is shaped by differences in species abundance among interacting species. In this study, we examined the mutualism involving plants with extrafloral nectaries and their associated ants. We show empirically that the difference in abundance among ants on vegetation partially explains the network structure of mutualistic interactions and that it is independent of ant species compositions: an ant species that is abundant usually interacts with more plant species. Moreover, nested networks are generated by simple variation in ant abundance on foliage. However, in ant-plant mutualistic networks, nestedness was higher than in networks describing the occurrence of ants on plants without a food resource. Additionally, the plant and ant species with the highest number of interactions within these networks interacted more among themselves than expected under the assumption of an abundance\u0010based, random mixing of individuals. We hypothesize that the dominance of these ant species occurs because these ants are able to outcompete other ant species when feeding on extrafloral nectaries and because of the presence of ecophysiological adaptations to utilize liquid food.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies have focused on structural properties of ant-plant networks. However, little is known about the role of abiotic factors on these networks. As a result of different abiotic factors that can affect the patterns of ant-plant interactions, it was tested whether soil pH and canopy cover contribute to variation in the nestedness of mutualistic (plants with extrafloral nectar-EFN) and neutral (plants without EFN) ant-plant networks. It was shown that only mutualistic networks were affected by soil pH. It was suggested that this may occur because the variation in soil pH directly influences the secreted nectar, and as there is a preference for nectar composition by ants, this could change the patterns of interaction in mutualistic networks. As prey availability is possibly the main factor influencing ants' presence on plants without EFN, soil pH should have little or no influence on the patterns of interaction in neutral networks. On the other hand, nestedness was not affected by canopy cover in mutualistic and neutral networks. In spite of that canopy cover (light availability) is directly related to the amount of nectar secreted, the volume of nectar may not be important for the structure of the networks. However, canopy cover varied little in this study site. This small variation could not be enough to change the nested pattern in mutualistic and neutral networks. In short, the present results show that the abiotic factors that affect the availability and quality of food resources may have important effects on the structure of trophic interactions in non-symbiotic ant-plant networks.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown that qualitative (binary) ant-plant networks are highly nested in tropical environments, in which specialist species (with fewer interactions) are connected with generalists (with the most interactions) in cohesive subgroups. Interactions occur in both qualitative and quantitative networks, however, how their frequency may structure the nestedness in ecological networks involving these organisms is, we believe, unknown. Based on this perspective, we used nestedness analysis to address the effect of interaction frequency on ant-plant networks (n = 14 networks). Unlike binary networks, quantitative networks are often significantly non-nested. In addition, species with a higher interaction frequency have a higher number of links, indicating that these species are possibly more abundant and/or competitive. Moreover, different biological parameters can change the nature of ant-plant interactions, as a plant can be a good resource for one ant and a \u0018bad\u0019 resource for another. Thus, this suggests a new perspective for the study of interaction networks in the tropics, since species with lower interaction frequency are not necessarily subsets of species with higher frequency, and consequently generate the non-nested pattern in quantitative networks.",

In fact, one of the most challenging issues in ecology is how to define suitable scales (i.e., temporal or spatial) to accurately describe and understand ecological systems. Here, we sampled a series of ant\u0013plant interaction networks in the southern Brazilian Amazon rainforest in order to determine whether the spatial sampling scale, from local to regional, affects our understanding of the structure of these networks. To this end, we recorded ant-plant interactions in adjacent 25 x 30 m subplots (local sampling scale) nested within twelve 250 x 30 m plots (regional sampling scale). Moreover, we combined adjacent or random subplots and plots in order to increase the spatial sampling scales at the local and regional levels. We then calculated commonly used binary and quantitative network\u0010level metrics for both sampling scales (i.e., number of species and interactions, nestedness, specialization and modularity), all of which encompass a wide array of structural patterns in interaction networks. We observed increasing species and interactions across sampling scales, and while most network descriptors remained relatively constant at the local level, there was more variation at the regional scale. Among all metrics, specialization was most constant across different spatial sampling scales. Furthermore, we observed that adjacent assembly did not generate more variation in network descriptor values compared to random assembly. This finding indicates that the spatially aggregated distribution of species/individuals and abiotic conditions does not affect the organization of these interacting assemblages. Our results have a direct impact on our empirical and theoretical understanding of the ecological dynamics of species interactions by demonstrating that small spatial sampling scales should suffice to record some patterns commonly found in ant-plant interaction networks in a highly diverse tropical rainforest.",

However, the cues used by ant queens to locate suitable host-plants following dispersal remain poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that Pheidole minutula queens use volatiles to distinguish their host Maieta guianensis (Melastomataceae) from other sympatric myrmecophytes. To do so, we used a Y-tube olfactometer to quantify the preference for volatiles of different plant species. Our results indicate that P. minutula queens discriminate the chemical volatiles produced by its host-plant from those of other sympatric ant-plant species. However, queens failed to distinguish the volatiles of Maieta from those of the ant-plant Tococa bullifera (Melastomataceae), with which P. minutula is not mutualistically associated. Nevertheless, a strong preference for Maieta over Tococa was observed during a subsequent bioassay, where the ants had physical contact with a domatium of each plant species. These results suggest that additional, short distance mechanisms are also necessary for host discrimination. Overall, our findings suggest that the high degree of compartmentalization observed in symbiotic ant-plant relationships is achieved, at least in part, by the relatively high degree of specificity in host selection displayed by foundress queens.",

It is believed that, to some extent, they resemble natural cycles of forest growth, decline, and regeneration and can benefit, e.g., mutualistic relations among plants and pollinators. To study the impact of forest management (clear cuts) on pollinator visitation, we focused on three ericaceous plant species, Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, and Calluna vulgaris, common elements of pine forest understory. Our observations, conducted in Lithuania, showed that there are no differences among control mature stands and clear cut areas in terms of visitation frequency for all three studied species. However, at least for C. vulgaris, a shift toward fly visits was observed in the clear cut site, showing that open areas are preferred habitats for these insects. Ants constituted an important share of visitors to flowers of V. myrtillus and C. vulgaris, suggesting their important role in reproduction of these plant species.          *[Over 95% of the video-recorded visits were by ants (Formicidae), which fed on nectar.]",

    "abstract": "In a census taken in Peru's Manu National Park, 10 epiphytic angiosperms from seven plant families established principally on arboreal carton-ant nests. These \"ant gardens\" (AGs) were most often inhabited by parabiotic ants, Camponotus femoratus and Crematogaster cf. limata parabiotica, whose polygynous and polydomous colonies fissioned to form extensive AG aggregations. AGs tended by polydomous but probably monogynous Azteca cf. traili occurred on average in smaller isolates. All three ant species enriched nest gardens with vertebrate feces, but frequencies of occurrence of most AG epiphytes were lower on the less organic carton of Azteca AGs. Interspecific differences in epiphyte abundance and distribution were related to light requirements of plants and to colonizing abilities, as influenced by differences in allocational preferenda and life history. AG aggregations occupied 16-39% of five forest habitat types present and were especially common in frequently flooded habitats and areas of high light intensity. Patchy distribution was explained partly by overrepresentation on resource trees, such as Inga and Calyptranthes (parabiotic ants) and Cordia nodosa (Azteca). Habitat associations did not result from reduction of the terrestrial ant fauna in flooded forests. Other arboreal ants, but not terrestrial ants, were markedly lower in AG aggregations than in areas that lacked AGs, perhaps due to competition from aggressive and dominant AG ants. AGs formed principally by directed dispersal of epiphyte seeds to ant nests, where larvae fed on seed attachments without damaging seeds. AG ants also recognized and retrieved seeds of at least one AG epiphyte from feces of vertebrate fruit dispersers. The preference ranking of epiphyte seeds by Ca. femoratus was not correlated with either obvious differences in quality of seed appendages or long-term resource potential of plants. Seeds of AG epiphytes were rejected by three ants that do not tend AGs but were collected by a fourth such species. Seed attractiveness may depend in part on nonnutritional cues. Preadaptations of plants and ants appear to have been very important to the origin of AGs. Evidence for evolutionary specialization and coadaptation is circumstantial but suggestive.",

    "abstract": "In numbers and biomass, ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) often dominate arthropod faunas of tropical rainforest canopies. Extraordinary ant abundance is due principally to one or a few species able to tap the high productivity of canopy foliage by feeding on plant and homopteran exudates. Prior studies of nitrogen isotopic ratios show that exudate-feeders derive much of their nitrogen (N) by processing large quantities of N-poor, but carbohydrate (CHO)-rich, exudates. CHOs in excess of those that can be coupled with protein for growth and reproduction (postulated as the colony's first priorities) may be directed at little cost and some profit to functions that increase access to limiting protein. High dietary CHO:protein ratios for exudate-feeders appear to subsidize 'high tempo' foraging activity, defence of absolute (level III) territories, and production of N-free alarm/defence exocrine products that enhance ecological dominance in contests with other ants. Among organisms (e.g. plants and Lepidoptera) symbiotic with ants, CHO:protein ratios of ant rewards may control both the identities of ant associates and the quality of ant-rendered services. Dietary ratios of CHO:protein play an important and previously unrecognized role in the ecology and evolution of ants generally. Modifications of worker digestive systems in certain ant subfamilies and genera represent key innovations for handling and processing large volumes of liquid food. The supreme tropical dominants are species released from nest site limitation and able to place their nests in the vicinity of abundant exudate resources. Polydomy appears to be typical of these species and should produce energetic savings by taking colony fragments to the resource.",

Pruning behavior occurs at higher frequency in ants with sting defenses than in those with chemical defenses, which may generally convey an advantage in aggressive encounters between ants. Experiments in tropical moist forest of Peru tested the hypothesis that pruning may reduce the threat of invasions by potentially dangerous alien ants. When unseverable contacts were made between Triplaris americana 1-3 m in height and neighboring plants, Crematogaster ants invaded more frequently and in greater numbers than on control plants and inhibited activities of behaviorally subordinate resident Pseudomyrmex dendroicus. Invaders occasionally carried away brood and usurped hollow stem nests of resident ants. Pseudomyrmex cut petioles of leaves on plants contacting their hosts as well as leaves of their own host plants, when these leaves formed bridges for major invasions. Basal clearings maintained by Pseudomyrmex around their hosts appear to reduce the likelihood that Crematogaster workers will occur in the vicinity of the tree trunk. On Cordia nodosa inhabited by Allomerus demararae, numbers of invading ants did not differ on experimental and control trees, perhaps because larger ants cannot invade through dense trichomes. Allomerus workers attacked encroaching vines only when these vines bore large numbers of Crematogaster.",

    "abstract": "A tabular survey of ant-plant symbioses worldwide summarizes aspects of the evolutionary ecology of these associations. Remarkable similarities between ant-plant symbioses in disjunct tropical regions result from convergent and parallel evolution of similarly preadapted ants and plants. Competition among ants has driven evolutionary specialization in plant-ants and is the principal factor accounting for parallelism and convergence. As habitat specialization accompanied the evolutionary radiation of many myrmecophytes, frequent host shifts and de novo colonizations by habitat-specific ants both inhibited species-specific coevolution and co-gladogenesis, and magnified the diversity of mutualistic partners. The comparatively high species diversity of neotropical plant-ants and myrmecophytes probably results from two historical factors. Most importantly, influenced by Andean orogeny, greater habitat disturbance by fluvial systems has created a mosaic of habitat types unparalleled in other tropical regions; both myrmecophytes and plant-ants have diversified across habitat boundaries. Second, the arrival of a new wave of dominant ants (especially Crematogaster) may have condensed the diversity of relatively timid plant-ants to a greater degree in Africa and Asia than in the more isolated Neotropics. Regular trajectories in the evolutionary histories of plant-ants appear to be driven principally by competition, in a manner analogous to the taxon cycles or pulses proposed for other groups.          *[with appendix: worldwide summary of all symbiontic ant-plant relationships known so far.

Experimental evidence indicates that one ant species may deterministically replace another over time on Clidemia heterophylla, but the pattern may have different explanations in other myrmecophytes. Among five myrmecophytes with long, dense stem trichomes, sizes of the most frequent ant associates are positively correlated with trichome spacing. Ants larger than a threshold body size cannot move readily through the trichomes without first cutting trail net-works.

The origin and diversification of myrmecophytism in Macaranga was investigated using phylogenetic analyses of morphological and nuclear ITS DNA characters and studies of character evolution. Despite low ITS variation, the combined analysis resulted in a well-supported hypothesis of relationships. Mapping myrmecophytism on all most parsimonious trees resulting from the combined analysis indicated that the trait evolved independently between 2 and 4 times and was lost between one and 3 times for atotal of 5 changes. This hypothesis was robust when tested against trees constrained to have 3 or fewer evolutionary transformations, although increased taxon sampling for the ITS analysis is required to confirm this. Mapping morphological traits on the phylogeny indicated that myrmecophytism was not homologous among lineages; each independent origin involved a suite of different specializations for ant-plant association. There was no evidence that myrmecophytic traits underwent sequential change through evolution; self-hollowing domatia evolved independently from ant-excavated domatia, and different food-body production types evolved in different lineages. The multiple origins of myrmecophytism in Macaranga were restricted to one small, exclusively western Malesian lineage of an otherwise large and nonmyrmecophytic genus. Although the evolution of aggregated food-body production and the formation of domatia coincided with the evolution of myrmecophytism in all cases, several morphological, ecological, and biogeographic factors appear to have facilitated and constrained this radiation of ant-plants.]",

    "abstract": "Ant-acacia mutualisms are conspicuous biotic associations in Savannah and neotropical ecosystems; however, the effects of tree size and forest structure on ant behaviour and tree traits are rarely examined. We tested two hypotheses related to these effects: (1) ant responses to disturbance are influenced by tree size and forest basal area; and (2) tree traits important to ants are predictable by tree size and forest basal area. We investigated these hypotheses in a dry tropical forest (Ometepe Island, Nicaragua) with the myrmecophytic Collins acacia (Vachellia collinsii Saff.) and the ant Pseudomyrmex spinicola (Emery 1890). We measured trees from three size classes and three basal area classes and quantified resources that are important for ants, including food resources (nectaries and Beltian bodies) and domiciles (thorns), as well as a measure of potential tree reproductive fitness (seedpods). We also evaluated ant responses to experimental disturbances. Three important findings emerged: (1) on average, 1140-1173% more ants responded to experimental disturbances of large trees than small- or intermediate-sized trees, respectively; (2) forest basal area did not affect ant responses to disturbance; and (3) neither tree size nor forest basal area was correlated with branch-level mean numbers of nectaries, food bodies or thorns. Our studies support the hypothesis that tree size is an important factor regarding ant behavioural responses to disturbance, but not forest basal area. Our work suggests that future studies of ant behaviour on myrmecophytes should consider tree size.

    "abstract": "Premise of the study: Interactions between plants and ants abound in nature and have significant consequences for ecosystem functioning. Recently, it has been suggested that nectar-foraging ants transport microorganisms to flowers; more specifically, they transport yeasts, which can potentially consume sugars and alter nectar composition. Therefore, ants could indirectly change nectar sugar profile, an important floral feature involved in the plant-pollinator mutualism. But this novel role for ants has never been tested. We here investigate the effects of nectarivorous ants and their associated yeasts on the floral nectar sugar composition of an ant-pollinated plant.  Methods: Differences in the nectar sugar composition of ant-excluded and ant-visited flowers were examined in 278 samples by using high-performance liquid-chromatography. The importance of the genetic identity and density of ant-transported basidiomycetous and ascomycetous yeasts on the variation of nectar traits was also evaluated.  Key results: Ant visitation had significant effects on nectar sugar composition. The nectar of ant-visited flowers contained significantly more fructose, more glucose, and less sucrose than the nectar of ant-excluded flowers, but these effects were context dependent. Nectar changes were correlated with the density of yeast cells in nectar. The magnitude of the effects of ant-transported ascomycetes was much higher than that of basiodiomycetes.  Conclusions: Ants and their associated yeasts induce changes in nectar sugar traits, reducing the chemical control of the plant over this important floral trait. The potential relevance of this new role for ants as indirect nectar modifiers is a rich topic for future research into the ecology of ant-flower interactions.",

    "abstract": "Chemical signals emitted by plants are crucial to understand the ecology and evolution of plant-animal interactions. Scent is an important component of floral phenotype and represents a decisive communication channel between plants and floral visitors. Floral volatiles promote attraction of mutualistic pollinators and, in some cases, serve to prevent flower visitation by antagonists such as ants. Despite ant visits to flowers have been suggested to be detrimental to plant fitness, in recent years there has been a growing recognition of the positive role of ants in pollination. Nevertheless, the question of whether floral volatiles mediate mutualisms between ants and ant-pollinated plants still remains largely unexplored. Here we review the documented cases of ant pollination and investigate the chemical composition of the floral scent in the ant-pollinated plant Cytinus hypocistis. By using chemical-electrophysiological analyses and field behavioural assays, we examine the importance of olfactory cues for ants, identify compounds that stimulate antennal responses, and evaluate whether these compounds elicit behavioural responses. Our findings reveal that floral scent plays a crucial role in this mutualistic ant-flower interaction, and that only ant species that provide pollination services and not others occurring in the habitat are efficiently attracted by floral volatiles. 4-oxoisophorone, (E)-cinnamaldehyde, and (E)-cinnamyl alcohol were the most abundant compounds in Cytinus flowers, and ant antennae responded to all of them. Four ant pollinator species were significantly attracted to volatiles emitted by Cytinus inflorescences as well as to synthetic mixtures and single antennal-active compounds. The small amount of available data so far suggest that there is broad interspecific variation in floral scent composition among ant-pollinated plants, which could reflect differential responses and olfactory preferences among different ant species. Many exciting discoveries will be made as we enter into further research on chemical communication between ants and plants.",

Our genetic analyses (= DNA microsatellites) reveal that Allomerus has a breeding system characterized by almost complete monogyny & a low frequency of polyandry.  Contrary to theoretical explanations, we find no difference in worker relatedness asymmetries between female-specialist & male-specialist colonies.  Furthermore, no clear link was found between colony sex allocation & life history traits such as the number of mates per queen, colony size, resource level, or fecundity.  We also failed to find significant support for male production by workers, infection by Wolbachia, local resource competition, or local mate competition.  We are left with the possibility that Allomerus exhibits split sex ratios because of the evolution of alternative biasing strategies in queens or workers, as recently proposed in the literature.]",

Here, we describe a novel tripartite symbiosis in which ants and a fungus inhabit domatia of an ant-plant, and present evidence that such interactions are widespread.   We investigated 139 individuals of the African ant-plant Leonardoxa africana for occurrence of fungus. Behavior of mutualist ants toward the fungus within domatia was observed using a video camera fitted with an endoscope. Fungi were identified by sequencing a fragment of their ribosomal DNA.   Fungi were always present in domatia occupied by mutualist ants but never in domatia occupied by opportunistic or parasitic ants. Ants appear to favor the propagation, removal and maintenance of the fungus. Similar fungi were associated with other ant-plants in Cameroon. All belong to the ascomycete order Chaetothyriales; those from L. africana formed a monophyletic clade.  These new plant-ant-fungus associations seem to be specific, as demonstrated within Leonardoxa and as suggested by fungal phyletic identities. Such tripartite associations are widespread in African ant-plants but have long been overlooked. Taking fungal partners into account will greatly enhance our understanding of symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms.",

It is possible that winged females seek this plant to build their society.  From this fact two hypothesis may be formulated.   First; P. villosa winged females are spontaneously attracted to Aechmea.  Second; Attraction is acquired due to an imprinting that effects during larval life and imago life before swarming.  Two lots comprising workers & winged females were tested.  In each case, the lot controlled comprised of individuals found in nature (= societies settled on Aechmea).  The tested lots were produced & bred in laboratory.  The first lot was put in contact with a piece of Schomburgkia tibicinis, while the second lot had no contact with a plant.  At the time of the experiment, each lot was faced with a choice between 2 tubes.  One contained a piece of Aechmea, the other was empty (1st series of tests), or contained a piece of Schomburgkia (2nd series of tests).   The first series of tests permits to show that controls (individuals that have contact with Aechmea in nature) settle in tubes containing a piece of Aechmea whereas individuals from the other 2 lots settle indiscriminately in either of the tubes.  The second series of tests permits to show that controls also settle in the tube containing Aechmea, that individuals raised in contact with Schomburgkia choose the tube containing this plant & that individuals raised in the absence of plant contact settle indiscriminately in either of the tubes.  The influence of the original environmental influence on individuals in the choice between 2 types of tubes is thus demonstrated.]",

The study was conducted in a hilly zone of a neotropical rainforest where two specialized myrmecophytes grow at the bottom of the slopes, another at mid-slope, and a fourth on the hilltops. Tachia guianensis, which occurred everywhere, had its own guild of associated ant species.

By visiting the CFNs, the ants indirectly protect the flowers (but not the plant foliage) from herbivorous insects.  We show that this protection is provided mostly by species nesting in dried-out stems, predominantly Pseudomyrmex gracilis.

Only Tococa, when sheltering A. bequaerti in what can be considered as a truly mutualistic relationship, showed significantly less defoliation than control plants. In the other associations, the difference was not significant, but P. minutula is mutualistic with Maieta because it furnishes some protection (exclusion experiments) plus nutrients (previous studies). When devoid of ants, Tococa showed significantly greater defoliation than control plants; therefore, it was deduced that Tococa probably lacks certain antidefoliator metabolites that control plants possess (both Tococa and control plants are protected by ground-nesting, plant-foraging ants, which is termed 'general myrmecological protection').  Consequently, plant-ants other than A. bequaerti probably also protect Tococa slightly, thus compensating for this deficiency and permitting it to live in the understory until treefall gaps provide the conditions necessary for seed production.",

The workers of all four species use a predatory behaviour involving spread-eagling alien insects after recruiting nestmates at short range, and, in some cases, at long range.

Based on the results from a field study, we show here (1) that colonies of Azteca chartifex, a territorially dominant, Neotropical arboreal ant species, mostly selected Goupia glabra (Goupiaceae) trees in which to build their principal carton nests and (2) that plant signals induced workers to recruit nestmates, which patrol the leaves, likely providing the plant with a biotic defense. Furthermore, the number of recruited workers was clearly higher on G. glabra, their most frequently selected host tree species, than on other tree species.

These obligate ant-plant mutualisms are common model systems for studying factors that allow horizontally transmitted mutualisms to persist since parasites of ant-myrmecophyte mutualisms exploit the rewards provided by host plants whilst providing no protection in return. In pioneer formations in French Guiana, Azteca alfari and Azteca ovaticeps are known to be mutualists of myrmecophytic Cecropia (Cecropia ants).  Here, we show that Azteca andreae, whose colonies build carton nests on myrmecophytic Cecropia, is not a parasite of Azteca-Cecropia mutualisms nor is it a temporary social parasite of A. alfari; it is, however, a temporary social parasite of A. ovaticeps. Contrarily to the two mutualistic Azteca species that are only occasional predators feeding mostly on hemipteran honeydew and food bodies provided by the host trees, A. andreae workers, which also attend hemipterans, do not exploit the food bodies. Rather, they employ an effective hunting technique where the leaf margins are fringed with ambushing workers, waiting for insects to alight. As a result, the host trees' fitness is not affected as A. andreae colonies protect their foliage better than do mutualistic Azteca species resulting in greater fruit production. Yet, contrarily to mutualistic Azteca, when host tree development does not keep pace with colony growth, A. andreae workers forage on surrounding plants; the colonies can even move to a non-Cecropia tree.",

In turn, it is protected from defoliators and obtains nutrients from ant-produced wastes (myrmecotrophy). Aiming to verify if seasonality influences nitrogen assimilation via ant wastes using the stable isotope nitrogen-15, we first studied Tachia\u0019s phenology and its seasonal leaf production, and then the life cycle of its two more frequent guest ant species. We found that leaf production was much higher during the rainy than the dry season. Mature guest ant colonies produced sexuals regardless of the season and the net weight of the waste piles inside the domatia did not vary between seasons, so that the availability of nutrients to their host plant is steady year-long. By providing the two most frequent mutualistic guest ant species with food enriched with nitrogen-15, we showed that Tachia individuals assimilate more nitrogen from ant wastes during the rainy season, when the plant is physiologically active, compared to the dry season. Thus, one can deduce that the increase in nitrogen assimilation during the rainy season is determined by the increase in Tachia's physiological activity during that season. Information gathered through a bibliographic compilation confirms that none of the 15 ant species known to be associated with myrmecophytes for which the life cycle was studied is characterized by seasonal reproduction (which would result in fluctuating waste production). The same is true for 49.7% of 167 tropical ant species (seasonal production for the remaining species). We concluded that, in contrast to the non-seasonal ant colony reproductive cycle, Tachia's phenology determines the myrmecotrophic assimilation rate.",

A. ovaticeps provisioned with prey and then 15N-enriched food produced more individuals than did control colonies (not artificially provisioned). This was not true for A. alfari colonies, possibly due to differences in the degree of maturity of the colonies for the chosen range of host tree sizes (less than 3m in height). Myrmecotrophy was demonstrated for both Azteca species as provisioning the ants with 15N-enriched food translated into higher delta15N values in host plant tissues, indicating that nitrogen passed from the food to the plant. Thus, the predatory activity of their guest ants benefits the Cecropia trees not only because the ants protect them from defoliators since most prey are phytophagous insects but also because the plant absorbs nutrients.",

When they attack a plant, the rate of defoliation is extremely variable from one leaf to another, independently of the leaf's age, so that a qualitative analysis (attacked or not), is informative enough to illustrate the defensive role of the associated plant-ants.  We noted that A. octoarticulatus & Azteca sp.1 workers protect their host plant by attacking the Attine scouts, preventing them from recruiting nestmates to defoliate their host plants.  These results confirm those of numerous previous studies reporting that myrmecophytes are protected by their plant-ants.

In the first part of the study 21 species of ants were identified tending G. xiphias.  A variation in the associated ant fauna was observed during the day & also during the year.  Camponotus rufipes, C. crassus, C. renggeri, & Ectatomma edentatum were the most common ants observed tending G. xiphias.  Ants such as C. rufipes & E. edentatum were observed tending G. xiphias during the day, while other species like C. crassus & C. renggeri were observed tending membracids at different periods (the first during the day, the second during the night) on the same plant.  These associations were observed throughout the whole year, mainly in the summer.  An experimental manipulation in the field (ants excluded from a group of plants with G. xiphias & present in another group) showed that ants protect these membracids against their natural enemies: mainly Salticidae (spiders), Syrphidae (flies, larvae) & Hymenoptera (parasitoids).  Ant protection to the homopterans (nymphs & adults) was very effective. Plants with ants had significantly more new ovipositions than plants with ants excluded.  It was also observed that the benefit of this association can vary as a function of the ant attendants.  An experiment introducing alternative sugar sources on D. vinossum shrubs bearing G. xiphias & ants, showed that this new food source (=simulated extrafloral nectaries) was not capable of distracting ant attention from the homopterans.  On plants with alternative sugar sources, the membracids increased 5 times their exudate production, possibly to maintain ant attention.  Finally, it was shown that droplets of honeydew that falI on the ground & leaves below G. xiphias groups, can act as cues to would-be tending ants, who end up finding the membracids on the host plant.]",

We monitored the effect of ant exclusion for 3 years on leaf area loss to leaf chewing insects, thrips abundance, and reproductive output of the extrafloral nectary-bearing shrub, Peixotoa tomentosa (Malpighiaceae). We predicted that the impact of ants on herbivores and plants would depend on the ant species, and that fire would reduce the effect of ants. We deliberately chose control plants that differed in their occupant ant species. Fire occurred in the second year of the study, allowing us to determine its effect on the benefit afforded by ants. Ants reduced leaf area loss and thrips abundance, and increased fruit and seed production in all 3 years. Some ant species were more effective than others, while plants with multiple ant species suffered higher leaf area loss than plants with a single ant species. In the year following the fire, leaf damage was greater than in the other years, regardless of the ant species, and the proportional effect of ants in reducing damage was less. Interactions affecting thrips abundance did not change following fire, nor was the benefit to the plant proportionally reduced. Overall, the identity of the ant species had a greater effect than did the occurrence of fire on the ant-herbivore-plant interaction: the identity of the ant species influenced leaf area loss, thrips numbers, and bud and seed production, while fire only modified the impact of ants on the amount of leaf area consumed by insect herbivores.",

The most common trading coin that plants offer to pay for animal services is nectar; the main servers are hymenopterans. Extrafloral nectar (EFN) is produced in almost all aboveground plant parts not directly related with pollination, and their true function has long been an issue of discussion among naturalists and will be our main subject. The protective function of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) is reviewed and considered with an alternative hypothesis, presenting not only ants, but also spiders and wasps as potential and effective agents in these protective interactions. Despite their likely relevance, the phenological variation (mainly sequential flowering and resprouting) of host plants mediating these interactions have been generally ignored. We discuss how the outcomes of each ant-EFN bearing plant interaction vary depending on physical and biotic changes in interacting organisms (internal factors such as phenology and species identity) as well as in their environments (external factors such as climatic variation), all of which may modify the character of each interaction. We propose that ant-EFN bearing plant interactions serve an excellent and unique model to test the \"Geographic Mosaic Theory\" of coevolution providing us a more clear view of how evolution has structured these plant-animal ecological networks.",

    "abstract": "The causal mechanisms shaping and structuring ecological communities are among the most important themes in ecology. The study of insect-plant interactions in trophic nets is pointed out as basic to improve our knowledge on this issue. The cerrado tropical savanna, although extremely diverse, distributed in more than 20% of the Brazilian territory and filled up with rich examples of multitrophic interactions, is underexplored in terms of biodiversity interaction. Here, this ecosystem is suggested as valuable to the study of insect-plant interactions whose understanding can throw a new light at the ecological communities' theory. Three distinct systems: extrafloral nectary plants or trophobiont herbivores and the associated ant fauna; floral herbivores-predators-pollinators; and plants-forest engineers and associated fauna, will serve as examples to illustrate promising new pathways in cerrado. The aim of this brief text is to instigate young researchers, mainly entomologists, to initiate more elaborated field work, including experimental manipulations in multitrophic systems, to explore in an interactive way the structure that maintain preserved viable communities in the Neotropical savanna.",

The present study aims to describe the distribution, anatomy, and ecological aspects of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) of three Calolisianthus species and in particular the ultrastructure of EFNs in Calolisianthus speciosus during leaf development, discussing its unusual structure. Leaves of Calolisianthus species were fixed and processed by the usual methods for studies using light, scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ion chromatography was used to analyze the nectar exudates of C. speciosus. The distribution patterns of nectar secretion units were analysed by ANOVA and t-tests. Two EFNs that can be seen macroscopically were observed at the bases of C. speciosus and C. pendulus leaves. Such large nectaries are absent there in C. amplissimus. Another similarly large EFN is observed at the apex of each leaf in all species. The EFNs at the base of the young leaves in C. speciosus are visited by ants during the rainy season. EFNs are formed by several nectar secretory units (nectarioles) that are present throughout the leaves. Each nectariole is formed by rosette cells with a central channel from which the nectar is released. Channels of old C. speciosus and C. pendulus EFNs were obstructed by fungi. TEM of EFNs in young leaves showed cytoplasms with secretion, small vacuoles, mitochondria, cell wall ingrowth, and plasmodesmata. TEM of EFNs in old leaves demonstrated dictyosomes, plastids, mitochondria, segments of endoplasmatic reticulum, and lipid droplets. The nectar contains sucrose, glucose and fructose. ants",

A considerable decrease (approx. 87%) in population density was observed. Significant variations both in the amount of pollen (18.5%-34.8% of pollen in the total anther dry weight, i.e. 0.5-1.5 mg per 10 anthers) and in pollen viability (38.8-97.0%) were noted. Both a low amount of pollen and low pollen viability may reduce the reproductive success of individuals. The most frequent visiting insects were bees (Apoidea), including solitary bees 45.7%, honeybees 20.4%, and bumblebees 11.4%. Dipterans, coleopterans (weevils), lepidopterans and ants were also recorded, implying a strong impact of C. bononiensis on insect biodiversity within grasslands.",

    "abstract": "Seed dispersal is a fundamental process in the lifecycle of all flowering plants. Many plant species have evolved specialist associations with biotic vectors to facilitate dispersal. Such specialised interactions mean that these associations are potentially highly sensitive to disruption, e.g. from invasive species. However, despite this threat we still understand remarkably little about how such perturbations affect the dynamics and efficiency of the seed-dispersal process. In this study we quantify the impacts of an invasive ant across three key phases of the seed dispersal process: seed removal, distribution and placement, in order to determine the stages of seed dispersal most vulnerable to disruption by invaders. Using the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) as a model, we show that invaded sites exhibited a significant decrease in seed dispersal services across all three phases of the dispersal process, relative to non-invaded sites. Seeds dispersed in invaded sites were: (a) less likely to be transported; (b) potentially distributed over a smaller spatial area, and (c) less likely to be placed at soil depths favourable for germination and establishment compared to those dispersed in non-invaded sites. These results reveal that ant-mediated seed dispersal services are significantly reduced by an invasive species at multiple stages in the dispersal process. Reductions in the efficacy of seed dispersal, combined with shifts in the ecological and geographical patterns of dispersal, may lead to cascading impacts on plant species composition and community structure. This study shows how an invasive ant can affect seed dispersal at several stages in the dispersal process.",

First, I took a broad perspective by looking at evolutionary events of myrmecochory across the ant phylogeny: these analyses revealed that myrmecochory is a diffuse interaction between many ant-plant guilds.  Second, in-depth analyses of the effects of the non-native invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) on both ant & plant communities in South Africa &  Spain suggested that these invaders are ill-equipped to replace the native seed dispersers that they displace.  Field observations suggested that invaded ant communities dispersed fewer seeds than non-invaded ant communities, & that this inefficiency is evident at multiple stages in the seed dispersal process.  Third, the modifications to the natural ant-plant interactions due to invasive ants may be making these environments more vulnerable to secondary invasions by other invasive myrmecochorous plant species.  Finally, I explore the mechanism that may be driving these changes in ant-seed interactions, by exploring how differences in a range of physical & chemical seed traits may explain ant preferences to disperse certain seeds.]",

We assessed the effects of browsing by deer and seed predation by rodents, ants and birds on the densities of seeds entering the seed bank of Ceanothus cuneatus var. rigidus, a maritime chaparral shrub in coastal California. Ceanothus produced many more seeds when protected from browsers in long-term experimental exclosures than did browsed plants, but the seed densities in the soil beneath browsed and unbrowsed Ceanothus were the same at the start of an intensive one-year study. The density of seeds in the soil initially increased in both treatments following summer seed drop: while densities returned to pre-drop levels within a few weeks under browsed plants, soil seed densities remained high for 5-8 months beneath unbrowsed plants. Rodent abundance (especially deer mice) was higher near unbrowsed plants than >30 m away, and rodents removed Ceanothus seeds from dishes in the experimental plots. At least in the short term, rodent density and rates of seed removal were inversely related to the intensity of browsing. Our data have management implications for maintaining viable Ceanothus populations by regulating the intensity of browsing and the timing, intensity and frequency of fires.",

Stems recently emerged from the underground tuber were self-supporting, contacting no other plants & encountering few foraging ants.  Stems then became lianescent, & contact with supporting plants greatly increased ant recruitment.  Both species & number of ant workers influenced the effect of ants on the major herbivore, the chrysomelid beetle Lilioceris latipennis.  Protective actions included limitation of oviposition (reduction in the number of eggs laid on the plant) & predation, leading to increased larval mortality.  The probability of successful predation was strongly dependent on larval size.  If temporarily low ant-patrolling activity allows larvae to grow beyond a critical size, their mechanical (thick integument) or chemical (plant-derived compounds in a fecal shield) defences become more effective against ants.  Secondary metabolites derived from the host plant thus appear to be important for the anti-predator mechanisms of this beetle, being necessary for its survival & reproduction on a host plant that actively recruits ants as a biotic defence against herbivores.]",

The most frequently inhibited pathogens in the cross-streaking tests were S. aureus & E. coli, while S. enterica was the least inhibited.  Among the 3 primary screening media used, ISP2 agar was the most suitable for secondary metabolism as more isolates exhibited antibacterial activity when grown on the medium.  TFS2010 & TFS2003, which matched to Streptomyces gramineus (>99% similarity), were the most bioactive isolates in cross-streaking tests.  TFS2010 displayed the strong antibacterial on Nutrient agar, Mueller Hinton agar, & ISP2 agar, while TFS2003 only exhibited strong antibacterial activity on Nutrient agar.  Furthermore, a difference in potency of extracts based on batch culture medium was noted in TFS2010.  DNA was extracted from 19 isolates & followed by 16SrRNA gene sequencing.

We assessed the replicability of the number of interactions found among species and also whether there had been changes in the network structure associated with appearance of new ant and plant species during that 10\u0010year period. Our results show that the nested topology of the network was similar between sampling dates, group dissimilarity increased, mean number of interactions for ant species increased, the frequency distribution of standardized degrees reached higher values for plant species, more ant species and fewer plant species constituted the core of the more recent network, and the presence of new ant and plant species increased while their contribution to nestedness remained the same. Generalist species (i.e., those with the most links or interactions) appeared to maintain the stability of the network because the new species incorporated into the communities were linked to this core of generalists. Camponotus planatus was the most extreme generalist ant species (the one with the most links) in both networks, followed by four other ant species; but other species changed either their position along the continuum of generalists relative to specialists or their presence or absence within the network. Even though new species moved into the area during the decade between the surveys, the overall network structure remained unmodified.          *[In Ecological Archives E091-058-A1: #60, #52, Forelius analis labelled Myrmicinae, it is a Dolichoderinae: # 62, Paratrechina longicornis labelled Myrmicinae, it is a Formicinae.]",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims Functional groups of species interact and coevolve in space and time, forming complex networks of interacting species. A long-term study of temporal variation of an ant-plant network is presented with the aims of: (1) depicting its structural changes over a 20-year period; (2) detailing temporal variation in network topology, as revealed by nestedness and modularity analysis and other parameters (i.e. connectance, niche overlap); and (3) identifying long-term turnover in taxonomic structure (i.e. switches in ant resource use or plant visitor assemblages according to taxa).  Methods Fieldwork was carried out at La Mancha, Mexico, and ant-plant interactions were observed between 1989 and 1991, between 1998 and 2000, and between May 2010 and 2011. Occurrences of ants on extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) were recorded. The resulting ant-plant networks were constructed from qualitative presence-absence data determined by a species-species matrix defined by the frequency of occurrence of each pairwise ant-plant interaction. Key Results Network variation across time was stable and a persistent nested structure may have contributed to the maintenance of resilient and species-rich communities. Modularity was lower than expected, especially in the most recent networks, indicating that the community exhibited high overlap among interacting species (e.g. few species were hubs in the more recent network, being partly responsible for the nested pattern). Structurally, the connections created among modules by super-generalists gave cohesion to subsets of species that otherwise would remain unconnected. This may have allowed an increasing cascade-effect of evolutionary events among modules. Mutualistic ant-plant interactions were structured 20 years ago mainly by the subdominant nectarivorous ant species Camponotus planatus and Crematogaster brevispinosa, which monopolized the best extrafloral nectar resources and out-competed other species with broader feeding habits. Through time, these ants, which are still present, lost their position as network hubs and diminished in their importance in structuring the network; simultaneously, plants gained in importance. Conclusions The long-term network analysis reveals a decrease in attended plant species richness, a notable increase in plant species participation from 1990 to 2010 (sustained by less plant taxonomic similarity in the older 1990 network), an increase in the number of ant species and a diminishing dominance of super-generalist ants. The structure of the community has remained highly nested and connected with low modularity, suggesting overall a more participative, homogeneous, cohesive interaction network. Although previous studies have suggested that interactions between ants and EFN-bearing plants are susceptible to seasonality, abiotic factors and perturbation, this cohesive structure appears to be the key for biodiversity and community maintenance.",

In mature individuals, the only inhabitant is Tetraponera tessmanni, which is completely restricted to Vitex lianas as its sole host.  Established colonies of this ant provide effective defense against herbivores.  The association between V. thyrsiflora and T. tessmanni is unusual in 2 respects.  First, the climbing life form is rare among myrmecophytes.  Secondly, it is surprising that a pseudomyrmecine should be the obligate associate of a liana.  T. tessmanni does not prune & is associated with a plant whose success depends on contacts with many other plants.  Several traits of V. thyrsiflora and T. tessmanni combine to make the colonization of host plants by potential competitors very difficult.  These include behavioral and morphological filters restricting entrance into the plant and exploitation of the resources it can supply.  Plant anatomical organization enables T. tessmanni workers to carry out all activities, except leaf patrolling, within a single, branched private nesting space within which all food resources offered by the plant are produced.  T. tessmanni is polygynous, permitting the colony to monopolize a large, rapidly growing & long-lived territory.]",

Although there are records of ants with the ability to remove the pollinarium on this subfamily, the role of these insects as pollinators is not yet known. Therefore, we investigated the interaction between flowers and ants, as well as the associated features in two species of Asclepiadoideae, Ditassa capillaris and D. hastata. The studied species were both visited by Cephalotes inaequalis and Dorymyrmex thoracicus. We analyzed the common traits of ant pollination of the plant species, recorded the number of visit by ants, and carried out experiments of selective pollination, developing an effectivity index. Both Ditassa species have common traits of ant pollination, such as small bright flowers with exposed floral resource. The pollinarium is clip-shaped and resistant to the metapleural gland, which ensures effective pollination. Dorymyrmex thoracicus is a very frequent but not very efficient pollinator, whereas Cephalotes inaequalis is more efficient though at a lower frequency. Therefore, the total contributions of both ants to the pollination of both Ditassa species are similar. The features of both Ditassa species which favor ant pollination, include some synapomorphies within Asclepiadoideae. Furthermore, the efficiency of the ants as pollinators to the reproductive success of the plants was similar despite the different behaviors observed in both ant species. Hence, we suggest that the role of ants in pollination within this subfamily has been neglected.",

However, such modularity is infrequent in seed dispersal networks, presumably because research on those networks predominantly includes a single taxonomic animal group (e.g. birds). Herein, for the first time, we examine the pattern of interaction in a network that includes multiple taxonomic groups of seed dispersers, and the mechanisms underlying modularity. We found that the network was nested and modular, with five distinguishable modules. Our examination of the mechanisms underlying such modularity showed that plant and animal trait values were associated with specific modules but phylogenetic effect was limited. Thus, the pattern of interaction in this network is only partially explained by shared evolutionary history. We conclude that the observed modularity emerged by a combination of phylogenetic history and trait convergence of phylogenetically unrelated species, shaped by interactions with particular types of dispersal agents.",

    "abstract": "*[The present study investigates the protective role of ants against phytophagous insects of Urera baccifera in a semi-deciduous forest in south-east Brazil.  Many ant species intensively visit shrubs of U. baccifera throughout the year, except during leaf fall.  Ants forage on all vegetative & reproductive plant structures, but most especially on leaves where they harvest pearl bodies.   Besides pearl bodies ants also use the fleshy fruits of U. baccifera as food resource.   Pearl bodies are effective ant attractants, & U. baccifera individuals were significantly more visited by ants than neighboring plants without rewards.  Ant visitation to non-reproductive individuals of U. baccifera increased larval mortality of Smyma blomfildia, suggesting that ants attracted to pearl bodies reduce herbivore survival.  Fruits play a role in ant attraction increasing ant recruitment to U. baccifera.  Results of an ant-exclusion experiment show that ants were effective in reducing the incidence of lepidopteran larvae.  In both 2003 & 2004, herbivores presented higher infestation levels on ant-excluded shrubs than on control shrubs (ants present) of U. baccifera.  There is a temporal variation in the outcomes of the ant-U. baccifera interaction.  In 2003 ant-excluded plants have significantly faster leaf abscission rates compared with ant-visited plants.  However, ant exclusion had no effect on leaf abscission in 2004.  Results show that the outcomes of the interaction may be conditioned by herbivore abundance.  At high levels of herbivore infestation, such as in 2004, ant visitation may not be sufficient to decrease herbivore induced leaf abscission.]",

Plants with active extrafloral nectaries had increased seed removal, demonstrating a novel role of extrafloral nectar & an example of ecological pleiotropy.  To explore how focal species avoid negative interactions between partners, I measured ant preference for extrafloral nectar versus floral nectar using baits & a Capillary Feeder (CAFE) assay.  Ants consumed similar volumes, but recruited more to extrafloral nectar, suggesting that the rewards are tailored to the specific mutualist.

We found support for 3 predictions that follow from the antibiotic hypothesis. First, for all 10 ant & 11 plant species in our study, contact with ants significantly reduced pollen germination, confirming the generality of this effect. Second, contact with 2 bee species did not have similar effects; pollen exposed to bees germinated as well as control pollen. Third, consistent with the presumed greater abundance of entomopathogens in the tropics, which may have selected for stronger antibiotic secretions in tropical ants, tropical ants had more negative effects on pollen than temperate ants.  We speculate that the antibiotic hypothesis contributes not only to the rarity, but also to the biogeography of ant pollination, & we discuss whether the negative effects of ants on pollen have resulted in selection for floral defenses against ants.]",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant mutualisms may provide indirect evidence for costs of antiherbivore defenses when plants demonstrate trade-offs between allocating resources and energy into ant attractants versus chemical defenses. We tested the hypothesis that ecological trade-offs in defenses are present in Piper cenocladum. This plant possesses two distinct defenses: food bodies that attract predatory ants that destroy herbivore eggs and amides that deter herbivores. Previous studies have demonstrated that the food bodies in P. cenocladum are an effective defense because the ants deter herbivory by specialist herbivores. Amides in other Piper species have been shown to have toxic qualities, but we tested the additional hypothesis that these amides have an actual defensive function in P. cenocladum. To test for ecological trade-offs between the two putative defenses, fragments of P. cenocladum were examined for the presence of amides both when the plant was producing food bodies and when it was not producing food bodies.  Plants with active ant colonies had redundant defenses, producing food bodies and high levels of amides at the same time, but we detected a trade-off in that they had significantly lower levels of amides than did plants with no ants. To test for the defensive value of P. cenocladum amides, we used an ant bioassay and we examined herbivory results from previous experiments with plants that had variable levels of amides. These tests demonstrated that amides are deterrent to omnivorous ants, leaf cutting ants, and orthopterans. In contrast, the resident Pheidole bicornis ants are effective at deterring herbivory by specialist herbivores that oviposit eggs on the plant but not at deterring herbivory by nonresident omnivores. We concluded that although both amides and food body production appear to be costly, redundancy in defenses is necessary to avoid damage by a complex suit of herbivores.",

At the conclusion of the experiments, plants were harvested and size of leaves, secondary metabolite content (amides), epiphyll cover, and the species richness of the lichens (which comprised 85% of the epiphyll community) were quantified. Epiphyll cover (mosses, liverworts, and lichens) was greater on plants that had ant-mutualists and balanced resources. Lichen species richness was greater for plants with balanced resources, particularly for those with high light availability. Relationships between toxins and lichen cover and richness were weak and unclear.

    "abstract": "A key challenge in the study of mutualism is to understand the mechanisms that prevent cheating. In some systems, host retaliation against cheaters prevents the breakdown of cooperation. Here, we focus on the converse of this demonstration, and ask whether hosts that fail to retaliate are commonly inhabited by cheaters. We do so using the classic ant-plant interaction, in which plants provide ant-housing (domatia) in return for protection from herbivores. Our model system is the rattan ant-palm Korthalsia furtadoana, which grows swollen leaf sheaths as domatia and associates with two species of obligate host-ants, Camponotus sp90 and C. sp93, and with facultative Crematogaster and 'tramp' ant species. One ant-tree species is known to retaliate by tying the growth of domatia to the successful protection of new leaves, and non-protecting cheaters are rare. In contrast, K. furtadoana grows the domatium before the new leaf develops, suggesting that sanctioning may not be possible. We experimentally simulated herbivory by cutting leaves from shoots and found no difference in the mortality and growth of domatia on such 'cheated' shoots than on controls, confirming that K. furtadoana cannot sanction non-protectors. We then investigated the intensity of protection that Camponotus and Crematogaster ant-symbionts provide K. furtadoana. We demonstrate that C. sp90, which only inhabit half of colonized plants, vigorously protects leaves, that C. sp93 rarely protects, and that Crematogaster never protects. We then show that plants inhabited by C. sp90 have a higher growth rate than those inhabited by C. sp93.

In the present study, we used an in silico analysis of terminal restriction fragments (tRF) to characterize the bacterial community of the plant ant Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus. This species is an obligate inhabitant of Acacia myrmecophytes and feeds exclusively on plant-derived food sources. Ants are the dominant insect group in tropical rain forests. Associations of ants with microbes, which contribute particularly to the ants' nitrogen nutrition, could allow these insects to live on mostly or entirely plant-based diets and could thus contribute to the explanation of the high abundances that are reached by tropical ants. We found tRF patterns representing at least 30 prokaryotic taxa, of which the Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetes comprised 93%. Because most bacterial taxa were found in all ant-derived samples studied and because the bacteria detected on the ants' host plant revealed little overlap with this community, we regard our results as reliably representing the bacterial community that is associated with P. ferrugineus. Genera with a likely function as ant symbionts were Burkholderia, Pantoea, Weissella, and several members of the Enterobacteriaceae: The presence of these and various other groups was confirmed via independent PCR and cultivation approaches. Many of the bacteria that we detected belong to purportedly N-fixing taxa. Bacteria may represent important further partners in ant-plant mutualisms, and their influences on ant nutrition can contribute to the extraordinary abundance and evolutionary success of tropical arboreal ants.",

    "abstract": "We synthesized the current information on mesophytic cove forests in the southern Appalachians, assessed the range of variation in herb species composition and diversity in stands with different disturbance histories and environmental conditions, identified key knowledge gaps, and suggested approaches to fill these knowledge gaps. The purpose of this synthesis was to provide information to forest managers to help make decisions about conservation assessments and strategies for rich cove forests in the southern Appalachians. An important finding is that no single study or data set can provide conclusive evidence or clear management strategies. However, an overriding conclusion is that the magnitude of impact and the management actions necessary to restore herbaceous communities are directly proportional to the severity of disturbance, current condition (e.g., presence of Rhododendron), site heterogeneity, and historical land use (e.g., agricultural activity). These factors plus a host of other stressors (e.g., climate variability, air pollution, invasives) are likely to have a strong influence on the highly variable patterns observed when comparing herbaceous diversity of 'old-growth' or uncut forests to human disturbed forests (e.g., cutting, air pollution, conversion, invasive plants or insects). Results from this review reinforce our premise that factors controlling herbaceous species presence and abundance are highly complex, thus broad generalizations about the impacts of a single factor such as logging should be interpreted with caution. Of the stressors known to affect forest trees (e.g., pests and pathogens, acidic deposition, air pollution, drought, and wind), little to no information exists on how these same stressors will affect herbaceous plants. A limited number of studies have examined the demography or physiology of forest herbs, particularly across all life stages. While the demography of a few genera have been studied (e.g., Hexastylis, Asarum, Trillium, Arisaema, Goodyera, Hepatica), little to no information exists for the majority of woodland herbs. Species identity is important when considering management of rich cove forests. Diversity may increase following canopy disturbances that favor recruitment of early-seral herbaceous species; therefore, simple indices of diversity (H2, S, and E) are not the best measure of recovery in mesophytic rich coves, particularly where shade-adapted 'rich-cove indicator' species have been replaced by these species. Species-specific life histories and the influence of prevailing site conditions are important lines of research for understanding recovery and sustainability of mesophytic rich cove forests.

Furthermore, many myrmecophytic plants in disturbed sites lost their mutualistic ant partners or were colonized by opportunistic, nonspecialized ants.  Robustness of ant-myrmecophyte networks on islands was lower than robustness near lake edges & in undisturbed forest & was particularly susceptible to the extinction of plants.

In this study, we evaluated the importance of mucilage secretion in seeds as a mechanism to reduce seed collection by ants. We selected three Mediterranean species with strong mucilage secretion on their seeds which become sticky upon wetting. Seeds of Rosmarinus officinalis, Fumana ericoides, and Fumana thymifolia were exposed to ants and survival was compared between dry loose seeds and seeds glued to the soil with previously secreted mucilage. The study site was in the Sierra Calderona, 25 km north of Valencia (Spain). The ant-plant interaction was analyzed by scrutinizing seed collection by ants and by analyzing the waste piles of ant nests. To test survival, groups of 10 seeds were placed on the ground. Each group consisted of five control (dry) and five mucilaginous seeds (previously mucilage secreted) and was covered by the cover of a Petri dish modified to permit only the entry of ants. Seeds were inspected weekly for seed disappearance and the survival function (Kaplan-Meier estimator) was calculated. Seeds of the target species were important food items for ants and were actively collected, and more than 50 % of the experimental seeds that were glued to the ground with their own mucilage survived at the end of the study period but only 0-20 % of the control seeds survived after the same time of exposure. The implications for plant establishment of these findings are discussed.          *[Six different ant species are present in the study site: Messor bouvieri, M. capitatus, Aphaenogaster iberica, Formica subrufa, Tapinoma nigerrimum, & Camponotus sylvaticus.

The study was conducted in a closed area of 628 ha of Cerrado, located in Uberlandia, Brazil & the data were collected from January to December 2007 (bimonthly) & 2008 (monthly).  We established randomly in the area of cerrado of the reserve, 15 quarters of 10m x 10m where all trees with diameter at breast height greater than or equal to 3 centimeters were marked with numbered label & sampled.  We sampled a total of 1006 individuals belonging to 82 species & 34 families.  The species Ouratea spectabilis (137 individuals) was the most abundant in the study area, followed by Banisteriopsis malifolia (122), Machaerium acutifolium (59), & Tabebuia ochracea (41).  The loss of leaf area varied significantly over time & between families & species of plants.  The driest months of the year showed the greatest loss of leaf area in both 2007 (April, June, & August) & in 2008 (May-August).  Climatic factors also significantly influenced the loss of leaf area, as it varied over time, depending on the rainfall & temperature variation.  The results of this study indicated that the loss of leaf area community of cerrado plants varies seasonally & occurs mostly in the dry season.  Abiotic factors like temperature & rainfall influence the phenology of species of plants, seeking the best time to maximize their development & prevent natural enemies result in significant losses for their survival & reproductive success.  The characteristics of each species promote differences in leaf area loss due to defenses and/or mutualistic associations they have.

    "abstract": "Edge effects are among the most important drivers of species interactions in fragmented habitats, but the impacts of edge effects on multitrophic interactions are largely unknown. In this study we assess edge effects on species interactions within an ant-plant mutualistic system -- where ants protect plants against herbivory -- to determine whether habitat edges alter the amount of protection ants provide. We focus on a single species of myrmecophytic plant, Solanum americanum, and experimentally manipulate ant access to study plants in large-scale fragmented habitat patches at the Savannah River Site National Environmental Research Park, USA. In this system, S. americanum commonly hosts honeydew-producing aphids that are tended by ants, and grasshoppers are the primary herbivores. We measured edge effects on the per-plant abundance of aphids and protective ants as well as the abundance of grasshoppers in each habitat patch, and we evaluated levels of ant protection against herbivory near and far from habitat edges. We found that ants provided significant protection to plants far from edges, where herbivory pressure was highest, despite the fact that aphids and ants were least abundant on these plants. Conversely, ants did not provide significant protection near edges, where herbivory pressure was lowest and aphids and ants were most abundant. We conclude that a strong edge effect on grasshopper abundance was a key factor determining the amount of protection ants provided against herbivory. Future studies of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on ant-plant mutualisms will benefit from studies of ant behavior in response to herbivory threats, and studies of edge effects on other species interactions may also need to consider how species' behavioral patterns influence the interactions in question.",

    "abstract": "Extrafloral nectar of plants and honeydew of hemipterans is a food source extensively explored by ants. Although basically a sugary liquid food, nectar and honeydew are composed of different nutrients and offered in distinct ways; thus, ants must interact differently with plants and hemipterans. In this study we assessed the availability and dominance of nectar of extrafloral nectaries and honeydew of sap-sucking hemipterans (i.e., sugar-based resources) as mechanisms regulating interaction frequency and structuring ant-plant-hemipteran networks. We studied 12 plant species (240 shrubs, 20 per species) and 12 hemipteran species (240 aggregations, 20 per species) that interacted with 26 ant species in an area of Rupestrian Fields (Rocky Montane Savannah), Brazil. We observed that the 7 ant species that collected honeydew were a subset of the 25 ant species feeding on nectar, but the highly interacted species Camponotus crassus was the same for both subnetworks. The ant-plant subnetwork exhibited a nested pattern of interaction with a low degree of specialization, while the ant-hemipteran subnetwork exhibited lower nestedness but higher specialization. We found a positive relationship between the offer of EFNs and the number of interactions with ants, probably resulting from reduced competition in plants with high availability of EFNs. However, hemipteran species that were most abundant did not interact with more species of ants, probably because of the numerical dominance of the species tending all hemipteran aggregations, regardless of size. However, segregation between ant species was higher than expected by chance for both plants and hemipterans, confirming a deterministic factor (i.e., competition between ant species) regulating the frequency of interactions. In summary, the availability of ENFs seems to be an important mechanism regulating ant-plant interactions, while numerical dominance seems to be an important mechanism structuring ant-hemipteran interactions.",

All ant species were tested with a task of finding & removing a standardized herbivore surrogate (termites) to quantify the relative effective protection of different ant species.  We correlated ant protection to the volume & concentration of sugar in the nectar as conditional factors & the herbivore damage as interaction outcome.  We found that 11 of the 23 species of ants attacked & removed 933 of 2000 termites.  The most interactive ant species were Camponotus crassus (visited 127 shrubs of 10 plant species), Ca. novogranadensis (94; 10), Pseudomyrmex gracilis (55; 9), & Cephalotes pusillus (42; 8).  The species Ca. crassus recruited the largest number of ant workers (1067 ants in total; 47% of the observed ants), followed by Ca. novogranadensis (403; 18%), P. gracilis (230; 11%), & Ce. pusillus (227; 11%).  Eight other ant species recruited less than 130 workers each to collect nectar (less than 5%) & another 11 ant species recruited less than 10 workers each (less than 0.5%).  All plant species interacted with effective ant protectors, although the identity of the best protector varied among plants.  The degree of ant protection was positively associated with sugar concentration of nectar, which further explained the variation in leaf damage among plant species.  Our study provides evidence that ant protection varies among ant species & is enhanced by the plant investment in nectar reward, resulting in less herbivory for the partner plant.]",

    "abstract": "Fire is one of the main natural disturbances in Tropical Savannas, changing the diversity of species, altering the structure of species interactions, and driving the evolution of adaptations. Here, we investigated the effects of fire disturbance on interactions between ants and plants with extrafloral nectaries in Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna). We carried out the study in two different ecosystems of Brazilian Cerrado 700/km apart; Woody Cerrado and Rupestrian Grasslands. We conducted a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) experiment, in which the impact was the disturbance caused by fire. In Woody Cerrado, we found no evidence of fire affecting the diversity and composition of plants or its interactions. Fire also did not affect ant diversity but changed the interaction pattern of its interactions by reorganizing the paired interactions between species (i.e., rewiring). However, this effect did not result in changes on the overall structure of the network. In Rupestrian Grasslands, fire also did not affect the diversity and composition of plant species or its interactions, but it did increase the number of ant species and change its composition, leading to a reorganization of the its paired interactions. However, these fire disturbances in the ant level did not affect the overall structure of the network. Our findings indicate that the structure of ant-plant interaction networks is robust to fire disturbances, more in Woody Cerrado than Rupestrian Grasslands, confirming our hypothesis that ant-plant interactions in Cerrado are adapted to fire disturbances. In sum, our study enhances the understanding of the effects of environmental disturbances and the stability of the ant-plant interactions in fire-adapted ecosystems such as Brazilian Cerrado.",

The present study describes some of the interactions between ants and this bamboo species. The experiment was carried out in a fragment of a montane tropical forest in the Parque Estadual do Itacolomi, near Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil. Thirty culms of bamboo were randomly collected. The ants were obtained by direct collection from nodes and internodes. Morphometric variables of the bamboo were recorded for characterization of potential ant habitat. Merostachys fischeriana grows in rosettes as a thin bamboo (average = 1,0 cm; se = 0,27; n = 20) and is tall enough to reach the upper canopy of this low forest (average = 9,1 m; se = 2,72; n = 20). Fifteen ant species were sampled. Brachymyrmex heeri Forel was the most abundant in the nodes, while Camponotus crassus Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) was the most abundant in the internodes. The composition of the species that inhabit the internodes was different from the composition in the node (Q-test: Q = 3,76; P = 0,05). The level of occupation was defined by the number of holes (F = 10,33; P < 0,01), the number of internodes in the canopy (F = 6,84; P = 0,01) and the length of the culm (F = 7,52; P = 0,01).

    "abstract": "In tropical forests, several reforestation programs have been created to recover biological diversity in deforested environments. However, most of these studies have focused on the loss of species and ignored the loss of ecological interactions and ecosystem services that these species provide in their natural environment. Here, we assess how reforestation (including both native and exotic species) and the distance from the forest matrix could recover the following parameters: richness, composition, and ant-plant interactions in the southern Brazilian Amazon. For this, we collected data in five different agroforestry landscapes: primary and secondary forests, reforestations of teak and fig, and pasture. In general, we observed that the distance from the forest matrix was not an important factor for the recovery of ant-plant interactions at the scale of this study. Ant-plant interactions were more specialized in the pasture, possibly due to the low richness and high dominance in pastures, which generates a high ant-plant dependency. Moreover, none of the strategies employed for the recovery of diversity (teak and fig reforestation) increased the recovery rate of the studied parameters: richness, composition, and the patterns of ant-plant interactions, when compared to primary forests. These results indicate that regardless of species richness and composition, secondary forests and reforestation lands are functionally different from pastures. In conclusion, our results represent a valuable tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show that secondary forests created by natural regeneration can be an efficient and economical method for restoring the disruption of ant-plant interactions in tropical forests.",

However, one of the biggest criticisms of these studies is how sampling effort can affect the observed interaction patterns within these plant-animal networks. In this study we empirically evaluated how variation in sampling effort (comparing cumulative vs monthly sampled networks) influences the values of network descriptors more frequently used in the literature (i.e. number of links per species, network size, diversity of interactions, network specialization, robustness, nestedness, and modularity). For this, we studied interaction networks between ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectar sampled over 12 months in a tropical environment on the coast of Mexico. In general, all network descriptors used in this study were influenced by sampling effort via its effects on the record of new ant-plant interactions throughout the year. Interestingly, network specialization and the modularity tended to decrease with the increase of sampling effort, while all the other network descriptors tended to increase along with the sampling effort. Our study highlights the importance of standardizing data sampling in comparative studies to make sure that the results found in studies dealing with ecological networks are reliable, since the intensity of the sampling effort can directly affect the structure of plant-animal interaction networks.",

However, despite the great advances in the knowledge of TIS, still little is known about the impacts of these ants on the trophic cascade. In this study we used an approach based on network theory to explore the impact of TIS on the structure and ecological dynamic of a well-sampled and well-known community of ant-plant interactions in a tropical environment in coastal Veracruz, Mexico. We observed that of all the ant-plant interactions recorded, only 15% involved TIS and the ant Paratrechina longicornis (Formicinae) was the unique tramp species to be part of the central core of highly interacting species. We also found that TIS had little impact on the structure and dynamic ant-plant interactions in our study area, although possible indirect effects for specific TIS are also discussed. This study represents a valuable tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show the vulnerability and robustness of a tropical system rich in species and interactions to biological invasions.          *[We recorded 33 plant species included in 20 families, 30 genera, with Fabaceae as the most well represented family (n = 8 species).  For ants, we recorded 48 ant species included in 5 subfamilies, 21 genera, with Myrmicinae as the most well represented subfamily (n =17 species).  Of the total ant species sampled, 43 were native species & 5 were tramp & invasive species: Monomorium floricola, Monomorium pharaonis, Paratrechina longicornis, Solenopsis geminata, & Wasmannia auropunctata (n = 11.6%).]          *[Brachymyrmex sp 1 listed twice in Figure 1.]",

    "abstract": "Non-native species often acquire novel interspecific interactions, which are central to several hypotheses of invasion success, including biotic resistance and invasional meltdown. However, the outcome of these interactions is not often linked with the demographic evidence based on the full life cycle of the species. The Philippine Ground Orchid (Spathoglottis plicata) has invaded Puerto Rico and has acquired both negative and positive interspecific interactions involving the native weevil Stethobaris polita and the invasive red fire ant Solenopsis invicta, respectively. We studied a population in the Rio Abajo Forest, and asked how these interactions affect population demography by using a combination of field, experimental and modelling approaches. Stage-structured matrix population models based on four years of field observations showed that the population of S. plicata is growing at a rate (\u00aa) of 1.05 under natural conditions. When we modified fecundity values based on experimental exclusion of weevils and ants, the control treatment showed a similar \u00aa. Excluding weevils increased \u00aa to 1.20, whereas the exclusion of ants decreased \u00aa to 1.03. When we incorporate demographic and environmental stochasticity in our models, exclusion of invasive red fire ants significantly reduces the orchid abundance over time. Although weevils offer some biotic resistance to S. plicata, these effects do not prevent orchid population growth and expansion. On the other hand, invasive red fire ants have a positive effect on the invasive orchid\u0019s \u00aa, partially supporting the invasional meltdown hypothesis. This study presents a method that allows one to combine opposing mechanisms of species interactions within the same quantitative framework, and the results highlight the importance of considering acquired plant-animal interactions and stochastic processes when evaluating the population growth rates and dynamics of invasive plants.",

Ferns represent the second largest group of vascular plants and are especially abundant in tropical forest understories, but seem to be avoided as food plants. We studied the leaf damage caused by leaf-cutter ants and its relation with water content, trichome density, alkaloids, triterpenoids, and total phenol and nitrogen content of nine fern species occurring in close vicinity to Atta cephalotes (L.) nests from rainforests in Brazil. Meniscium serratum Cav. presented the highest leaf damage with 32.3%, three other species had a leaf damage of less than 5%, and the remaining five species were undamaged. Food preferences of leaf-cutter ants were related with higher water content (>\t70%), but independent of any other measured variables. Additional observations from Mexico and Costa Rica provided evidence that a larger number of ferns are attacked by leaf-cutter ants. We suggest that highly damaged fern species might serve them as an occasional, short-term, alternative diet when growing close to ant nests, whereas less damaged fern species might have some chemical components harmful for the fungus and detected a posteriori, because they were rejected after initial harvesting by leaf-cutter ants.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic disturbance and the spread of non-native species disrupt natural communities, but also create novel interactions between species. By-product mutualisms, in which benefits accrue as side effects of partner behaviour or morphology, are often non-specific and hence may persist in novel ecosystems. We tested this hypothesis for a two-way by-product mutualism between epiphytic ferns and their ant inhabitants in the Bornean rain forest, in which ants gain housing in root-masses while ferns gain protection from herbivores. Specifically, we assessed how the specificity (overlap between fern and ground-dwelling ants) and the benefits of this interaction are altered by selective logging and conversion to an oil palm plantation habitat. We found that despite the high turnover of ant species, ant protection against herbivores persisted in modified habitats. However, in ferns growing in the oil palm plantation, ant occupancy, abundance and species richness declined, potentially due to the harsher microclimate. The specificity of the fern-ant interactions was also lower in the oil palm plantation habitat than in the forest habitats. We found no correlations between colony size and fern size in modified habitats, and hence no evidence for partner fidelity feedbacks, in which ants are incentivised to protect fern hosts. Per species, non-native ant species in the oil palm plantation habitat (18 % of occurrences) were as important as native ones in terms of fern protection and contributed to an increase in ant abundance and species richness with fern size. We conclude that this by-product mutualism persists in logged forest and oil palm plantation habitats, with no detectable shift in partner benefits. Such persistence of generalist interactions in novel ecosystems may be important for driving ecosystem functioning.",

We have discovered a completely different myrmecophytic system in which an ant species of the Formicinae lives in symbiosis with the peat swamp forest tree Macaranga puncticulata (Gage 1922).  M. puncticulata twigs develop spacious cavities (domatia).  An undescribed Camponotus (Colobopsis) (Mayr 1861) species of the C. saundersi-group was the dominant ant inhabitant (65% of the investigated plants) at forest sites, but this species, provisionally named C. (Colobopsis) sp.1, was only rarely found at open stands.  Another 29 opportunistic stem-nesting ant species were collected less frequently.  None of them were Crematogaster (Decacrema) ants.  C. (Colobopsis) sp.1 has never been found to nest away from M. puncticulata.  The mated queens are capable of locating young M. puncticulata plants & of chewing entrance holes into the domatia.  In contrast to all the other obligate plant-ants associated with Macaranga, C. (Colobopsis) sp.1 never cultivates any trophobionts, neither inside nor outside the domatia.  Instead of taking up honey dew from coccids, the ants obtain carbohydrates from extrafloral nectaries along the leaf margins of M. puncticulata.  This food source is an uncommon trait within Macaranga myrmecophytes.  The association of C. (Colobopsis) sp.1 with M. puncticulata is therefore the first record of a 2-partner ant-plant system without endophytic coccids in the genus Macaranga.]",

    "abstract": "In Peninsular Malaysia two myrmecophytic Macaranga species (Euphorbiaceae) exclusively occur in peat swamp forests: M. pruinosa and M. puncticulata. M. pruinosa is associated with specific Crematogaster ants. Probably two similar Crematogaster species are involved, which can only be distinguished by morphometric characters of the queen ants. The ants feed on food bodies mainly provided on the stipules of the plants and in addition cultivate trophobiotic coccids in stem domatia. Thus, the association represents a 3-partner-system. In the syntopic species M. puncticulata we discovered a fully different myrmecophytic system. 65% of all M. puncticulata were inhabited by an yet undescribed Camponotus (Colobopsis) of the saundersi-species group. Colonization of M. puncticulata was (contrary to M. pruinosa) restricted to shady forest sites. The high percentage of colonization as well as the mode of colony foundation indicate an obligatory association between the two species. Colonies are founded by queen ants which search for young host plants and chew entrance holes into the hollow stem domatia. The plants also provide food bodies and in addition offer nectar from glands situated along the whole leaf margin. In contrast to the so far investigated Crematogaster ants in Macaranga, Colobopsis sp. does not cultivate any trophobionts. This association is therefore the first record of a two-partner Macaranga myrmecophytic system. It also differs from Macaranga-Crematogaster in other characters, e.g. large colonies may inhabit several neighbouring trees polydomously. The workers also collect insects as protein supplement, thus leaving their plants for foraging. Despite the differences, Colobopsis sp. fulfils the same protective role as already described for Macaranga-Crematogaster associations.",

    "abstract": "*[Many adult Macaranga ant-plants possess 'prostomata', (i.e. preformed, thin zones of the stem, where ants preferably chew their entrance holes).  Crematogaster workers recognize the position of the prostoma from inside the domatia by using incident daylight as an orientation cue.  Experimental darkening of the translucent prostoma forced the ants to change over to other positions.  As a rule, holes in prostoma position were chewed from inside. Many Macaranga ant-plants lack a prostoma.  The ant inhabitants of these species chew holes from outside the stem, exclusively on the twig undersides & at positions that are not related to phyllotaxy.  The stems of most prostoma-free Macaranga hosts are covered by slippery epicuticular wax crystals & their domatium walls are mostly thinner than in non-glaucous hosts.  These correlations suggest that the prostoma acts as an ecological filter favoring specialists over generalists.]",

    "abstract": "*[In many ant-plant species of the genus Macaranga in South-East Asia, conspicuous blooms of epicuticular wax crystals cover the stem surface.  We found that many ant species were unable to walk on these surfaces.  Only the specific ant partners of glaucous Macaranga host plants were capable of moving on the slippery stems without difficulty.  Therefore, the epicuticular coatings of Macaranga myrmecophytes appear to have a selective function & protect the associated ants against competitors.  The epicuticular aggregates function as a physical barrier; no evidence of chemical repellence was found.  The extent to which 'foreign' ant species are excluded from a tree strongly depends on inclination, diameter, & length of the glaucous stem sections.  The particular growth form of some glaucous Macaranga ant-plants enhances the influence of the wax barriers.  The ant associates of glaucous & glossy Macaranga ant-plants, Camponotus & Crematogaster, differ strongly in their capacity to adhere to the glaucous stems.  For this reason, the wax blooms in Macaranga can act as an ecological isolation mechanism for the sympiotic ants.  Within the genus Macaranga, we find a high correspondence between the occurrence of glaucousness & obligatory ant association (50% in ant-plants; 6.7% in non-myrmecophytes).]",

    "abstract": "Many ant partners of tropical ant-plants prune the leaves and shoot tips of other plants growing around their hosts. According to the hypothesis proposed by Davidson et al. (Ecology 69:801-808), this specialized behaviour not only protects the host plants against overgrowth, but it also conveys a direct benefit to the ant colony as it removes contact points to the neighbouring vegetation where invasions of enemy ants could occur. Here we test this hypothesis by comparing pruning intensity in five closely related Crematogaster (subgenus Decacrema) plant-ant species (and one species of Technomyrmex) that differ in their exposure to competition by other ants. Pruning intensity was quantified by measuring the area loss of paper tape pieces wrapped around the stems of Macaranga host plants. All Crematogaster (Decacrema) ants tested but not Technomyrmex sp. pruned, but the intensity of the behaviour varied strongly between and within species. Pruning was significantly weaker in the three tested Crematogaster species inhabiting Macaranga host plants with a slippery, waxy stem surface, which functions as a mechanical barrier protecting the specific ant partners against generalist competitors. Pruning was generally stronger on more densely ant-populated trees. Even though the number of ants per twig length was lower in associations of ants with glaucous Macaranga hosts, only part of the variation of pruning activity could be explained by \"ant density\". When corrected for ant density, \"wax-running\" Crematogaster (Decacrema) ants still pruned more weakly than their congeners inhabiting non-glaucous Macaranga hosts. Pruning is obviously most important when an ant-plant is potentially accessible to intruders, but less necessary when the ant colony is isolated by a protective wax barrier. Our results support the hypothesis that \"selfish\" defence against invasions is the major selective pressure that has led to the development and maintenance of pruning behaviour in weakly competitive plant-ants.",

In Macaranga myrmecophytes, the influence of ant competition strongly depends on the presence of slippery 'wax barriers'.  Of all Macaranga ant-plant species, 50% have waxy stems that can be climbed only by the specific ant partners & not by other ant species.  We compared the presentation of food (food bodies & extrafloral nectar) between waxy & non-waxy Macaranga host plants using traditional & phylogenetic comparative methods.  Consistent with the hypothesized effect of ant competition, wax-free Macaranga host species had fewer extrafloral nectaries & more often produced food bodies under recurved or tubular stipules inaccessible to other ants, Also, closed stipules were less persistent in waxy hosts.  Several traits showed phylogenetic signal, but our finding of a more promiscuous food presentation in waxy Macaranga hosts was still supported by phylogenetic comparative analyses.]",

The analyzed Crematogaster of the subgenus Decacrema fell into three distinct clades which are also characterized by specific morphological and ecological traits of queen morphology, host-plants, and colony structure.  The results supported the validity of the authors currently used morphospecies concept for Peninsula Malaysia.  However, on a wider geographic range, including North and North-East Borneo, some morphospecies turned out to be species complexes with genetically quite distinct taxa.  The phylogenetic analysis and host association studies do not indicate strict cocladogenesis between the subgenus Decacrema and their Macaranga host-plants, because multiple ant taxa occur on quite distinct host-plants belonging to different clades within the genus Macaranga.  These results support the view that host-shifting or host-expansion is common in the ants colonizing Macaranga.  Additionally, the considerable geographic substructuring found in the phylogenetic trees of the ants suggests that allopatric speciation has also played a role in the diversification and the current distribution of  Crematogaster (Decacrema).]",

We found differences in the onset of alate production, queen number, & mode of colony founding in the ant species, examining the consequences of these differences for the mutualism with the host plant.  The lifespan of some host plants & their specific ant partners seemed to be well matched, whille on others we found an ontogenetic succession of specific partner ants.  The partner ants of saplings or young plants often differed from specific partner ants found on larger trees of the same species.  Not all specific Crematogaster species can re-colonize the crown region of adult trees, thus facilitating a change of ant species.  Lifespan of the ant colony as well as colony founding behavior of the different partner ant species are important for these ontogenetic changes.  The lifespan of a colony of 2 species can be prolonged via secondary polygyny.  For the first time, also primary polygyny (=pleometrosis) is reported from this myrmecophytic system.]",

    "abstract": "*[In one of the most species-rich ant-plant symbiotic systems, worldwide pioneer trees of the euphorb genus Macaranga are inhabited by specific partner ants, mostly of the genus Crematogaster (Decacrema).  Both groups underwent radiation, with 30 species of Macaranga being colonized by 8 species of Crematogaster.  In this obligate association, the ants rely solely on their host for nutrition & nesting space.  Hosts are distributed patchily in disturbed sites or gaps in primary forest.  Association patterns are non-random in spite of the often sympatric occurrence of several host-plant species.  Generally, each ant species colonizes 2 to 7 different host species over its whole distributional range.  Speciation processes in the ants may thus be driven either by adaptation towards alternative host species or by spatial patterns of host distribution, or by both factors.  Limited dispersal of queens & nest site limitation due to the obligate association with a host were found to lead to significant isolation by distance on a small spatial scale in primary forest.  Extremely high intraspecific genetic variation of mitochondrial markers was in contrast to the low genetic variability of nuclear markers, also pointing towards small population sizes of the ants & the importance of genetic drift in the diversification processes.  Adaptation towards alternative hosts may occur as a by-product, when different Macaranga hosts are colonized in different regions.]",

    "abstract": "In the Brazilian Cerrado, Coelocephalapion weevils induce galls on the leaves of Croton antisyphiliticus (Euphorbiaceae). Gall induction results in dozens of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) being produced on the gall surface. This plant has a low number of EFNs at the margin of its healthy leaves. The interaction weevil-plant induces the overproduction of EFNs on the galls. The presence of glands on leaves and galls in the same plant is a rare condition in nature. We examined the EFNs on young and old leaves and on the surface of young and old galls, and described the trichomes and stomata on leaves and galls on C. antisyphiliticus. To measure the differences in structures we used digital photographs and standard scanning electron microscopy. Two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tuckey tests were used to compare their number and size of EFNs. We found more EFNs on galls than on leaves. No stomata or trichomes were found on the EFNs surface. The size and shape of the secretory EFNs heads on leaves and galls were different. Trichome density was higher on young and mature galls than on leaves. Trichome secretory heads on leaves are concave, while those on galls are convex. The nuclei of the EFNs epidermal cells of the leaf blade margin occupy smaller areas than those of the petiole and young galls. This study highlights the potential of gall traits that might increase plant defense against galling insects through the overproduction of these glands.",

    "abstract": "1. Seed manipulation by ants can play a key role in seed germination through two main behaviours: elaiosome detachment and seed scarification. Despite the fact that these behaviours are commonplace, their effects have only been quantified independently, and their consequences on seed germination remain controversial. 2. Here we experimentally investigate the effects of ant manipulation on seed germination, disentangling the contributions of these two ant behaviours to this process. To do so, under laboratory conditions, we studied the effects of seed manipulation by Acromyrmex subterraneus on germination of seeds from Mabea fistulifera, a myrmecochorous plant. We established six experimental treatments: (i) unmanipulated seeds; (ii) ant\u0010manipulated seeds with the elaiosome detached and scarified; (iii) ant\u0010manipulated seeds with the elaiosome detached and non\u0010scarified; (iv) hand\u0010manipulated seeds with the elaiosome remaining and scarified; (v) hand\u0010manipulated seeds with the elaiosome detached and scarified; and (vi) hand\u0010manipulated seeds with elaiosome detached and non\u0010scarified. 3. We found that both elaiosome detachment and seed scarification decreased seed germination rates. Moreover, there was no difference in germination rates whether the seeds were manipulated by researcher's hand or by ants, suggesting a lack of other ant\u0010manipulation effects on seeds. 4. The present study shows that manipulation by A. subterraneus can exert negative effects on germination of a myrmecochorous seed. Accordingly, we suggested that studies evaluating the benefits of myrmecochory for plants, based only on seed removal amount and distance, may be overestimating those benefits. Our results contribute to the understanding of the potential mechanisms influencing plant recruitment, especially for myrmecochorous plants inhabiting tropical forests.",

    "abstract": "Myrmecochory (seed dispersal by ants) is a unique seed dispersal syndrome among invertebrates. It comprises three main phases: seed removal, seed manipulation, and seed deposition. However, the contribution of each phase to seed and seedling fate remains unclear. Here, we experimentally quantified the effects of each phase of myrmecochory on seed germination and seedling establishment, the two most critical life history stages involved in plant recruitment. We established 30 sample points, and each included an adult Mabea fistulifera tree, an Atta sexdens nest entrance, and six seed depots. We monitored the germination of M. fistulifera seeds for 3 months and subsequently followed the growth and mortality of the resulting seedlings for 12 months. Only the dispersal distance influenced plant establishment, reducing seed germination and increasing seedling growth, but with no effect of seed manipulation and deposition site. Despite the contrasting effects of distance on seed germination and seedling growth, the positive effect of dispersal distance on seedling growth was ten times greater than the negative effect on seed germination. Moreover, A. sexdens behaved neither as granivore nor as herbivore of M. fistulifera seeds or seedlings, which suggests that seed dispersal by A. sexdens is advantageous to M. fistulifera. Thus, the joint occurrence of these two species in disturbed areas could have a positive effect on this pioneer plant population, which might promote forest regeneration.",

    "abstract": "*[The ant fauna associated with the extrafloral nectaries of O. spectabilis consists of 26 species in 12 genera.  Camponotus ants showed a marked dominance, both in number of species and individuaIs.  There is a clear daily turn over in ant species composition.  The diurnal ant fauna is dominated by Camponotus crassus, Zacryptocerus pusillus, Pseudomyrmex sp.1, Camponotus sp.1, & Camponotus sp.2.   During the night, the principal ant visitors were Camponotus pallescens, C. renggeri, Pheidole sp. 2,  C. abdominalis, Ectatomma edentatum, & C. lespesi.  Plants of O. spectabilis were more intensively visited by ants than neighboring plants lacking extrafloral nectaries.  This difference resulted in many more termites being attacked by ants on Ouratea than on plants without extrafloral nectaries.  Termites were preferably attacked by ants on buds and young leaves.  The foraging for extrafloral nectar probably explains the greater ant activity on plants during months September & October presenting increased numbers of active extrafloral nectaries.  Ant-excluded plants of O. spectabilis had greater numbers of Udranomia caterpillars (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) & higher levels of folivory than plants with free ant access.  Plants without ants also presented increased numbers of herbivores on buds.  The protection afforded by ants to O. spectabilis does not lead to an increased fruit production by the plants.  Ants seem to effectively protect vegetative structures against herbivores in the cerrado.]",

    "abstract": "The pioneer tree Macaranga in SE Asia has developed manyfold associations with ants. The genus comprises all stages of interaction with ants, from facultative relationships to obligate myrmecophytes. Only myrmecophytic Macaranga offer nesting space for ants and are associated with a specific ant partner. The non-myrmecophytic species are visited by a variety of different ant species which are attracted by extrafloral nectaries (EFN) and food bodies. Transitional Macaranga species like M. hosei are colonized later in their development due to their stem structure. Before the colonization by their specific Crematogaster partner the young plants are visited by different ant species attracted by EFN. These nectaries are reduced and food body production starts as soon as colonization becomes possible. We demonstrated earlier that obligate ant partners can protect their Macaranga plants against herbivore damage and vine cover. In this study we focused on non-specific interactions and studied M. tanarius and M. hosei, representing a non-myrmecophyte and a transitional species respectively. In ant exclusion experiments both M. tanarius and M. hosei suffered significantly higher mean leaf damage than controls, 37% versus 6% in M. hosei, 16% versus 7% in M. tanarius. M. tanarius offers both EFN and food bodies so that tests for different effects of these two food rewards could be conducted. Plants with food bodies removed but with EFN remaining had the lowest mean increase of herbivore damage of all experimental groups. Main herbivores on M. hosei were mites and caterpillars. Many M. tanarius plants were infested by a shootborer. Both Macaranga species were visited by various ant species, Crematogaster spp. being the most abundant. We found no evidence for any specific relationship. The result of this study strongly support the hypothesis that non-specific, facultative associations with ants can be advantageous for Macaranga plants. Food bodies appear to have lower attractive value for opportunistic ants than EFN and may require a specific dietary adaptation. This is also indicated by the fact that food body production in the transitional M. hosei does not start before stem structure allows a colonization by the obligate Crematogaster species. M. hosei thus benefits from facultative associations with a variety of ants until it produces its first domatia and can be colonized by its obligate mutualist.",

Our studies have revealed a far more complex system than previously thought. This paper presents the first extensive investigation in the whole distribution area of myrmecophytic Macaranga. All ant-inhabited species were restricted to the moister parts of SE Asia: Peninsular Malaysia, South and East Thailand, Sumatra and Borneo. We found a rather strict and similar altitudinal zonation of myrmecophytic Macaranga species in all regions. Here we focus on the majority of the 19 Macaranga species obligatorily associated with ants of the genus Crematogaster. We identified a total of 2163 ant queens which belonged to at least eight (morpho)species of the small subgenus Decacrema as well as to one non-Decacrema (probably from Atopogyne). The ant species were not randomly distributed among the Macaranga species but distinct patterns of associations emerged. Despite common sympatric distribution of Macaranga species, in most cases a surprisingly high specificity of ant colonization was maintained which was, however, often not species-specific but groups of certain plant species with identical ant partners could be found. These colonization patterns usually but not always mirror existing taxonomic sections within the genus Macaranga. Possible mechanisms of specificity are discussed. The results are compared with other ant-plant mutualisms.",

Extrafloral nectaries were present on 12.3% of the 741 species surveyed,  with 91 plant species belonging to 47 genera, in 16 families having extrafloral nectaries.  Euphorbiaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Rosaceae, Leguminosae, & Ebenaceae were the families most frequently bearing extrafloral nectaries, whereas extrafloral nectaries were rare in the more primitive subclasses of the Magnoliopsida & common in the more advanced taxa, Dilleniidae, Rosidae, & Asteridae.  Most common were flattened glands associated with the leaf blade.  A comparison with data from the Neotropics showed a great similarity in regard to the taxonomic distribution of plants with extrafloral nectaries.   Extrafloral nectary-plants occupied 19.3% of the cover of the Pasoh Forest 50-ha plot.  Species with extrafloral nectaries were under-represented among shrubs and trees of the understory.  We found an increase in the number of species with extrafloral nectaries, as well as in their cover from the understory to the canopy emergents. Extrafloral nectarieswere found more often among the abundant species (species with n more than 500/50 ha).  Percentage occurrence & cover of extrafloral nectary-bearing plants in the 50-ha plot of primary forest was lower than recorded for secondary habitats in tropical areas.  At present, in the core zone of the Pasoh Forest Reserve which has been investigated, only few species known to indicate disturbance occur.  Therefore most of the recorded extrafloral nectaries-species cannot be regarded as secondary forest plants.  The interactions between ants & extrafloral nectaries-bearing plants appear to be rather facultative & nonspecific.  In Pasoh, we found 28 ant species from 7 genera visiting extrafloral nectaries.  Most of the extrafloral nectaries-associated ants belonged to the subfamily Myrmicinae while ponerines were rare, a pattern which was also reported for the Neotropics.]            Details of ant fauna at extrafloral nectaries are recorded IN: Fiala, B., Maschwitz, U., & Linsenmair, K.E., 1994, Diversit\u2030t von Interaktionen zwischen Ameisen und Pflanzen im s\u00b8dostasiatischen Regenwald, Andrias, Karlsruhe 13: 169-78.",

    "abstract": "Associations of ants with plants can be regarded as one reason for the high abundance and diversity of ants in the tropics. The plants either provide food as extrafloral nectar and/or food bodies or, in the true myrmecophytes, nesting space and partly also food. These associations are characterized by very different forms and intensities of use of the plant resources and, therefore, also varying mutual dependency of the partners. A broad spectrum of different ant-plant interactions is found in the paleotropical tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) which is therefore especially suited as a model system for a comparative investigation. The central question of our studies is: Does the mosaic character of the spatial distribution of food and nesting resources provided by the myrmecophilous plants rather favor stochastic processes during colonization of habitats by ants? Or does it, on the contrary, preferentially lead to strong specializations in the ants? Our investigations show that both principles are realized. In interactions where ants only use the food resources, specific relationships are lacking and stochastic events direct the associations. In obligate myrmecophytes, however, the colonization largely follows deterministic principles, especially when nesting space inside the plant actively has to be made accessible by the ants.",

    "abstract": "C. borneensis lives in close association with several myrmecophytic species of the South East Asian pioneer tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae). The ants are adapted to the plants so closely that they do not survive away from it. The only food they utilize is provided as food bodies by the plant and honeydew from specific scale insects kept inside the hollow internodes. The anatomy of the digestive tract is also adapted to life on the host plant: the crop is very small and can store only minute food quantities. Crematogaster borneensis colonizes certain Macaranga species. Queens as well as workers are able to recognize their host plant species, probably by chemical cues. Colony founding queens swarm throughout the year, mostly during darkness. There is strong competition among queens for host plants. Queens do not carry scale insects on their nuptial flight. Worker ants are active day and night. Most of them patrol and collect food bodies on the younger parts of the host plant. An important characteristic is their cleaning behavior, which results in removal of all foreign objects. Even though they are rather small, workers respond very aggressively to certain kinds of disturbance of the host plant. The ants attack most phytophagous insects and are especially effective in killing and removing small, softbodied herbivores (e.g. caterpillars). They do not possess a functional sting, but apply defensive secretion and once biting an intruder will not let go. Their effective alarm system results in a mass attack, which provides adequate defense for the colony and the host plant. A comparison with another Crematogaster species further illustrated the special adaptations of C. borneensis to its host plant.",

    "abstract": "Some species of the paleotropical tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) live in close association with ants. The genus comprises the full range of species from those not regularly inhabited by ants to obligate myrmecophytes. In Malaysia (Peninsular and Borneo) 23 of the 52 species are known to be ant-associated (44%). The simplest structural adaptation of plants to attract ants are extrafloral nectaries. We studied the distribution of extrafloral nectaries in the genus Macaranga to assess the significance of this character as a possible predisposition for the evolution of obligate myrmecophytism. All species have marginal glands on the leaves. However, only the glands of non- myrmecophytic species function as nectaries, whereas liquids secreted by these glands in myrmecophytic species did not contain sugar. Some non-myrmecophytic Macaranga and transitional Macaranga species in addition have extrafloral nectaries on the leaf blade near the petiole insertion. All obligatorily myrmecophytic Macaranga species, however, lack additional glands on the lamina. The non-myrmecophytic species are visited by a variety of different ant species, whereas myrmecophytic Macaranga are associated only with one specific ant-partner. Since these ants keep scale insects in the hollow stems, reduction of nectary production in ant-inhabited Macaranga seems to be biologically significant. We interpret this as a means of (a) saving the assimilates and (b) stabilization of maintenance of the association's specificity. Competition with other ant species for food rewards is avoided and thereby danger of weakening the protective function of the obligate ant- partner for the plant is reduced.A comparison with other euphorb species living in the same habitats as Macaranga showed that in genera in which extrafloral nectaries are widespread, no myrmecophytes have evolved. Possession of extrafloral nectaries does not appear to be essential for the development of symbiotic ant-plant interactions. Other predispositions such as nesting space might have played a more important role.          *[Ants collected from leaves of non-myrmecophytic Macaranga species (number of ant species in brackets):  Dolichoderinae: Dolichoderus sp.

    "abstract": "The production of extrafloral nectar and food bodies plays an important role in many tropical ant-plant mutualisms. In Malaysia, a close association exists between ants and some species of the pioneer tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae). Macaranga is a very diverse genus which exhibits all stages of interaction with ants, from facultative to obligatory associations. The ants nest inside the hollow internodes and feed mainly on food bodies provided by the plants. Food body production had previously been reported only in myrmecophytic Macaranga species, where it is usually concentrated on protected parts of the plants such as recurved stipules. We found that non-myrmecophytic Macaranga species also produce food bodies on leaves and stems, where they are collected by a variety of ants. Levels of food body production differ between facultatively and obligatorily ant-associated species but also among the various non-myrmecophytes. This may be related to the degree of interaction with ants. Food body production starts at a younger age in the myrmecophytic species than in the transitional or non-myrmeccophytic Macaranga. Although food bodies of the non-inhabited Macaranga species are collected by a variety of ants, there is no evidence of association with specific ant species. Our observations suggest that food bodies enhance the evolution of ant-plant interactions. Production of food bodies alone, however, does not appear to be the most important factor for the development of obligate myrmecophytism in Macaranga.",

    "abstract": "In the humid tropics of SE Asia there are some 14 myrmecophytic species of the pioneer tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae). In Peninsula Malaysia a close association exists between the trees and the small, non-stinging myrmecine [sic] Crematogaster borneensis. These ants feed mainly on food bodies provided by the plants and have their colonies inside the hollow internodes. In a ten months field study we were able to demonstrate for four Macaranga species (M. triloba, M. hypoleuca, M. hosei, M. hulletti) that host plants also benefit considerably from ant-occupation. Ants do not contribute to the nutrient demands of their host plant, they do, however, protect it against herbivores and plant competition. Cleaning behavior of the ants results in the removal of potential herbivores already in their earliest developmental stages. Strong aggressiveness and a mass recruiting system enable the ants to defend the host plant against many herbivorous insects. This results in a significant decrease in leaf damage due to herbivores on ant-occupied compared to ant-free myrmecophytes as well as compared to non-myrmecophytic Macaranga species. Most important is the ants\u00a5 defense of the host plant against plant competitors, especially vines, which are abundant in the well-lit pioneer habitats where Macaranga grows. Ants bite off any foreign plant part coming into contact with their host plant. Both ant-free myrmecophytes and non-myrmecophytic Macaranga species had a significantly higher incidence of vine growth than specimens with active ant colonies. This may be a factor of considerable importance allowing Macaranga plants to grow at sites of strongest competition.",

    "abstract": "Many species of Macaranga (Euphorbiacae) are fast-growing pioneer trees with an important role in early succession in south-east Asian rainforests. Within the genus, diverse types of ant-plant associations exist and it has therefore been a model system for studying mutualistic interactions. Little information existed up to now, however, on its reproductive biology. Our comparative study in the genus Macaranga in Sundaland revealed specific flower characteristics and uncommon brood-site pollination systems: enclosed inflorescence morphologies with narrow entrances strongly restrict the set of flower visitors in many species. Thysanoptera were the most abundant insects in 20 of the 26 investigated Macaranga species and, in three species, heteropteran adults and larvae were dominant. Both insect groups used the flower chambers as breeding sites and fed on nectar-producing trichomes inside the bracteoles. Thrips as well as heteropterans are assumed to contribute to pollination. Different Macaranga sections were associated with different flower visitors, suggesting isolation by different pollinators. Thrips pollination and myrmecophyty often occurred in the same sections. The development of enclosed flowers might have facilitated tight ant-plant interactions and prevent ant-pollinator conflicts. However, the complex ecosystems in which the mutualistic systems evolved are rapidly changed with unknown consequences for these specific interactions.",

    "abstract": "Obligate ant-plant interactions are known to be mutualistic but plant-ants that destroy flowers of their hosts have been reported. They were regarded as parasites in myrmecophytic systems. The mechanisms that lead to flower damage (sterilization) by plant-ants are not easy to understand as most sterilizing ants are actually regular colonizers of their plants and normally offer protection against herbivores and/or plant competition. It is difficult to find general patterns of ant or plant traits even in the few yet known associations of flower sterilization. We here present the first study from Southeast Asia where flower sterilizing occurs in the complex mutualistic Macaranga-Crematogaster system that differs from other cases. Flowers of M. hullettii in the Gombak Valley were destroyed by all three associated specific and otherwise protective Crematogaster species. The hypotheses that limitation of nesting space or food are main proximate factors for flower destruction were not strongly supported in our study system. Ants are even attracted to flowers by special food bodies produced by the plants. Only younger, not yet reproductive colonies were found to destroy flowers but not colonies with alates, indicating that flower sterilization behavior may only occur when the onset of host reproduction precedes ant reproduction, perhaps leading to a change in ant behavior. Fruit set always occurred in larger trees, and saplings for colonizing ant queens were therefore always present in the local population, stabilizing the association.",

    "abstract": "Food bodies are produced by a variety of tropical and subtropical plant species. They have long been hypothezised to attract ants and function as ant food although their collection has so far been directly observed only in a few plant species. Usually these are involved in highly specialized ant-plant associations where they perform an essential role in the maintenance of mutualisms. In contrast to another ant-related feature in ant-plant interactions -extrafloral nectaries- only little information exist on food bodies. Comparative investigations on their abundance, distribution and function are lacking. We have started studies on the occurence of food bodies in the family Vitaceae in Malaysia. Here we compare 7 species: Leea indica, Cayratia japonica, C. mollissima, Cissus repens, Tetrastigma pedunculare, T. lanceolarium and T. leucostaphylum (all except Leea being climbers; second growth habitats are particularly prevalent). Food bodies were rarely found during field observations where insects continously had access to the plants but were obvious on plants grown in the greenhouse or when ants were excluded. All species studied produced food bodies on the lower surface of the leaves. Additionally, food bodies were located on other plant parts (such as petioles of leaves, flowers and fruits, buds, tendrils, also on fruits). The species differed in number, size and also shape of their food bodies. Preliminary tests for glucose, protein and lipids indicated differences in nutrient contents and concentrations. Two species, in addition, provide sugary secretions from extrafloral nectaries as a complementary energy source. All 7 plant species were visited by a number of different ant species. The actual collection of food bodies was observed in several species (incl. Crematogaster spp., Diacamma rugosum, Polyrhachis spp.) (...)",

    "abstract": "Members of the Euphorbiaceae are ecologically important elements of Southeast Asian forests. Species of the pioneer tree genus Macaranga, which is also known for its association with ants, are often abundant in disturbed areas. Phylogenetic studies suggested a recent radiation of section Pachystemon which comprises the majority of obligate myrmecophytes within Macaranga. In the present study, we analyzed the genetic structure of three closely related species of this section (M. constricta, M. griffithiana, and M. motleyana) with the aim of resolving their controversial taxonomy and historical biogeography. Chloroplast DNA haplotypes proved to be species-specific and showed a strong phylogeographic pattern. Nuclear microsatellite data supported the taxonomic distinctness of M. griffithiana and M. motleyana, but gave ambiguous results for M. constricta. Genetic differentiation was stronger each within M. griffithiana and M. motleyana than between M. constricta and M. griffithiana, highlighting problems of defining species boundaries. We found no indication for introgression or hybridization events. The high intraspecific morphological variation of the Bornean endemic M. motleyana was partly reflected by similar patterns of genetic variation. The pronounced genetic structure indicates a comparatively long diversification for this species. In contrast, the weak genetic differentiation within M. griffithiana, as well as the widespread distribution of its most common chloroplast haplotype from peninsular Malaysia up to Indochina, indicates a recent expansion in this area. Despite their morphological similarity and close relatedness, all species possess their own specific ant-partners with a corresponding distribution pattern.",

The majority of species observed so far are facultative myrmecophiles that interact unspecifically with a broad range of ant taxa. A few cases of obligate myrmecophily have been detected, including the polyphagous herbivore Rapala dieneces and two aphytophagous members of the genus Logania (Miletinae). Myrmecoxeny, i.e. lack of ant-association, is rare among Oriental lycaenids, but was confirmed for two species. Together with data from available literature, these findings suggest that in tropical rainforests the proportion of obligate myrmecophiles is not much higher than in the northern temperate zone. Therefore, myrmecophily has probably contributed little to the speciation events themselves, but its role in maintaining species diversity through resource partitioning and niche segregation remains to be discovered.]",

Although numerous studies have addressed the variation in the communities of floral visitors through space, none of them have analyzed how the structure of the community of floral visitors for all the co-flowering annual plant species changes between sites. We describe how the community of floral visitors to annual plants varies through space in a xeric community in central Mexico. We collected all the insects visiting the flowers of the annual plants growing in 2 sites with contrasting plant density (low vs. high). We determined species richness, abundance, and diversity for the insect communities in each site. We established the similarity in the composition of the insect communities and the importance of environmental variables on the dynamics of the communities of floral visitors. Abundance and diversity of floral visitors were significantly higher in the low plant density site. The composition of the insect communities differed between sites (similarity = 32%). Changes in abundance of a few groups of insects seem to be related to environmental factors such as disturbance (Myrmecocystus mexicanus Wesmael [Hymenoptera: Formicidae] and Tiphiidae sp. 1 [Hymenoptera]), humidity (Curculionidae sp. 1 [Coleoptera]), and temperature (Dorymyrmex grandulus (Forel) [Hymenoptera: Formicidae]). Our results indicate that vegetation density has a strong effect on the community of floral visitors of annual plants, which in turn, might affect their reproduction and their interactions with other organisms within the ecosystem.",

Inflorescences of the three Asteraceae were visited by a total of 96 species of Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Total species richness of floral visitors to the three Asteraceae and total abundance of insects of Fl. pedata and P. bipinnatifidum did not differ between low and high vegetation cover sites. Total abundance of insects visiting the inflorescences of F. ramosissima and abundance of Hymenoptera in all three Asteraceae were higher at the low vegetation coverage (LVC) site than at the high vegetation coverage (HVC) one. Diversity of insects of Fl. pedata and P. bipinnatifidum was higher at the HVC site. However, in F. ramosissima diversity was higher at the LVC site. The communities of insects of each Asteraceae were dissimilar between sites. These differences can be attributed to variation in the abundance of Lepidophora (Diptera: Bombyliidae), Miridae (Hemiptera), Melyridae (Coleoptera), Tiphiidae (Hymenoptera), Myrmecocystus mexicanus Wesmael, and Dorymyrmex grandulus (Forel) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae).

Plants that produce high-quality elaiosomes benefit because ants preferentially disperse their diaspores. We therefore hypothesized that seeds and elaiosomes differ in chemical composition in ways that make elaiosomes of high nutritional quality for ants, capable of providing essential dietary components that explain the increased fitness and higher gyne production documented for colonies with elaiosome consumption. To test the hypothesis we analysed the content and composition of lipids, amino acids, soluble carbohydrates, proteins and starch in seeds and elaiosomes of 15 central European ant-dispersed plants. After separating the different fractions, total lipids were determined gravimetrically, fatty acids and soluble carbohydrates were detected by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry, free amino acids by an amino acid analyser while starch and protein were analysed photometrically. Seeds accumulated high molecular weight compounds such as proteins and starch, whereas elaiosomes accumulated more easily digestible low molecular weight compounds such as amino acids and monosaccharides. Analysis of similarities and similarity percentages analysis demonstrated that the composition of fatty acids, free amino acids and carbohydrates differed markedly between elaiosomes and seeds. The most important difference was in total amino acid content, which was on average 7.5 times higher in elaiosomes than in seeds. The difference was especially marked for the nitrogen-rich amino acid histidine. The availability of essential nutrients and, in some species, the higher nitrogen content in elaiosomes suggest that their nutritional value for larvae plays a key role in this interaction.",

These plants produce small single-celled food bodies (FBs) in leaf domatia, formed by the petiole bases and roofing leaf sheaths. In the present study the dependency of ants on FBs of Piper fimbriulatum as a food source was analysed by comparing the natural abundance of 13C and 15N in ants and FBs. Both \u00a513C and \u00a515N values were very similar between FBs and Pheidole bicornis ants but differed substantially between the plant and other ant species. Therefore we suggest that FBs are a main food source for Pheidole bicornis ants. To strengthen this suggestion, the chemical composition of FBs of four myrmecophytic Piper species was analysed, with special emphasis on the nutritional requirements of inhabiting Pheidole bicornis ants. Standard chemical methods were modified and combined to a novel analysis scheme by which all major FB constituents could be quantified from minute [3-10 mg dry mass (DM)] quantities. Piper FBs mainly consisted of lipids (41-48% of DM) and proteins (17-24% of DM). Soluble carbohydrates and amino acids proved to be quantitatively unimportant. N was predominantly stored as soluble protein and, thus, was easily available to the ants. FBs proved to be a high-energy food source (up to 23 kJ g-1 DM), with a chemical composition that meets well the nutritional needs of the inhabiting ants.",

    "abstract": "Mutualism is an often complex interaction among multiple species, each of which may respond differently to abiotic conditions. The effects of temperature on the formation, dissolution, and success of these and other species interactions remain poorly understood. We studied the thermal ecology of the mutualism between the cactus Ferocactus wislizeni and its ant defenders (Forelius pruinosus, Crematogaster opuntiae, Solenopsis aurea, and Solenopsis xyloni) in the Sonoran Desert, USA. The ants are attracted to extrafloral nectar produced by the plants and, in exchange, protect the plants from herbivores; there is a hierarchy of mutualist effectiveness based on aggression toward herbivores. We determined the relationship between temperature and ant activity on plants, the thermal tolerance of each ant species, and ant activity in relation to the thermal environment of plants. Temperature played a role in determining which species interact as mutualists. Three of the four ant species abandoned the plants during the hottest part of the day (up to 40-degrees C), returning when surface temperature began to decrease in the afternoon. The least effective ant mutualist, F. pruinosus, had a significantly higher critical thermal maximum than the other three species, was active across the entire range of plant surface temperatures observed (13.8-57.0-degrees C), and visited plants that reached the highest temperatures. F. pruinosus occupied some plants full-time and invaded plants occupied by more dominant species when those species were thermally excluded. Combining data on thermal tolerance and mutualist effectiveness provides a potentially powerful tool for predicting the effects of temperature on mutualisms and mutualistic species.",

    "abstract": "*[My focal species was the extrafloral nectary-bearing plant, Colubrina spinosa (Rhamnaceae), a neotropical treelet on which I observed 69 ant species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.  To assess competition for mutualists, I excluded ants from conspecific neighbors & followed ant abundance on focal plants.  To consider long-term facilitation, in which greater local nectar resources increase local ant abundance, I manipulated nectar resources in a 2-year field experiment & estimated ant abundance on C. spinosa plants & on baits.  Considering local neighbor density both within a 1m radius & in 5x5 m plots, ant densities on C. spinosa plants showed evidence for a small-scale competition effect & a contrasting plot-level facilitation effect.  The small-scale competition was sized-based; smaller plants lost ants to larger plants.  Ant benefit to plants also depended on plant size.  For larger plants, those with greater size-adjusted ant density had higher growth & survival than those with fewer ants than expected for their size. To determine whether these contrasting competition and facilitation effects could impact population growth or densities, I modeled population dynamics with an integral projection model.  Growth & survival were functions of ant density, which in turn depended on conspecific neighbors, plant size, & mean background ants.  Results suggest that larger-scale facilitation of mutualists impacts long-term population growth more than small-scale competition.  Population growth rate increased with increasing background ant density, which depended on facilitation at the 5x5m plot scale.  In contrast, small-scale competition caused a redistribution of mutualist ants among plants of different sizes, but had very little effect on long-term population growth.]",

Using an experiment with artificial nectaries, we observed that ants foraging on food sources with higher concentration of sugar are quicker in finding and attacking potential herbivorous insects. More specifically, we found that the same ant species may increase their defence effectiveness according to the quality of food available. These findings indicate that ant effectiveness in plant protection is context-dependent and may vary according to specific individual characteristics of plants. In addition, we showed that competitively superior ant species tend to dominate plants in periods with high nectar activity, emphasizing the role of the dominance hierarchy structuring ant-plant interactions. However, when high sugar food sources were experimentally available ad libitum, the nocturnal and competitively superior ant species, Camponotus atriceps, did not dominate the artificial nectaries during the day possibly due to limitation of its thermal tolerance. Therefore, temporal niche partitioning may be allowing the coexistence of two dominant ant species (Camponotus rubrithorax during the day and C. atriceps at night) on V. constricta. Our findings indicate that the quality of the food source, and temporal shifts in ant dominance are key factors which structure the biotic plant defences in an arid environment.          *[Camponotus rubrithorax misspelled Camponotus rubritorax.]",

In a controlled feeding experiment with four different feeding regimes, we supplemented the respective diet of a fraction of the nests with the elaiosome-bearing seeds of C. majus and Scilla bifolia. Here, ant workers carried seeds to their nest and fed elaiosome pieces to their larvae. Subsequent production of sexual offspring and dry weights of sexual pupae were positively correlated with increasing feeding frequencies. With supplementary elaiosome feeding, the female dry weight was significantly higher, whereas the male dry weight decreased. Our results indicate a nutritional benefit from elaiosomes to the ants, which may cause shifts of investment, and at the same time underline the ecological relevance of Temnothorax ants for elaiosome-bearing plants.",

The saplings are shade-tolerant, surviving in a suppressed state for several years in the rainforest understorey, the hollow leaf rachis and petiole being inhabited by the stinging ant Pseudomyrmex concolor (Pseudomyrmecinae). An experiment was designed (a) to evaluate the role of insect herbivory in the mutualism between T. myrmecophila and P. concolor and (b) to test a falsifiable hypothesis proposed by a current trade-off model of chemical and ant defenses which predicts that myrmecophytic traits should be limited to plants with leaves of low longevity. 2 Plants from which the ants were experimentally removed had 4.3 times more herbivorous insects than plants with ants. All recorded orders of insects were attacked similarly by the ants. Rates of herbivory were: (a) ten times higher on experimental plants lacking ants, (b) about three times higher on immature than mature leaves, (c) about two and a half times higher in the wet than the dry season. After 18 months, the experimental plants presented an accumulated level of leaf herbivory which was about twice as high as for the plants with ants. 3 Observations on the phenology of control, experimental, and naturally unoccupied plants revealed that the leaf longevity of plants with active ant colonies was unexpectedly high for rainforest (81 months), and about 1.8 and 2.6 times as high as the experimental (45 months) and the naturally unoccupied (31 months) plants, respectively. The high leaf longevity of the myrmecophytic T. myrmecophila does not support the current trade-off model of chemical and ant defenses. The rate. of apical growth was 1.6 times higher for plants with ants than plants from the experimental group. The slow growth rate of T. myrmecophila, about 14 cm year-1, is compatible with the resource availability hypothesis. 4 Phenological differences between experimental and naturally unoccupied plants suggest that descriptive-correlative studies would not always give a true picture and that the actual paradigm of ant-plant interactions, derived in part from this approach, should be carefully revised. 5 The results corroborate the hypothesis that the interaction between Tachigali myrmecophila and Pseudomyrmex concolor is mutualistic, and suggest that attack by phytophagous insects is the prime factor in the evolution of the myrmecophytism.",

Second at the colony level, in 8 independent ant-myrmecophyte systems, ant colony size was positively correlated to the number of domatia provided by the host, & the mean occupancy level of the domatia by ants was 92%, suggesting that space can be limiting to colony growth.  Third at the population level, ant colony number & distribution was determined by the local availability & distribution of its plant partners.  Fourth at the community level, across ant-myrmecophyte systems, the commonness of ant species were largely determined by the commonness of their specialized host partners.

    "abstract": "The impact of mutualists on a partner's demography depends on how they affect the partner's multiple vital rates and how those vital rates, in turn, affect population growth. However, mutualism studies rarely measure effects on multiple vital rates or integrate them to assess the ultimate impact on population growth. We used vital rate data, population models and simulations of long-term population dynamics to quantify the demographic impact of a guild of ant species on the plant Ferocactus wislizeni. The ants feed at the plant's extrafloral nectaries and attack herbivores attempting to consume reproductive organs. Ant-guarded plants produced significantly more fruit, but ants had no significant effect on individual growth or survival. After integrating ant effects across these vital rates, we found that projected population growth was not significantly different between unguarded and ant-guarded plants because population growth was only weakly influenced by differences in fruit production (though strongly influenced by differences in individual growth and survival). However, simulations showed that ants could positively affect long-term plant population dynamics through services provided during rare but important events (herbivore outbreaks that reduce survival or years of high seedling recruitment associated with abundant precipitation). Thus, in this seemingly clear example of mutualism, the interaction may actually yield no clear benefit to plant population growth, or if it does, may only do so through the actions of the ants during rare events. These insights demonstrate the value of taking a demographic approach to studying the consequences of mutualism.",

A case study on the interaction between ants, EFN-bearing plants and hemipterans was investigated along a gradient of increasing disturbance from regenerated forest to mixed crop field. Ants, EFN-bearing plants and hemipterans sampling was conducted in these vegetations during the wet and the dry seasons in five locations. Results showed that partitioning of ant species between season and vegetation was significantly different from random. High specialization index was observed in hemipterans/plants and ant/hemipterans interactions. Low specialization index was observed between ants and EFN-bearing plants mainly in the mixed crop field. Ant species were mostly found in non-aggressive co-occurrence at nectar sources. At the species level, specialization index was high for Anoplolepis tenella (0.86 +- 0.06) and also for its associated hemipterans Stictococcus vayssierei (0.97 +- 0.02). This association is detrimental to food crop especially cassava.

We investigated geographical variation in the interaction among Crotalaria pallida (Leguminosae: Papilionideae), its specialized herbivore, Utetheisa ornatrix L. (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), and ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). First, we used common-garden experiments with plants collected in different sites at different geographical scales to test for differences among populations in C. pallida attractiveness to ants. When we compared three populations from Southeast Brazil (150 km apart), the number of visiting ants per plant, and the percent of termite baits attacked by ants, were significantly different among plant populations. In a comparison of populations from SE Brazil and Florida (USA), there was no significant difference between the populations in the number of ants per plant or the frequency of baits attacked. Second, we tested in a common garden if U. ornatrix larvae present any behavior to avoid ant predation, and if there were genetic differences among populations. We observed that most larvae moved away from the vicinity of the EFNs (flowers and fruits) to the plant leaves. Of the larvae that moved to leaves, only 10% were attacked by ants while 89% of larvae that stayed near the fruit/flower were attacked. There was a significant difference among populations in the frequency of larvae that moved to the leaves and the frequency of larvae attacked by ants. We discuss the possible causes of the geographical differences observed and propose future research directions in this system.",

    "abstract": "Seed dispersal by ants is an important ecological process that maintains the structure and diversity of natural communities, however, it is vulnerable to biological invasions. Argentine ants are one of the worst invasive ant species and cause severe changes in ecosystem processes and native ant biodiversity declines in invaded sites. Here, we studied seed removal by ants combining observations and a cafeteria experiment with seeds of four myrmecochorous plant species (Centaurea sphaerocephala, Rosmarinus officinalis, Silybum marianum, and Ulex australis) in two sites (invaded and uninvaded) located in the Mediterranean Montado ecosystem and classified as High Nature Value farmland (HNV). Significant differences in daily seed removal rates were found between the two study sites. In uninvaded sites, several native ant species were attracted to the seeds, resulting in all seeds being removed rapidly. The majority of seed removal events were carried out by two key seed disperses Pheidole pallidula (71%) and Aphaenogaster iberica (26%) with a clear preference for diaspored with larger and heavier elaiosome (i.e., C. sphaerocephala, S. marianum). By contrast, while the Argentine ant showed some interest (68% of seeds were interacted with), no seed removal events were observed. The extirpation of the local ant fauna by the Argentine ant and its inability to ensure seed dispersal services may lead to the interference and eventually to the collapse of seed dispersal of the four studied myrmecochorous plants in the invaded site in the future. We argue that these discrete but severe consequences of an invasive species on a key ecological process may strongly affect the functioning of the Montado ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "A major question in ecology is: how do mutualisms between species affect population dynamics? For four years, we monitored populations of two Amazonian myrmecophytes, Cordia nodosa and Duroia hirsuta, and their symbiotic ants. In this system, we investigated how positive feedback between mutualistic plants and ant colonies influenced population processes at two scales: (1) how modular organisms such as plants and ant colonies grew, or \u2211\u0010demography, and (2) how populations grew, or N\u0010demography. We found evidence of positive feedback between ant colony and plant growth rates. Plants with mutualistic ants (Azteca spp. and Myrmelachista schumanni) grew in a geometric or autocatalytic manner, such that the largest plants grew the most. By contrast, the growth of plants with parasitic ants (Allomerus octoarticulatus) saturated. Ant colonies occupied new domatia as fast as plants produced them, suggesting that mutualistic ant colonies also grew geometrically or autocatalytically to match plant growth. Plants became smaller when they lost ants. While unoccupied, plants continued to become smaller until they had lost all or nearly all their domatia. Hence, the loss of mutualistic ants limited plant growth. C. nodosa and D. hirsuta live longer than their ant symbionts and were sometimes recolonized after losing ants, which again promoted plant growth. Plant growth had fitness consequences for ants and plants; mortality and fecundity depended on plant size. Positive feedback between ants and plants allowed a few plants and ant colonies to become very large; these probably produced the majority of offspring in the next generation.",

We experimentally generated a broad range of ant-attendance levels & herbivory pressures in a tropical myrmecophyte, Cordia nodosa, which allowed exploration of the inducibility of & interactions between direct & indirect resistance traits.  In response to increased herbivory, host plants encouraged indirect (biotic) defence by increasing domatium volume, regardless of whether ants were present on the plant.  When ants were present, larger domatia housed more workers, which in turn decreased herbivory on adjacent leaves.  Independent of the presence of ants, plants responded to increased herbivory by inducing both chemical (phenolics) & structural (leaf toughness, trichomes) resistance traits; these traits were associated with reduced palatability to a folivorous beetle.  Our results show that both direct & indirect defences are inducible in C. nodosa, which suggests that C. nodosa may retain direct defences as insurance against varying levels of protection from its ant bodyguards.]",

We did not detect a cost to ant colonies of defending host plants against herbivores.

First to fourth instar larvae construct frass chains, where they rest immune from attacks by foraging ants that climb on Carvocar for its nectary secretions.  While feeding on leaves, however, caterpillars may be killed & removed by foraging ants.  When attacked by ants, Eunica caterpillars may repel their aggressors by resurgitating and/or bleeding.  Ants receiving these fluids exhibited strong disturbance & conspicuously cleaned their mandibles and head.  Dropping off the plant & hanging on the end of a silk thread was also observed in Eunica larvae, after successive bites from the ants.  Ant foraging on Carvocar strongly influences the behavior & survival of Eunica larvae, as well as the oviposition behavior of adult females.  Eggs are preferentially laid on plantas without ants, or with low ant visitation rates.  Eggs are not removed by ants, but predation on larvae (particularly early instars) ia very common.  Eunica females were shown to visually avoid ovipositing on plants with high ant visitation; plant branches with artificial rubber ants were less infested than control branches with rubber circles.

The results showed that developmental time from flowering to emergence of the underground capsules above the soil was about 35 days, & emergence of the underground capsules results from elongation of the peduncles, & then capsules dehisce & seeds are dispersed.

The visiting frequency of F. pressilabris was the highest, but F. fusca removed seeds faster & to a greater distance than the other 2 species.  The average dispersal distance of the 3 ant species was 62.4+-1.7 cm.  Formica pressilabris (the major ant species taking seeds) ate the elaiosome after it moved the seeds into its nest & then stored more than 50% of the transported seeds in the nest.  Formation of seeds underground & their dispersal by ants help ensure that seeds escape damage from herbivores & fire, & that they are dispersed in a manner that reduces sib-competition & mother plant-offspring competition, thereby ensuring seed germination & seedling establishment in suitable environments.]",

    "abstract": "Many remnants of tropical forests are surrounded by deforested areas dominated by successional vegetation. Although secondary dispersal by scatter-hoarding rodents and ants may influence seed predation and seedling recruitment, very little is known about its importance in degraded forest ecosystems.  We studied the effects of secondary dispersal on seed predation, germination and seedling recruitment of the primarily bird-dispersed tree Clusia trochiformis in a tropical montane forest in Bolivia. We carried out exclosure experiments that allowed or excluded access to seeds by vertebrates in three habitat types (forest interior, degraded habitat close to and degraded habitat far from the forest margin) in a spatial block design at six sites. We offered a total of 1440 seeds (both with and without an aril) and marked half of them with a thread to follow their fate after 48 h and after 1 month.  We found that secondary dispersal by ants was highest in the forest interior but was also frequent in degraded habitats close to and far from the forest edge. Secondary dispersal significantly increased seedling recruitment, particularly in the degraded habitats, probably because seeds were often dispersed to sites beneath the leaf litter. Recruitment success increased significantly with dispersal distance. High recruitment of secondarily dispersed seeds in the degraded habitat was due to the combined effect of reduced predation and increased germination of seeds that had been moved by ants.  Synthesis. In the absence of secondary dispersal, seed germination and seedling recruitment were very low in degraded habitats. Seed dispersal by ants substantially increased natural regeneration in the deforested habitats. Our experiments thus demonstrate that the effects of biotic interactions on plant demography can vary across habitat boundaries at small spatial scales and that secondary dispersal is a crucial and overlooked process that can aid the regeneration of deforested habitats in the tropics.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that chemicals on plant elaiosomes aid seed detection by seed-dispersing ants. We hypothesized that the chemical interaction between ants and elaiosomes is more intimate than a generic attraction, and that elaiosome chemicals will attract mutualistic but not granivorous ant species. We investigated this by using two gorse species, Ulex minor and U. europaeus, and two associated ant species from European heathlands, the mutualist Myrmica ruginodis and the granivore Tetramorium caespitum. Behavioral studies were conducted with laboratory nests and foraging arenas. Both ants will take Ulex seeds, but while M. ruginodis showed increased antennation toward ether extracts of elaiosome surface chemicals compared with controls, T. caespitum showed no response. Elaiosome extracts were separated into seven lipid fractions. M. ruginodis showed increased antennation only toward the diglyceride fractions of both Ulex species, whereas T. caespitum showed no consistent reaction. This indicates that M. ruginodis can detect the elaiosome by responding to its surface chemicals, but T. caespitum is unresponsive to these chemicals. Responses to surface chemicals could increase the rate of seed detection in the field, and so these results suggest that Ulex elaiosomes produce chemicals that facilitate attraction of mutualistic rather than granivorous ant species. This could reduce seed predation and increase Ulex fitness.",

This temporal specificity of nectar gland activity is shown to facilitate seed dispersal by ants, which are attracted to the plant only during the fruit maturation period.  The nectar glands establish a nectar influence zone with a radius of 60 cm around the plant within which seed dispersal by ants is effective.  Seed dispersal by ants is facilitated only if the seeds are placed within this nectar influence zone.  This is accomplished by an intriguing evolutionary shift in the maturation pattern of the fruits.  Fruit maturation in Croton is temporally asymmetrical, with the fruits nearer the parental axis maturing early.  This unique pattern of fruit development together with the polychasial branching system leads to a concentration of seeds within the nectar influence zone & enhances seed dispersal by ants.]",

Some qualitative factors of this mutualistic ant-plant interaction may account for their effectiveness: the small size of the ants, their high visitation rate to pistillate flowers, & the lack of reduction in viability of the pollen transported on the integument.

    "abstract": "*[The weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina is a keystone predator in SE Asian forests.  It uses the flowers of a wide range of native & introduced plant species as hunting platforms for incoming pollinators.  Weaver ants affect the behavior of flower visitors & the reproductive success of their host plants.  The presence of predatory ants caused alterations in the size & topological properties of networks, such as web asymmetry or nestedness, through the behavioual changes they induce on floral visitors.  Behavioral assays revealed that Melastoma malabathricum flowers, pollinated by large carpenter bees, Xylocopa spp., produce ant attractants that recruit weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina.  The presence of ants was associated with an increase in the reproductive success of M.  malabathricum flowers.  This outcome likely resulted from the filtering effect of ants on the community of flower visitors: ants deter less effective pollinators & attract Xylocopa bees through an indirect effect on resource depletion.  We previously reported that the reproductive success was greater at plants with than without ant nests.  The effect was mediated through the behavior of foraging bees: small bees (ineffective pollinators) avoided plants with ants where they were exposed to predation risk, & large bees (the most effective pollinators) concentrated their foraging on plants with ants, where resource competition was lowest.  Two years later, when bee density was lower, small bees still avoided ant-harboring plants, but there were so few of them that they had little effect on resource depletion & large bees visited plants with & without ants at similar rates.  As a result, plant reproductive success was similar at plants with & without weaver ant nests, & lower than when bees were abundant.  Tritrophic interactions may therefore show variability in the magnitude & direction of selective pressures.  A mathematical model showed that solitary bees should increase flower examination time in response to predator cues & that the rate of false alarms should be negatively correlated with the relative value of the flower explored.  The predatory ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, & the harmless ant, Polyrhachis dives, differ in the profile of volatiles they emit & in their visual appearance.  As predicted, the solitary bee Nomia strigata spent more time examining virgin flowers in presence of predator cues than in their absence.  The proportion of flowers rejected decreased from morning to noon, as the relative value of virgin flowers increased.  In addition, bees responded differently to visual & chemical cues.  While chemical cues induced bees to search around flowers, bees detecting visual cues hovered in front of them.]",

The prey spectra also differ among plant species & between ontogenetic morphotypes in their combinations of ants, flying insects, termites, & noninsect guilds.  According to a discriminant analysis, the Nepenthes species collected at the same site differ significantly in prey abundance and composition at the level of order, showing niche segregation, but with varying degrees of niche overlap according to pairwise species comparisons.  Weakly carnivorous species are first characterized by an absence of attractive traits.  Generalist carnivorous species have a sweet odor, a wide pitcher aperture, & an acidic pitcher fluid.  Guild specializations are explained by different combinations of morpho-functional traits.  Ant captures increase with extrafloral nectar, fluid acidity, & slippery waxy walls.  Termite captures increase with narrowness of pitchers, presence of a rim of edible trichomes, & symbiotic association with ants.  The ants found in the Nepenthes traps belonged to subfamilies Dolichoderinae, Formicinae, Myrmicinae, & Pseudomyrmicinae.

We dissected domatia of juvenile host-plants that had not yet acquired an established colony to determine how colonies are founded, & when & how trophobionts are acquired.  Colony foundation is claustral.  A single queen chews an entrance hole into an unoccupied domatium that serves as the founding chamber.  The entrance hole is partially closed by debris & later by callus growth.  Nineteen foundresses were located while still in the claustral phase, with no workers or a few nanitic workers.  Of the 19 foundresses, 12 had at least a single Paraputo anomala individual in the same domatium.  One of the queens had 2 female P. anomala nymphs attached to her body.  The remaining 7 foundresses were not associated with coccoids.  These results indicate that mealybug & ant may codisperse by phoresis of juvenile female mealybugs on founding queens.

Behavioral observations help to explain the difference between the effects of the 2 ant species.

Petalomyrmex workers patrolled young leaves constantly (day & night) & chased out or killed microlepidopteran larvae placed on young leaves.  The patrolling activity of Cataulacus was only diurnal (rather well correlated with the activity of nectar production), & Cataulacus workers failed to consistently attack herbivores.

Total investment in pupae was greater for ant colonies that tended solely or primarily coccids than for those that tended pseudococcids.  In particular, biomass invested in sexuals increased more rapidly with size of the colony in trees where ants tended coccids.  This greater investment in sexuals was not made at the expense of investment in workers, but reflected increased resources available to coccid-tending colonies.  Higher reproductive output indicates that ant fitness may be greater when they tend coccids.  These additional resources led to a greater increase in production of alate females than in that of males.  Consequently, the sex investment ratio of coccid-tending colonies was more female biased than in those that tended pseudococcids.  Differences in resource supply affected numbers of individuals produced but not per-individual investment, with one partial exception: in very small colonies, pseudococcid-tending colonies produced small workers while coccid-tending colonies did not, further underlining the higher resource supply to coccid-tending colonies.]",

Our estimates take into account not only direct damage, such as removal of leaf surface by chewing insects, but also the effects of sucking insects on leaf growth & expansion.  Sucking insects are numerically predominant in this system, & the hitherto cryptic effects of ant protection against the growth-reducing effects of sucking insects accounted for half of the total estimated benefit of ant protection.  We propose that the small size of workers confers a distinct advantage in this system.

    "abstract": "The fitness advantage provided by caulinary domatia to myrmecophytes has never been directly demonstrated because most myrmecophytic species do not present any individual variation in the presence of domatia and the removal of domatia from entire plants is a destructive process. The semi-myrmecophytic tree, Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae), is an ideal species to investigate the selective advantage conferred by domatia because within the same population, some plants are devoid of domatia while others bear them. Several ant species patrol the plant for extra-floral nectar. Fruit production was found to be enhanced in domatia-bearing trees compared to trees devoid of domatia independent of the ant associate. However, this domatium effect was most conspicuous for trees associated with the populous and nomadic ant, Technomyrmex albipes. This species is a frequent associate of H. brunonis, inhabiting its domatia or building carton nests on it. Ant exclusion experiments revealed that T. albipes was the only ant to provide efficient anti-herbivore protection to the leaves of its host tree. Measures of ant activity as well as experiments using caterpillars revealed that the higher efficiency of T. albipes was due to its greater patrolling density and consequent shorter lag time in attacking the larvae. T. albipes also provided efficient anti-herbivore protection to flowers since fruit initiation was greater on ant-patrolled inflorescences than on those from which ants were excluded. We therefore demonstrated that caulinary domatia provide a selective advantage to their host-plant and that biotic defense is potentially the main fitness benefit mediated by domatia. However, it is not the sole advantage. The general positive effect of domatia on fruit set in this ant-plant could reflect other benefits conferred by domatia-inhabitants, which are not restricted to ants in this myrmecophyte, but comprise a large diversity of other invertebrates. Our results indicate that mutualisms enhance the evolution of myrmecophytism.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims Mutualistic ant-plant associations are common in a variety of plant families. Some myrmecophytic plants, such as the epiphytic orchid Caularthron bilamellatum , actively form hollow structures that provide nesting space for ants (myrmecodomatia), despite a substantial loss of water-storage tissue. This study aimed at assessing the ability of the orchid to take up nitrogen from ant-inhabited domatia as possible trade-off for the sacrifice of potential water storage capacity. Methods Nitrogen uptake capabilities and uptake kinetics of 15N-labelled compounds (NH4+, urea and l -glutamine) were studied in field-grown Caularthron bilamellatum plants in a tropical moist forest in Panama. Plants were either labelled directly, by injecting substrates into the hollow pseudobulbs or indirectly, by labelling of the associated ants in situ . Key Results Caularthron bilamellatum plants were able to take up all tested inorganic and organic nitrogen forms through the inner surface of the pseudobulbs. Uptake of NH4+ and glutamine followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but urea uptake was not saturable up to 2 m m . 14N-labelled compounds were rapidly translocated and incorporated into vegetative and reproductive structures. By labelling ants with 14N in situ , we were able to prove that ants transfer N to the plants under field conditions. Conclusions Based on 14N labelling experiments we were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that a myrmecophytic orchid is capable of actively acquiring different forms of nitrogen from its domatia and that nutrient flux from ants to plants does indeed occur under natural conditions. This suggests that beyond anti-herbivore protection host plants benefit from ants by taking up nitrogen derived from ant debris.",

They support different communities of specialized parasitic insects (the gall inducers), and can also provide refuge to other insects, such as moths, beetles and ants, referred to as secondary occupants. This study focuses on galls induced by the oak gall wasp Andricus quercustozae and secondarily colonized by ants in a mixed oak forest. A field survey and two experiments were carried out to a) study ant (species-specific) preferences for different features of the galls, b) describe differences in gall architecture due to ant activity, c) analyse the effects of the presence of gall-dwelling ants on plant health. The results show that there are differences between ant species in gall colonization and in the alteration of gall opening and inner structure. We verified that gall-dwelling ants protect their host plants efficiently, offering them an indirect defence mechanism against enemies (predators and pathogens). The data suggest a new paradigm in ant&ndash;plant relationships mediated by the presence of galls on the plants whose ecological and evolutionary implications are discussed.",

The ants Crematogaster scutellaris, Colobopsis truncata and Temnothorax italicus frequently used the galls as nests: Crematogaster scutellaris occupied galls which were located higher on the oak trees, while C. truncata and T. italicus were located at lower positions. In addition, galls occupied by C. scutellaris showed varied internal architecture in relation to the colony composition. Importantly, field surveys revealed for the first time that C. scutellaris nest galls also contained live individuals of the non-galligenous aphid Panaphis juglandis. Field experiments suggested that the ants actively seek, collect and stock live aphids. No signs of predation and injuries were detected on the stored aphids, which were probably kept for safe overwintering, though we cannot exclude a possible occasional use as food.

C. truncata built larger entrance holes with a more central position, apparently facilitating the defensive ability of the phragmotic soldiers, while the smaller nest entrance hole by T. italicus were located in a lateral position.

To assess the constitutive level of Azteca defense in Cecropia obtusifolia trees, we recorded the number of ants patrolling undamaged leaves. To evaluate the induced level of Azteca defense, the same leaves were subjected to simulated herbivory by punching circular holes in them. We recorded the maximum number of ants patrolling the damaged leaves from 2 to 15 min after damage. Past herbivory (% defoliation of old leaves) was assumed to indicate a risk of herbivory. Regression analyses showed that, whereas the constitutive level of ant patrolling was positively associated with the magnitude of herbivory on old leaves, there was a negative association between the magnitude of induced ant defense and past herbivory. These preliminary results lend support to ODT.",

    "abstract": "Ecological restoration aims to re-establish both biodiversity and ecological function in damaged ecosystems. Ants are important drivers of ecological functions and are early colonizers of restored ecosystems. Rates at which ants perform functions are thought to be fuelled by access to plant sugars. In revegetated farmland in south-eastern Australia, I tested if ant activity on trees, which reflects use of arboreal sugars, follows a predictable trajectory of recovery towards a remnant-like state. Additionally, I examined whether planting method alters this trajectory by comparing tube stock (TS), which results in low Eucalyptus densities, with direct seeding (DS), which results in high Eucalyptus densities. Replicate sites (n = 5) of young (planted between 1998 and 2001) and old (planted between 1989 and 1994) TS and DS revegetation, pastures and remnants were compared. Activity on trunks was significantly positively correlated with ant tending of Hemiptera in young and old revegetation. In DS plantings, activity and estimated liquid loads on Eucalyptus trees were low and rapidly approached that in remnants, while TS sites remained similar to high values observed in pastures with trees. Patterns for Acacia were less clear, reflecting consistent densities for this species between TS and DS. At the whole-of-field scale, planting methods did not differ. Importantly, although trajectories differed, neither TS nor DS sites approached the low activity or estimated liquid loads observed in remnants. Rates of ant use of arboreal sugars and associated sugar-fuelled processes may thus take considerably longer to recover than the period covered by this study. This finding suggests planting method may affect the trajectory and outcome of revegetation for plant health, as well as sugar-fuelled ecosystem functions performed by ants.",

Results of a field study in oak-pine woodlands of the Keweenaw Peninsula of N Michigan support such a hypothesis.  Diaspores were set out at grid points on the forest floor & monitored for ant removal.  Nest sites (n=47), which were otherwise undetectable, were located & marked by tracing diaspore-carrying ants to their destination.  Additional diaspores were placed at each nest site & then observed until all (n=20) were taken into the nest.  Ant-planted diaspores of M. lineare exhibited higher germination success, resulting in greater survival to reproduction & fecundity than randomly planted seeds.  Microsites that ants used for diaspore placement had significantly higher light intensities than random microsites.  Considering that published reports cite high light intensity as the primary factor benefiting survival & fecundity in M. lineare, this is one means by which ants confer a selective advantage.  Effect of cover type chosen by ants for seed burial was also studied.  Preferential placement in reindeer lichen microsites (Cladina spp. or Cladonia spp. had 38.3% of ant plantings) was associated with enhanced germination, survival, & fecundity.  Since lichen patches often remain unburned during fire events, the study implies that directed dispersal to these microsites plays the additional role of allowing M. lineare to escape destruction by fire.  Melampyrum lineare has a dispersal distance curve that resembles that of other myrmecochores, but mean (1.08 m) & range (< 4.5 m) distances are even shorter, suggesting that safe sites for this plant are abundantly available.]",

Interactions between widespread invaders call for particular attention because they are likely to be common and because non-additive outcomes of such associations might induce negative consequences (e.g., enhanced population growth increasing impacts or resistance to control). We explored the invasions of two widespread invasive taxa: the Japanese knotweed species complex Fallopia spp. and the invasive garden ant Lasius neglectus, in the urban area of Lyon (France). First, we investigated landscape habitat preferences as well as co-occurrence rates of the two species. We showed that Fallopia spp. and L. neglectus had broadly overlapping environmental preferences (measured by seven landscape variables), but their landscape co-occurrence pattern was random, indicating independent spread and non-obligatory association. Second, as Fallopia spp. produce extra-floral nectar, we estimated the amount of nectar L. neglectus used under field conditions without ant competitors. We estimated that L. neglectus collected 150-321 kg of nectar in the month of April (when nectar production is peaking) in a 1162 m\u2264 knotweed patch, an amount likely to boost ant population growth. Finally, at six patches of Fallopia spp. surveyed, herbivory levels were low (1-6% loss of leaf surface area) but no relationship between ant abundance (native and invasive) and loss of leaf surface was found. Co-occurrences of Fallopia spp. and L. neglectus are likely to become more common as both taxa colonize landscapes, which could favor the spread and invasion success of the invasive ant.",

In eight different natural forests in Venezuela we estimated the species richness and abundance of plants, ants on the soil and on the canopy, the leaf damage of plants and soil nutrients. The main results of the study show that plants with domatia (PD) and plants with extrafloral nectaries (PEFN) have different relationships with ants and suffer from different ecological constraints. PD attract a more specific group of ants than PEFN. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that domatia are adaptations that help plants to increase rare nutrient uptake rather than for herbivore defense. We found that PEFN attract a larger variety of ant species than PD, and ant abundance seems to limit the ecological range of PEFN.

However, little is known about the relative importance of each type of plant defence, especially in the same species. Using the myrmecophyte Triplaris americana (both with and without ants), and the congeneric non-myrmecophyte T. gardneriana, we tested whether ant defence is more effective than other defences of naturally ant-free myrmecophytes and the non-myrmecophyte congeneric species, all spatially co-occurring. In addition, we investigated how plant traits vary among plant groups, and how these traits modulate herbivory. We sampled data on leaf area loss and plant traits from these tree groups in the Brazilian Pantanal floodplain, and found that herbivory is sixfold lower in plants with ants than in ant-free plants, supporting a major role of biotic defences against herbivory. Whereas ant-free plants had more physical defences (sclerophylly and trichomes), they had little effect on herbivory\u0014only sclerophylly modulated herbivory, but with opposite effects depending on ants\u0019 presence and species identity. Despite little variation in the chemicals among plant groups, tannin concentrations and \u00a5\u03c0\u2265C signatures negatively affected herbivory in T. americana plants with ants and in T. gardneriana, respectively. We showed that ant defence in myrmecophytic systems is the most effective against herbivory, as the studied plants could not fully compensate the lack of this biotic defence. We highlight the importance of positive insect-plant interactions in limiting herbivory, and therefore potentially plant fitness.",

In ant-plant mutualisms, benefits provided by plants to ants are immediately recognizable, but reverse benefits are less obvious, conditional and accumulate over longer time spans. Here we tested the hypothesis that the ant Azteca muelleri simultaneously provides multiple benefits to its host plant (Cecropia glaziovii), ultimately increasing plant performance. We planted seedlings and experimentally prevented ant colonization for half of them. Over 4.5 years we quantified the effects of ant presence or absence on plant growth, herbivory levels, fungal infection, fertilization via ant debris and changes in defense strategies. Ant colonization increased plant height by 125% compared to ant-free plants. Such an improvement in plant performance can be explained because plants with ants faced less herbivory, lower prevalence of pathogenic fungi, invested less in foliar trichomes and had more foliar nitrogen. We thus confirmed that ant mutualists provide cumulative benefits including nutritional benefits, effective defense and lower investment into other defenses \u0013 which result in increased plant growth. We highlight the importance of long-term experiments that simultaneously evaluate a multiplicity of potential ant effects to better understand their relative contribution to the performance of the mutualistic partner.",

The observations were made in 2 study plots (invaded or non-invaded by L. humile) of Mediterranean cork-oak secondary forest.  The presence of L. humile implies the displacement of all native ant species that disperse seeds.  Seed transports in the non-invaded zone were carried out by 8 ant species.  In the invaded zone, L. humile workers removed & transported seeds to the nest.  In vertebrate exclusion trials, we observed the same level of seed removal in the invaded & non-invaded zones.  Two findings could explain this result.  Although mean time to seed localization was higher for native ants (431.7 sec) than that for L. humile (150.5 sec), the mean proportion of seeds transported after being detected was higher (50.1%) in non-invaded than in invaded (16.8%) zones.  The proportion of seeds removed & transported into an ant nest after an ant-seed interaction had dramatically reduced from non-invaded (41.9%) to invaded (7.4%) zones.  The levels of seed dispersal by ants found prior to invasion are unlikely to be maintained in invaded zones.  However, total replacement of seed dispersal function is possible if contact iteration finally offers similar levels or quantities of seeds reaching the nests.  The results obtained confirm that the Argentine ant invasion may affect myrmecochory dramatically in the Mediterranean biome.]",

    "abstract": "Cecropia pachystachya is a myrmecophyte which has domatia and nutritional resources used by ants of the genus Azteca. In addition to M\u00b8llerian bodies, another type of structure, food bodies (FBs), are present on the leaves of this plant, which is the focus of this study. Leaf samples were collected and prepared for light, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Histochemical analysis and thin layer chromatography were also employed to determine the composition of reserves. Food bodies are found in young leaves, distributed on the leaf blades and petioles. On leaf blades, FBs occur predominantly on the abaxial surface and are always associated with veins. Food bodies are emergences produced by anticlinal divisions of protodermic cells and divisions of the underlying ground tissue. Mature FBs are claviform, translucent and show fragile stalks. Similar to the epidermal cells, the inner parenchyma cells have thin walls and cytoplasm with few mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum segments; their reserves consist of oil droplets dispersed in the cytoplasmic matrix and reducing sugars in the large central vacuole. Because of the liquid reserves that allow them to be consumed by adult ants, these FBs differ from the well-studied M\u00b8llerian bodies. Food bodies are collected by ants after stipule rupture and immediately consumed. Our results suggest that these FBs act in a complementary function to the M\u00b8llerian bodies, but this hypothesis remains to be tested. Searching for FBs, ants patrol young leaves and this seems to reduce response time to herbivory, thereby reducing leaf damage.",

This result indicates that ants defend more intensely their host plant to avoid damage that diminish food provisioning.  In the non-food providing system, ants responded more quickly to simulation of high foliar damage.

    "abstract": "Plants in some 300 genera produce extrafloral nectar (EFN) to attract ants as a means of indirect defense. Among Mesoamerican Acacia species, obligate myrmecophytes produce EFN constitutively to nourish symbiotic ant mutualists, while non-myrmecophytes induce EFN secretion in response to herbivore damage to attract non-symbiotic ants. Since symbiotic Acacia ants entirely depend on the host-derived food rewards while non-symbiotic ants need to be attracted to EFN, this system allows comparative analyses of the function of EFN components in ant nutrition and attraction. We investigated sugar and amino acid (AA) composition in EFN of two myrmecophytes (Acacia cornigera and Acacia hindsii) and two related non-myrmecophyte species (Acacia farnesiana and Prosopis juliflora). AA composition allowed a grouping of myrmecophytes vs. non-myrmecophytes. Behavioral assays with obligate Acacia inhabitants (Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus) and non-symbiotic ants showed that AA composition affected ant preferences at high but not at low AA/sugar ratios. Most interestingly, behavioral responses differed between the two types of ants tested: Symbiotic ants showed a clear preference for higher AA concentrations and preferred nectar mimics with those four AAs that most significantly characterized the specific nectar of their Acacia host plant. In contrast, non-symbiotic ants distinguished among nectars containing different sugars and between solutions with and without AAs but neither among nectars with different AA/sugar ratios nor among mimics containing different numbers of AAs. Our results confirm that both AAs and sugars contribute to the taste and attractiveness of nectars and demonstrate that the responses of ants to specific nectar components depend on their life style. AAs are a chemical EFN component that likely can shape the structure of ant-plant mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic ants are commonly considered as an efficient indirect defence against herbivores. Nevertheless, their indirect protective role against plant pathogens has been scarcely investigated.  We compared the protective role against pathogens of two different ant partners, a mutualistic and a parasitic ant, on the host plant Acacia hindsii (Fabaceae). The epiphytic bacterial community on leaves was evaluated in the presence and absence of both ant partners by cultivation and by 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.  Pathogen-inflicted leaf damage, epiphytic bacterial abundance (colony-forming units) and number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were significantly higher in plants inhabited by parasitic ants than in plants inhabited by mutualistic ants. Unifrac unweighted and weighted principal component analyses showed that the bacterial community composition on leaves changed significantly when mutualistic ants were removed from plants or when plants were inhabited by parasitic ants. Direct mechanisms provided by ant-associated bacteria would contribute to the protective role against pathogens.  The results suggest that the indirect defence of mutualistic ants also covers the protection from bacterial plant pathogens. Our findings highlight the importance of considering bacterial partners in ant-plant defensive mutualisms, which can contribute significantly to ant-mediated protection from plant pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Nectars are rich in primary metabolites and attract mutualistic animals, which serve as pollinators or as an indirect defense against herbivores. Their chemical composition makes nectars prone to microbial infestation. As protective strategy, floral nectar of ornamental tobacco (Nicotiana langsdorffii X Nicotiana sanderae) contains \"nectarins\", proteins producing reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. By contrast, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were detected in Acacia extrafloral nectar (EFN), which is secreted in the context of defensive ant-plant mutualisms. We investigated whether these PR proteins protect EFN from phytopathogens. Five sympatric species (Acacia cornigera, A. hindsii, A. collinsii, A. farnesiana, and Prosopis juliflora) were compared that differ in their ant-plant mutualism. EFN of myrmecophytes, which are obligate ant-plants that secrete EFN constitutively to nourish specialized ant inhabitants, significantly inhibited the growth of four out of six tested phytopathogenic microorganisms. By contrast, EFN of nonmyrmecophytes, which is secreted only transiently in response to herbivory, did not exhibit a detectable inhibitory activity. Combining two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that PR proteins represented over 90% of all proteins in myrmecophyte EFN. The inhibition of microbial growth was exerted by the protein fraction, but not the small metabolites of this EFN, and disappeared when nectar was heated. In-gel assays demonstrated the activity of acidic and basic chitinases in all EFNs, whereas glucanases were detected only in EFN of myrmecophytes. Our results demonstrate that PR proteins causally underlie the protection of Acacia EFN from microorganisms and that acidic and basic glucanases likely represent the most important prerequisite in this defensive function.",

We recently discovered that PR-proteins such as chitinases, glucanases, peroxidases and thaumatin-like proteins are also functioning in the protection of extrafloral nectar (EFN) of Mexican Acacia myrmecophytes. These plants produce EFN, cellular food bodies and nesting space to house defending ant species of the genus Pseudomyrmex. More than 50 PR-proteins were discovered in this EFN and bioassays demonstrated that they actively can inhibit the growth of fungi and other phytopathogens. Although the plants can, thus, express PR-proteins and secrete them into the nectar, the leaves of these plants exhibit reduced activities of chitinases as compared to non-myrmecophytic plants and their antimicrobial protection depends on the mutualistic ants. When we deprived plants of their resident ants we observed higher microbial loads in the leaves and even in the tissue of the nectaries, as compared to plants that were inhabited by ants. The indirect defense that is achieved through an ant-plant mutualism can protect plants also from infections. Future studies will have to investigate the chemical nature of this mechanism in order to understand why plants depend on ants for their antimicrobial defense.",

The epicuticular wax coverage in both B. chungii and B. multiplex are composed of longitudinally aggregated rodlets. The degree of coiling and dimensions of the aggregates as well as diameter of the terete rodlets, their number in rows, and the number of rows in aggregates differ among the species.

    "abstract": "Although associations between myrmecophytes and their plant ants are recognized as a particularly effective form of protective mutualism, their functioning remains incompletely understood. This field study examined the ant-plant Hirtella physophora and its obligate ant associate Allomerus decemarticulatus. We formulated two hypotheses on the highly specific nature of this association: (1) Ant presence should be correlated with a marked reduction in the amount of herbivory on the plant foliage; (2) ant activity should be consistent with the \"optimal defense\" theory predicting that the most vulnerable and valuable parts of the plant are the best defended. We validated the first hypothesis by demonstrating that for ant-excluded plants, expanding leaves, but also newly matured ones in the long term, suffered significantly more herbivore damage than ant-inhabited plants. We showed that A. decemarticulatus workers represent both constitutive and inducible defenses for their host, by patrolling its foliage and rapidly recruiting nestmates to foliar wounds. On examining how these activities change according to the leaves' developmental stage, we found that the number of patrolling ants dramatically decreased as the leaves matured, while leaf wounds induced ant recruitment regardless of the leaf's age. The resulting level of these indirect defenses was roughly proportional to leaf vulnerability and value during its development, thus validating our second hypothesis predicting optimal protection. This led us to discuss the factors influencing ant activity on the plant's surface. Our study emphasizes the importance of studying both the constitutive and inducible components of indirect defense when evaluating its efficacy and optimality.",

    "abstract": "In the understory of pristine Guianese forests, the myrmecophyte Hirtella physophora almost exclusively shelters colonies of the plant-ant Allomerus decemarticulatus in its leaf pouches. We experimentally tested three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning phenomena that can determine the species specificity of this association throughout the foundation stage of the colonies: (1) interspecific competition results in the overwhelming presence of A. decemarticulatus queens or incipient colonies; (2) exclusion filters prevent other ant species from entering the leaf pouches; and (3) host-recognition influences the choice of founding queens, especially A. decemarticulatus. Neither interspecific competition, nor the purported exclusion filters that we examined play a major role in maintaining the specificity of this association. Unexpectedly, the plant trichomes lining the domatia appear to serve as construction material during claustral foundation rather than as a filter. Finally, A. decemarticulatus queens are able to identify their host plant from a distance through chemical and/or visual cues, which is rarely demonstrated in studies on obligatory ant-plant associations. We discuss the possibility that this specific host-recognition ability could participate in shaping a compartmentalized plant-ant community where direct competition between ant symbionts is limited.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, multipartite mutualisms involving microorganisms such as fungi have been discovered in associations traditionally thought of as bipartite. Ant-plant mutualisms were long thought to be bipartite despite fungi being noticed in an epiphytic ant-plant over 100 years ago. We sequenced fungal DNA from the three distinct domatium chambers of the epiphytic ant-plant Myrmecodia beccarii to establish if fungal communities differ by chamber type across five geographic locations spanning 675 km. The three chamber types serve different ant-associated functions including \u0018waste\u0019 chambers, where ant workers deposit waste; \u0018nursery\u0019 chambers, where the brood is kept; and \u0018ventilation\u0019 chambers, that allow air into the domatium. Overall, fungi from the order Chaetothyriales dominated the chambers in terms of the proportion of operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 13.4%) and sequence abundances of OTUs (28% of the total); however a large portion of OTUs (28%) were unidentified at the order level. Notably, the fungal community in the waste chambers differed consistently from the nursery and ventilation chambers across all five locations. We identified 13 fungal OTUs as \u0018common\u0019 in the waste chambers that were rare or in very low sequence abundance in the other two chambers. Fungal communities in the nursery and ventilation chambers overlapped more than either did with the waste chambers but were also distinct from each other. Differences in dominance of the common OTUs drove the observed patterns in the fungal communities for each of the chamber types. This suggests a multipartite mutualism involving fungi exists in this ant-plant and that the role of fungi differs among chamber types.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is driving changes in plant assemblages worldwide, but animal responses are not well understood, especially in relation to current widespread rates of low-level N deposition. Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) is a foundation species in steppe ecosystems of western North America, where elevated, but low-level N deposition is prevalent. Sagebrush hosts numerous herbivorous and predatory arthropods, some of which form mutualistic (i.e. mutually beneficial) herbivore-predator associations that may be harmful for sagebrush. Here, I evaluated the response of a sagebrush arthropod assemblage to four and nine years of low-level N enrichment in Colorado, USA. Though sagebrush cover and arthropod abundances were not different in the fourth year, by the ninth year, N additions increased arthropod abundances due to greater numbers of sap-feeding insects that are mutualist partners of predaceous ants. Ant and non-mutualist herbivore abundances did not significantly respond to N treatments in the ninth year, but non-mutualist predators were only found in ambient N plots, suggesting ants provided greater anti-predator protection for mutualist herbivores under N enrichment. These responses occurred during drought conditions, which may have increased sagebrush nutritional quality for sap-feeding insects. Sagebrush is experiencing multiple stressors that are transforming steppe ecosystems; these results suggest chronic exposure to common rates of low-level N deposition may create further stress as herbivorous insects proliferate. Additional work is needed to understand and manage the repercussions of N deposition for plant-animal assemblages, particularly in contexts including species of conservation concern and both mutualistic and antagonistic species interactions.",

    "abstract": "Ant richness and abundance are negatively affected by the invasion of alien goldenrods (Solidago sp.). However, little is known about the mechanisms standing behind the impact of the invaders on ant life history, such as colony investments in growth and reproduction. We examined this problem of the investments of Myrmica rubra ant colonies living in different grasslands invaded and non-invaded by goldenrods. Altogether, 47 colonies were analysed; and for each colony, we calculated the number of queens, workers and the production of young workers, gynes, and males. We found that colonies from invaded meadows are smaller in size, but have a similar number of adult queens compared to colonies from non-invaded sites. We also found different brood investments among colonies from invaded and non-invaded meadows\u0014colonies from non-invaded meadows produce more young workers and invest more in growth, whereas colonies from invaded meadows invest more in reproduction through higher gyne production. Male production was at a similar level in colonies from both habitat types. The observed patterns may be explained by the effect of various environmental factors occurring in both grassland types, such as stress in changed habitats, higher competition among gynes in non-invaded grasslands, or finally, by the adaptive colony-level response of ants to stress. The higher production of gynes observed in the invaded grasslands may support dispersal and enhance the probability of establishing a colony in a more favourable location.",

We used sequence data from three chloroplast DNA loci (ccmp5, ccmp6, atpB-rbcL) to assess phylogeographical patterns in species of Macaranga, section Pruinosae, sampled from various regions of Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. Forty-nine chloroplast DNA haplotypes (HT) were identified among 768 specimens from five species, Macaranga gigantea (N\t=\t329; 23 HT), Macaranga pearsonii (N\t=\t347; 21 HT), Macaranga puberula (N\t=\t24; 4 HT), Macaranga hosei (N\t=\t48; 6 HT), and Macaranga pruinosa (N\t=\t20; 5 HT). Forty-one haplotypes were species-specific, whereas eight haplotypes were shared by two, three, or four species and occupied internal positions in a parsimony network. Population genetic parameters based on haplotype frequencies proved to be in a similar range in the non-myrmecophytic M. gigantea and in the ant-associated M. pearsonii, which have overlapping distributions in northern and eastern Borneo. A comparison of G ST and N ST values revealed a strong phylogeographic structure in both species, whereas colonization pathways suggested by the network topology were different. Both species exhibited similar levels of haplotypic diversity and moderate to high levels of population differentiation. There were no obvious indications for an influence of the symbiotic ant partners on the population structure of their host plants.",

We investigated network structure in 4 communities in Mexico.  Nested patterns in ant-plant networks were very similar to those previously reported for pollination and frugivore systems, indicating that this form of asymmetry in specialization is a common feature of mutualisms between free-living species, but not always present in species-poor systems.  Other ecological factors also appeared to contribute to the nested asymmetry in specialization, because some assemblages showed more extreme asymmetry than others even when species-richness was held constant.]",

A new, multigene phylogeny with representatives of all five genera of Cecropieae (most of them from the Neotropics) and half of the 61 species of Cecropia shows the West African endemic Musanga (2 spp.) as sister to Cecropia, implying dispersal from the Neotropics to Africa, with a molecular clock suggesting that this occurred about 23Mya. Cecropia, a genus of neotropical pioneer trees, started diversifying ca. 8Mya. We infer a single origin of specialized symbiosis with Azteca within Cecropia, eight complete losses of this symbiosis, and a potential partner shift involving the replacement of Azteca by Neoponera luteola ants. Niche space modeling based on geo-referenced occurrences of over 9000 collections representing 58 of the 61 species of Cecropia, together with several comparative analyses, implies that mutualism loss is concentrated at high altitudes and on Caribbean islands, with the surprisingly frequent breakdowns potentially facilitated by low species-specificity of interacting Cecropia and Azteca mutualists.",

The amount of resource allocated to food bodies determines the plant-ant colony size and consequently determines the intensity of ant defense (anti-herbivore defense by plant-ants). As constraints in resource allocation change as plants grow, the plant-ant colony size is hypothesized to change with the ontogenesis of Macaranga myrmecophyte. To determine the ontogenetic change in the relative size of the plant-ant colony, we measured the dry weights of the whole plant-ant colony and all of the aboveground parts of trees at various ontogenetic stages for a myrmecophytic species (Macaranga beccariana) in a Bornean lowland tropical rain forest. Ant biomass increased as plant biomass increased. However, the rate of increase gradually declined, and the ant biomass appeared to reach a ceiling once trees began to branch. The ant/plant biomass ratio consistently decreased as plant biomass increased, with the rate of decrease gradually accelerating. We infer that the ontogenetic reduction in ant/plant biomass ratio is caused by an ontogenetic change in resource allocation to food rewards for ants related to the physiological changes accompanying the beginning of branching.",

    "abstract": "1. Although plant invasions often reduce insect abundance and diversity, non\u0010native plants that support phytophagous insects can subsidise higher trophic levels via elevated herbivore abundance. 2. Here ant-aphid interactions on non\u0010native fennel on Santa Cruz Island, California are examined. Fennel hosts abundant, honeydew\u0010producing fennel aphids. The patchiness of fennel and the relative lack of honeydew\u0010producing insects on other plants at our study sites suggest that assimilation of fennel\u0010derived honeydew would increase the abundance and decrease the trophic position of the omnivorous, aphid\u0010tending Argentine ant. 3. To assess the strength of the ant-aphid interaction, a comparison of ant abundance on and adjacent to fennel prior to and 3 weeks after experimental aphid removal was performed. Compared with control plants with aphids, ants declined in abundance on and around fennel plants following aphid removal. At the habitat scale, pitfall traps in fennel\u0010dominated habitats captured more ants than in fennel\u0010free scrub habitats. 4. To determine if assimilation of aphid\u0010produced honeydew reduces the ant's trophic position, variation in \u00a515N values among ants, plants and other arthropods was analysed. Unexpectedly, \u00a515N values for ants in fennel\u0010dominated habitats were higher than those of arthropod predators from the same sites and also higher than those of ants from fennel\u0010free habitats. 5. Our results illustrate how introduced plants that support phytophagous insects appear to transfer energy to higher trophic levels via elevated herbivore abundance. Although assimilation of fennel\u0010derived honeydew did not appear to reduce consumer trophic position, spatial variation in alternative food resources might obscure contributions from honeydew.",

    "abstract": "Mound-forming ants are important ecosystem engineers as they increase habitat heterogeneity, thus supporting multiple biotic interactions. How these ant-mediated changes in abiotic factors translate into temporal biotic heterogeneity, is a less studied subject. In a case study localized on a Danish heath, we investigated how ant mounds (mineral and organic mounds) affected the phenology and flowering success of five plant species growing on or between ant mounds (Lasius flavus and Formica exsecta). Specifically, we focused on the phenophases\u0019 stem elongation, flowering and seed set. All plant species showed significantly earlier phenophases on the mounds compared to control patches between mounds. These advances resulted in two distinct flowering seasons for one plant species and prolonged continuous flowering seasons for the four other species, when mound and non-mound plant seasons were combined. Likewise, stem elongation and seed set seasons were prolonged, with either two distinct seasons or one continuous season, depending on plant species. Two plant species exhibited increased survival up to the flowering stage when growing on ant mounds, since they flowered before a drought killed a large part of the population. Probable drivers behind these effects, as revealed by a structural equation model, were elevated surface temperature and other soil edaphic factors responsible for plant growth. Furthermore, the direct effects of the ant mounds were nearly twice as high for the organic mounds of F. exsecta compared with the mineral mounds of L. flavus. Possible implications are more resilient ecosystems, as prolonged seasons can mitigate phenological mismatches between interacting species.",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant mutualisms are conspicuous and ecologically important components of tropical ecosystems that remain largely unexplored in terms of insect-associated microbial communities. Recent work has revealed that ants in some ant-plant systems cultivate fungi (Chaetothyriales) within their domatia, which are fed to larvae. Using Pseudomyrmex penetrator/Tachigali sp. from French Guiana and Petalomyrmex phylax/Leonardoxa africana and Crematogaster margaritae/Keetia hispida, both from Cameroon, as models, we tested the hypothesis that ant-plant-fungus mutualisms co-occur with culturable Actinobacteria. Using selective media, we isolated 861 putative Actinobacteria from the three systems. All C. margaritae/K. hispida samples had culturable Actinobacteria with a mean of 10.0 colony forming units (CFUs) per sample, while 26 % of P. penetrator/Tachigali samples (mean CFUs 1.3) and 67 % of P. phylax/L. africana samples (mean CFUs 3.6) yielded Actinobacteria. The largest number of CFUs was obtained from P. penetrator workers, P. phylax alates, and C. margaritae pupae. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of four main clades of Streptomyces and one clade of Nocardioides within these three ant-plant mutualisms. Streptomyces with antifungal properties were isolated from all three systems, suggesting that they could serve as protective symbionts, as found in other insects. In addition, a number of isolates from a clade of Streptomyces associated with P. phylax/L. africana and C. margaritae/K. hispida were capable of degrading cellulose, suggesting that Streptomyces in these systems may serve a nutritional role. Repeated isolation of particular clades of Actinobacteria from two geographically distant locations supports these isolates as residents in ant-plant-fungi niches.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions are embedded in networks of interactions that affect the benefits accruing to the mutualistic partners. Figs and their pollinating wasps are engaged in an obligate mutualism in which the fig is dependent on the fig pollinator for pollination services and the pollinator is dependent on fig ovules for brood sites. This mutualism is exploited by non-pollinating fig wasps that utilise the same ovules, but do not provide a pollination service. Most non-pollinating wasps oviposit from outside the inflorescence (syconium), where they are vulnerable to ant predation. Ficus schwarzii is exposed to high densities of non-pollinating wasps, but Philidris sp. ants patrolling the syconia prevent them from ovipositing. Philidris rarely catch wasps, but the fig encourages the patrolling by providing a reward through extra-floral nectaries on the surface of syconia. Moreover, the reward is apparently only produced during the phase when parasitoids are ovipositing. An ant-exclusion experiment demonstrated that, in the absence of ants, syconia were heavily attacked and many aborted as a consequence. Philidris was normally rare on the figs during the receptive phase or at the time of day when wasp offspring are emerging, so predation on pollinators was limited. However, Myrmicaria sp. ants, which only occurred on three trees, preyed substantially on pollinating as well as non-pollinating wasps. F. schwarzii occurs in small clusters of trees and has an exceptionally rapid crop turnover. These factors appear to promote high densities of non-pollinating wasps and, as a consequence, may have led to both a high incidence of ants on trees and increased selective pressure on fig traits that increase the payoffs of the fig-ant interaction for the fig. The fig receives no direct benefit from the reward it provides, but protects pollinating wasps that will disperse its pollen.",

    "abstract": "The prevalent way aphids accomplish colony defense against natural enemies is a mutualistic relationship with ants or the occurrence of a specialised soldier caste typcial for eusocial aphids, or even both. Despite a group-living life style of those aphid species lacking these defense lines, communal defense against natural predators has not yet been observed there. Individuals of Aphis nerii (Oleander aphid) and Uroleucon hypochoeridis, an aphid species feeding on Hypochoeris radicata (hairy cat's ear), show a behavioral response to visual stimulation in the form of spinning or twitching, which is often accompanied by coordinated kicks executed with hind legs. Interestingly, this behaviour is highly synchronized among members of a colony and repetitive visual stimulation caused strong habituation. Observations of natural aphid colonies revealed that a collective twitching and kicking response (CTKR) was frequently evoked during oviposition attempts of the parasitoid wasp Aphidius colemani and during attacks of aphidophagous larvae. CTKR effectively interrupted oviposition attempts of this parasitoid wasp and even repelled this parasitoid from colonies after evoking consecutive CTKRs. In contrast, solitary feeding A. nerii individuals were not able to successfully repel this parasitoid wasp. In addition, CTKR was also evoked through gentle substrate vibrations. Laser vibrometry of the substrate revealed twitching-associated vibrations that form a train of sharp acceleration peaks in the course of a CTKR. This suggests that visual signals in combination with twitching-related substrate vibrations may play an important role in synchronising defense among members of a colony. In both aphid species collective defense in encounters with different natural enemies was executed in a stereotypical way and was similar to CTKR evoked through visual stimulation. This cooperative defense behavior provides an example of a surprising sociality that can be found in some aphid species that are not expected to be social at all.          *[Ants were never seen on Oleander, in contrast to Hypochoeris radicata, where ants belonging to different species regularly evoked brief solitary defense reactions after contact with U. hypochoeridis individuals.]",

    "abstract": "Across the globe, biological invasions have disrupted mutualisms, producing reverberating consequences for ecosystems. Although invasive species frequently trigger mutualism disruptions, few studies have quantified the demographic mechanisms by which mutualism breakdown may generate population effects. In a Kenyan savanna, the invasive big\u0010headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) has disrupted a foundational mutualism between the monodominant whistling\u0010thorn tree (Acacia drepanolobium) and native ants (Crematogaster spp.) that deter browsing by large mammalian herbivores. We conducted experiments to quantify the demographic consequences of this mutualism disruption in the presence and absence of large mammalian herbivores. Invasion by P. megacephala exacerbated population declines of A. drepanolobium, primarily through decreased survival and reproduction of adult trees. However, these fitness reductions were small compared to those resulting from the presence of large mammalian herbivores, which negatively impacted growth and survival. Contrary to expectation, the expulsion of metabolically costly Crematogaster mutualists by P. megacephala did not result in higher population growth rates for trees protected from large mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that invasive P. megacephala may impose a direct metabolic cost to trees exceeding that of native mutualists while providing no protection from browsing by large mammalian herbivores. Across landscapes, we expect that invasion by P. megacephala will reduce A. drepanolobium populations, but that the magnitude and demographic pathways of this effect will hinge on the presence and abundance of browsers.",

    "abstract": "Many plants interact with carnivores as an indirect defense against herbivores. The release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the secretion of extrafloral nectar (EFN) are induced by insect feeding, a response that is mediated by the plant hormone, jasmonic acid. Although VOCs mainly attract predatory mites and parasitic wasps, while EFN mainly attracts ants, many more animal-plant interactions are influenced by these two traits. Other traits involved in defensive tritrophic interactions are cellular food bodies and domatia, which serve the nutrition and housing of predators. They are not known to respond to herbivory, while food body production can be induced by the presence of the mutualists. Interactions among the different defensive traits, and between them and other biotic and abiotic factors exist on the genetic, physiological, and ecological levels, but so far remain understudied. Indirect defenses are increasingly being discussed as an environmentally-friendly crop protection strategy, but much more knowledge on their fitness effects under certain environmental conditions is required before we can understand their ecological and evolutionary relevance, and before tritrophic interactions can serve as a reliable tool in agronomy.",

We tested the hypothesis that Acacia hosts manipulate this digestive specialization of their ant mutualists. Invertase (sucrose hydrolytic) activity in the ant midguts was inhibited by chitinase, a dominant EFN protein. The inhibition occurred quickly in cell-free gut liquids and in native gels and thus likely results from an enzyme-enzyme interaction. Once a freshly eclosed worker ingests EFN as the first diet available, her invertase becomes inhibited and she, thus, continues feeding on host-derived EFN.

We tested this hypothesis by spectrophotometrically quantifying 3 classes of phenolic compounds, hydrolysable tannins, flavonoids, & condensed tannins, in the foliage of 20 ant-plant & non-ant-plant species of the unrelated genera Leonardoxa, Macaranga, & Acacia, & other closely related Mimosoideae from Leucaena, Mimosa, & Prosopis.  We further determined biological activities of leaf extracts of the mimosoid species against fungal spore germination (as measure of pathogen resistance), seed germination (as measure of allelopathic activity), & caterpillar growth (as measure of anti-herbivore defence).  Condensed tannin content in 3 of 4 populations of the non-myrmecophytic Leonardoxa was significantly higher than in populations of the myrmecophyte.  In contrast, we observed no consistent differences between ant-plants & non-ant-plants in the Mimosoideae & in the genus Macaranga, though contents of phenolic compounds varied strongly among different species in each of these 2 plant groups.  Similarly, among the investigated Mimosoideae, biological activity against spore or seed germination & caterpillar growth varied considerably, but showed no clear relation with the existence of an obligate mutualism with ants.  Our results did not support the hypothesis of 'trade-offs' between indirect, biotic, & direct, chemical defence in ant-plants.  A critical re-evaluation of the published data suggests that support for this hypothesis is more tenuous than is usually believed.  The general and well-established phenomenon, that myrmecophytes are subject to severe attack by herbivores when deprived of their ants, still lacks an explanation.]",

Because cost-effective defense of the host by ants increases ant fitness, selection should act on ant behavior to produce patterns of distribution of defense as predicted for direct chemical defence traits.  Termites & pieces of tape were equally distributed over the uppermost 10-leaves & over the leaf-bearing part of the stems (with termites mimicking a transient herbivore, while tape mimics a long-term stress caused by a climber or plant parasite).  This arrangement allowed a separation of putative coevolutionary adaptations in the ants' behavior from other potential sources of spatial patterns in ant defense, such as differences in herbivore pressure, in the vulnerability of different herbivores, or in direct plant defences.

    "abstract": "Ant-plant interactions represent a diversity of strategies, from exploitative to mutualistic, and how these strategies evolve is poorly understood. Here, we link physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the Acacia-Pseudomyrmex system. Host plant species represented 2 different strategies. High-reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar (EFN), food bodies, and nesting space than low-reward hosts, even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist. High-reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by non-defending ants than low-reward hosts. At the phenotypic level, secretion of EFN and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion, whereas a non-defending exploiter did not. All of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high-reward hosts with defending ant species. However, exploiter ants are less dependent on the host-derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low-reward hosts. Mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low-reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor. We conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment-payoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can, thus, increase the diversity within the taxa involved.",

Such priming effects are well known for induced resistance to pathogens, yet this is the first description of VOCs priming EFN secretion, a taxonomically widespread anti-herbivore defence.

    "abstract": "Protective ant-plant interactions provide valuable model systems to study mutualisms. Here, we summarize our recent research on chemical and physiological adaptations that contribute to the stabilization of the mutualism between Mesoamerican Acacia host plants and their Pseudomyrmex ant inhabitants against exploiters, that is, species using host-derived rewards without rendering a service. Acacia hosts produce food bodies (FBs) and extrafloral nectar (EFN). Both types of reward are chemically adapted to their specific function as ant food and protected from different exploiters. FBs contained higher amounts of specific proteins than the leaves from which they originate. EFN possessed amino acids making it attractive for the mutualist ants and an invertase making its carbohydrate composition nutritionally suitable for the mutualists but unattractive for generalists. Moreover, pathogenesis-related proteins such as glucanases, chitinases and peroxidases were found in EFN, which likely serve as protection from microorganisms. Digestive adaptations were found that make workers of the ant mutualists dependent on the host-derived food sources, a mechanism that likely counteracts the evolution of cheaters. The ants also possessed a high diversity of bacterial associates, several of which appeared involved in nitrogen fixation, thus contributing to the nutrition of these 'vegetarian' ants. By contrast, a non-defending ant species that parasitizes the host plants appeared physiologically less adapted to the host-derived food rewards; this species, thus, likely is competitively inferior when colony growth is limited by plant-derived rewards. In summary, several physiological adaptations of both host plants and ants stabilize the Acacia-Pseudomyrmex mutualism against exploitation.",

However, plant distributions in the field after another 4 years were clearly deviating from model predictions.  Mean annual spread rate increased from 0.9 to 5.1-m per year, with a clear inhomogeneous component.  After a lag-phase of several years, non-random seed dispersal by large red wood ants, Formica rufa, was determining the species' spread, thus resulting in stratified dispersal due to interactions with different-sized ant species.  Hypotheses on stratified dispersal, on dispersal lag, & on non-random dispersal were verified using an extended spatially explicit individual-based model, by comparison of model outputs with field patterns (individual numbers, population areas, maximum distances).  Dispersal towards red wood ant nests together with seed loss during transport & redistribution around nests were essential features of the model extension.

The two-specie model is expanded to examine the effects of a predator or competitor because, in nature, myrmecochorous herbs often suffer heavy seed predation from small rodents or compete with non myrmecochores. Low to moderate levels of predation stabilize mutualism that is unstable in isolation. Numerical simulations indicate that the locally stable equilibrium point 'attracts' reasonable initial population sizes of the three species. Competition betwee the myrmecochore and a nonmyrmecochore decreases the probability of a stable coexistence compared to the isolated mutualism. It is suggested that many mutualisms are stabilized, and not merely bounded by a third species. Predation is the most likely stabilizing interaction.",

Visitation rates to the baits were higher in the more disturbed sites.  There was little evidence for depressed ant diversity in disturbed habitats, though ant community composition varied.  Seed dispersal distances were likely to be depressed only in agroecosystems, due to the smaller average size of ants, but even this difference is moderated by the tendency for myrmecochores in disturbed sites to have small seeds relative to plants in forest habitats.  Where sites have extensive tree canopies, the ant communities & dispersal rates are likely to be very resistant to change.

    "abstract": "Ants are a major source of soil disturbance and can influence vegetation dynamics and biodiversity by changing environmental conditions. Their seed collection activity supports dispersal and can favour the presence of species, including introduced, non-native and invasive species. Understanding of seed dispersal mechanisms is important for predicting plant distributions and invasive risk. Studies generally addressing myrmecochory have mostly focused on interactions between native species and few have considered the role of ants in spreading non-native plants. This study investigated effects of a native species Formica rufa (red wood ant) on the distribution of the invasive plant, Impatiens parviflora DC (small balsam). The study measured ant seed collection activity and plant and soil chemical characteristics to evaluate whether assumptions of the directed dispersal hypothesis obtained. Seed collection experiments showed that ants do not selectively collect small balsam seeds but collect them randomly at about the same rates as other organic and inorganic material. Non-targeted collection however suffices in dispersing small balsam seeds in or near the ant nest thus enhancing plant establishment, growth and reproduction. I. parviflora density in the forest floor was 3.06 plants per m\u2264 while I. parviflora density reached 82.68 plants per m\u2264 in and around ant nests I. parviflora individuals growing on nest mounds were significantly larger, showed more flowers and produced more seeds than plants established on the surrounding forest floor. Better growth of I. parviflora on and around ant nests corresponded with significantly higher nutrient content, especially of nitrates and available phosphorus in ant nests. Ant nests also showed higher pH values and available potassium, sodium and calcium. This study thus found that red wood ants contribute to the expansion of I. parviflora by soil transformation and non-targeted seed dispersal in an otherwise nutrient-poor environment where the plant would otherwise struggle to flourish.",

    "abstract": "1. Nearly all mutualisms entail the production of resources by one species that attract and reward the species with which it interacts. As such resource production could otherwise be allocated to growth or reproduction, mutualists are predicted to minimize these investment costs. Here, we employ optimal defence theory for plant secondary compounds to evaluate plant production of extrafloral nectar (EFN) resources to attract and reward ants for resistance against herbivores. 2. Through ant exclusion and artificial herbivory experiments, we examined investment in EFN by both buds and fruits of Pachycereus schottii (senita cacti) in the Sonoran Desert of North America. We tested predictions of optimal defence theory that plants invest more in high value parts (fruits) through constitutive EFN, less in low value parts (buds) through induced EFN, and that for a given plant part (buds or fruits), constitutive and induced EFN are negatively correlated. 3. Constitutive levels of EFN were greater in fruits than in buds. Only buds showed induced EFN production following artificial herbivory. Constitutive EFN scaled positively with fruit size but not bud size. Induced EFN was negatively correlated with constitutive EFN for fruits (but not buds), suggesting a potential trade-off in these two herbivore resistance traits. 4. These results indicate that P. schottii minimizes its costs by investing in induced EFN for buds and constitutive EFN for fruits. Moreover, by shifting from induced to constitutive EFN with the morphogenesis of buds to fruits, our results show that investment in EFN can change as a particular plant tissue increases from a lower to a higher value. 5. Synthesis. Indirect defence through EFN production is in accord with that of direct defence through plant secondary compounds, thereby supporting optimal defence theory as a general framework with which to evaluate the costs of producing resources (i.e. the defence) by plants, lycaenids and homopterans to attract and reward ants for their resistance against natural enemies in protection mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "*[Evaluation of the potential for soil movement due to the activities of living organisms has been a key focus in recent Performance Assessments for the containment of radioactive waste buried in deep alluvial soils at the Nevada Test Site (NTS).  We have attempted here to conduct a thorough literature review in order to provide information fundamental to biological assumptions of probabilistic pedoturbation models that are put forth conceptually herein.  We have also provided a conceptual framework & background on the ecology of the region that sets the stage for our investigations.  We have identified plants & animals of the NTS that potentially move & mix soils in the top 5 meters via processes of rooting, growth, colonization, & burrowing.  Animals include numerous mammal, ant, & termite species.  Ants appear to have stronger ties to desert biomes (Great Basin Desert, Mojave Desert) than mammals, & may be more restricted in habitat by plant associations, although information regarding species-specific, ant-plant foraging requirements, & preferences was not forthcoming from literature.  Close associations of ants with particular plant species may be more important for certain species, such as wood ants (Crematogaster spp.) than generalists (e.g., Forelius pruinosus), or seed harvesters (e.g., Pogonomyrmex spp., Messor pergandei), & honeydew gatherers (Myrmecocystus spp.).   Indeed, many of the latter species (Pogonomyrmex spp., M. pergandei, Myrmecocystus spp.) appear to prefer interspaces of plants, rather than to nest in direct association with plants, & may benefit from generalist forage habits without ties to specific plant species or trophobionts.  Ants are the record-holders among desert animals when considering the maximum depth of nests of deeply-burrowing species.  The deepest burrowing species of ants that occupy valley environments at the NTS are Pogonomyrmex rugosus, P. occidentalis, P. salinus, Messor pergandei, & Myrmecocystus mexicanus.  It is possible that other deeply burrowing Myrmecocystus ant species may occupy valley environments in the Great Basin Desert biome.  In the course of excavating & maintaining a nest in the colony's lifetime, these species of ants may excavate significant quantities of soil from depths between the ground surface & 4.5 meters.   There is little question that ants, that burrow deeply, pose the potential to move soils from the deepest portions of their nests to the ground surface, & may do so repeatedly in the maintenance & expansion of nests.  By means of these processes & the establishment of new nests over time, ants play key ecological roles in the deep mixing of desert soils over expansive areas through time.  The roles of ants as deep burrowers pose, perhaps, the most significant challenge to managers of waste storage facilities with regard to the long-term consequence of biotic transport of soil-born contaminants.  The maximum depths & the volumetric extent of excavations that each of the identified deep burrowing ant species may create are measures that require significant further investigation, particularly for concerns of the NTS facilities.  The summary of literature sources from areas outside the NTS provides reasonable estimation of the maximum depth parameter for several (but not all) of these species, however volumetric information with depth is greatly lacking.]",

We address these hypotheses in the Crematogaster ant-Macaranga plant system, in which plants provide living space & food, while ants protect plants from herbivory.  We observed food acceptance & rejection behavior across 5 ant species & 3 plant host species.  Ants were offered 3 types of food: termites as a surrogate herbivore, symbiotic scale insects, & nutritious food bodies produced by different host plant species.  The unique ant species living in M. winkleri was the most likely to reject food items not provided by the plant species, followed by ants in M. glandibracteolata, while ants in M. pearsonii accepted most items offered to them.  Using stable isotopes, chemical cues, & proteomic analyses, we demonstrate that this behavior was not related to differences between plant species in nutritional quality or composition of food bodies.  Isotopic signatures revealed that certain species are primary consumers, but other ant species can be secondary consumers even where surrogate herbivores are rejected, although these values varied depending on the ant developmental stage & plant species.  Macaranga pearsonii & M. glandibracteolata, the 2 most closely related plant species, had most similar surface chemical cues of food bodies.  However, M. glandibracteolata had strongest differences in food body nutritional content, isotopic signatures, & protein composition from either of the other 2 plant species studied.

    "abstract": "1. Ant-plant mutualisms are among the most widespread and ecologically important insect-plant interactions in the tropics. The multitrophic mutualism involving Macaranga plants (Euphorbiaceae) and Crematogaster ants (Formicidae) is the most diverse in Southeast Asia. This interaction also includes trophobiotic scale insects (Coccidae) and nematodes inhabiting ant refuse piles. 2. Here two myrmecophytic systems were compared, Macaranga trachyphylla with Crematogaster captiosa (Mt + Cc) and Macaranga beccariana with Crematogaster decamera (Mb + Cd), using a fine\u0010scale dissection of the stems. For the two plant species, for each internode, both contents (ants, coccids, refuse piles) and structure (internode height, numbers of open and occluded ant holes) were recorded. 3. There were significant patterns in the vertical distribution of ant colonies and their symbionts in the plant stems. Most coccids were kept in the highest sections of both systems, although Mb + Cd hosted a broader range of coccid species than Mt + Cc. Three nematode species were recorded, but with a rather low specificity to plant or ant species. Furthermore, the fine\u0010scale distribution showed aggregation of closed holes with ant brood and separation of nematode\u0010infested refuse piles from eggs. 4. The results of this study indicate that ants manipulate spatial colony structure via distribution of brood, holes and the symbionts.

The ants nest in cavities formed in the tubers derived from the hypocotyl (in the Rubiaceae); in the leaves (Dischidia); in the rhizome (the ferns); or in the leaf-bases (Tillandsia). 3. The plants gain nutrients via the ants as indicated by the following: a) Possibly absorptive sites occupy localized areas within the hollow structures. b) The ants keep their brood in the non-absorptive areas and deposit organic-remains in the absorptive areas.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The relationships formed by ants with plants are quite distinct from those typically developed by other animal groups. While other animals may consume plants, pollinate them or disperse them, ants are surprisingly infrequent in these roles. Yet when mutualistic relationships other than pollination and dispersal are looked at, it is repeatedly ants which are found and almost never other animals. The nature of these relationships will be described in this chapter along with a discussion of aspects of the biology of ants which may have facilitated the evolution of so many mutualisms.     *[e.g.: hollow stem domatia which are regularly inhabited by ants: fig. of Clerodendron, Vitex, Duroia, Cordia, Humboldtia.]",

    "abstract": "Animal-pollinated plants can be susceptible to changes in pollinator availability. Honeydew-producing treehoppers frequently occur on inflorescences, potentially enhancing ant-mediated negative effects on pollination services. However, the effect of ant-attended, honeydew-producing insects on plant reproduction remains uncertain. We recorded the abundance of treehoppers and ants on Byrsonima intermedia (Malpighiaceae), and monitored floral visitors in a Brazilian cerrado savanna. We manipulated the presence of ants and ant-treehopper associations on inflorescences to assess their effect on pollination and fruit formation. We used dried ants pinned to inflorescences to evaluate the effect of ant presence and ant identity on potential pollinators. Results show that the presence of treehoppers increases ant abundance on flowers and disrupts pollination by oil-collecting bees, decreasing the frequency and duration of floral visits and reducing fruit and seed set. Treehopper herbivory has no direct effect on fruit or seed production, which are independent of treehopper density. Pinned ants promote avoidance by floral visitors, reducing the number of visits. Ant identity mediates visitation decisions, with Ectatomma brunneum causing greater avoidance by floral visitors than Camponotus rufipes. Field videos show that pollinating bees are harassed by ants near flowers, prompting avoidance behavior by the bees. This is the first demonstration of indirect effects by honeydew-gathering ants, via disrupted pollination, on plant reproduction in tropical cerrado savanna. Our results highlight the importance of studying other interactions near flowers, in addition to just observing pollinators, for a proper understanding of plant reproduction.",

Although many authors consider ants as mere nectar robbers, there are studies proving that ants may act as pollinators and that some plants even have flower traits acting as ant attractors. In this study, we evaluated the role of the ants in pollination of Blutaparon portulacoides inflorescences. This plant species has most of the traits favorable for ant pollination, such as short and aggregated inflorescences, and synchronized blooming as well as growing in an environment where ant pollination is likely to occur. Our results show that ants are the most abundant visitors throughout the day and that there is no effect of ant integument on pollen germination. Furthermore, the flower visitor exclusion experiment showed that ants have a role in the pollination of B. portulacoides by promoting seed formation. Ants can have an important part in the pollination of B. portulacoides in a scenario where winged insects are absent or scarce.          *[B. termitophilus, D, nigra, & P. reichenspergeri workers observed with pollen grains adhering to their bodies.]",

    "abstract": "Cospeciation, in which both parties of an ecological interaction speciate in parallel with each other, has rarely been reported in biotic associations except the cases for host-parasite interaction. Many tropical plants house ants and thereby gain protection against herbivores. Although these ant-plant symbioses have been regarded as classical cases of coevolved mutualism, no evidence of cospeciation has been documented. The Asian ant-plant association between Crematogaster ants and Macaranga plants is highly species specific and the molecular phylogeny of the ants parallels the plant phylogeny, reflecting history of cospeciation. Evidence is presented that this association has been maintained over the past seven million years. Phylogeographic patterns of 27 ants from two Macaranga species suggest that allopatric cospeciations are still in progress in Asian wet tropics.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined whether or not coexisting congeneric plant species have different defense strategies against herbivores, and the intensity of defense changes ontogenetically. We focused on nine myrmecophytic Macaranga species and estimated the intensity of non-biotic and biotic defense by the degree of leaf damage in ant-free and ant-occupied plants, respectively. Ant colonization of myrmecophytic Macaranga species occurred in the early stage of plant development (5-50 cm-tall seedlings). Following the colonization, damage by leaf eaters was minimized and stable during the ontogenetic development of the host plants due to protection by ants. In ant-free trees, however, herbivore damage was immense in seedlings and decreased as trees grew. Interspecific comparison of leaf damage and herbivore fauna supported that coexisting congeneric plants differ in their types of non-biotic (chemical/structural) defense: without ant protection, Macaranga beccariana, for example, was somewhat resistant to leaf eaters but susceptible to gall-makers, Macaranga trachyphylla was heavily infested by generalist leaf eaters, and Macaranga winkleri was exploited by ant-predatory birds. Despite these variations in chemical/structural defense, ant-colonized plants were generally well defended by ants against all kinds of herbivores. This suggests that the individual host-specific ant mutualists are well adapted to deter the chemically or structurally adapted herbivores. These results imply that in the history of diversification in the Macaranga-ant-herbivore system, a sequence of mutual counter adaptation took place not only between plants and herbivores but also between ants and herbivores.",

    "abstract": "Myrmecophytes (ant-plants) have special hollow structures (domatia) in which obligate ant partners nest. As the ants live only on the plants and feed exclusively on plant food bodies, sap-sucking homopterans in the domatia, and/or the homopteran's honeydew, they are suitable for the study of colony size regulation by food. We examined factors regulating ant colony size in four myrmecophytic Macaranga species, which have strictly species-specific association with Crematogaster symbiont ants. Intra- and interspecific comparison of the plants showed that the ant biomass per unit food biomass was constant irrespective of plant developmental stage and plant species, suggesting that the ant colony size is limited by food supply. The primary food offered by the plants to the ants was different among Macaranga species. Ants in Macaranga beccariana and Macaranga bancana relied on homopterans rather than food bodies, and appeared to regulate the homopteran biomass and, as a consequence, regulate the ants' own biomass. In contrast, ants in Macaranga winkleri and Macaranga trachyphylla relied primarily on food bodies rather than homopterans, and the plants appeared to manipulate the ant colony size. Per capita plant investment in ants (ant dry weight plant dry weight-1) was different among the four Macaranga species. The homoptera-dependent M. beccariana and M. bancana harbored lower biomass of ants than the food-body dependent M. winkleri, suggesting that energy loss is involved in the homoptera-interposing symbiotic system which has one additional trophic level. The plants' investment ratio to the ants generally decreased as plants grew. The evolution of the plant reward-offering system in ant-plant-homopteran symbioses is discussed with an emphasis on the role of homopterans.",

    "abstract": "We studied the relationship between Hirtella myrmecophila (Chrysobalanaceae), a common but little-studied Amazonian ant-plant that produces leaf-pouches as domatia, and its obligate ant partner, Allomerus octoarticulatus. Field observations revealed that H. myrmecophila drops domatia from older leaves, a characteristic that is unique among myrmecophytes. The physiological mechanism for abortion of domatia is currently unknown, but this characteristic allows for the existence, within the same plant, of branches with and without ants. Older branches generally bear only old leaves with no domatia and therefore have no ants, whereas younger branches have leaves of various ages. Ants forage mainly on new leaves, and experimental removal of ants showed that A. octoarticulatus is crucial for defense of these leaves against insect herbivores. However, A. octoarticulatus also acts as a castration parasite, severing the plant\u0019s inflorescences. Mature flowers and fruits were only found on older branches with no ants, and flower production was 8 times greater on plants whose ants were experimentally removed than on control plants. Given the reproductive costs inflicted by its mutualistic partner, we suggest that abortion of domatia is a strategy developed by H. myrmecophila to minimize the effects of cheating by A. octoarticulatus. These results support the view that evolutionary conflicts of interest between mutualistic species often impose selection for cheating on the partner, as well as for mechanisms to retaliate or to prevent super-exploitation. Opposing selection pressures, operating independently on the two partners, probably help to maintain the evolutionary stability of this mutualistic relationship.",

In Vismia forests the myrmecophyte composition was strongly associated with the number of recent fire events, while in Cecropia it was related to the age since cutting.  There was a strong relationship between the myrmecophyte composition & their ant-associated community within each of the 3 kinds of forests.  The proportion of uncolonized plants & the proportion of plants hosting non-specific ants were larger in Vismia forest than in Cecropia or mature forests.  The colonization of the myrmecophyte Maieta guianensis, in secondary forests, was limited by the distance to a young queen source (in this case, the mature forest).  In both Vismia & Cecropia forests, I found a decrease in the number of colonization events & in the proportion of plants colonized by M. guianensis' specific partner ant (Pheidole minutula) with increasing distance to the forest.  After successfully colonizing a plant in any kind of secondary forest, P. minutula presented normal development, producing workers & alates.  Successful colonization & development of the colony in secondary forests were also observed in the Cordia nodosa-Azteca sp.2 plant-ant system, but not in the other common association in Central Amazonia, Hirtella myrmecophila -Allomerus octoarticulatus.  In both M. guianensis & C. nodosa, the resident ants tend coccids in the domatia.  This was not observed in A. octoarticulatus colonies which have fewer ants per domatia within a plant in secondary forests.  Consequently, herbivory of H. myrmecophila was higher in these environments.  Herbivory rates were indistinguishable between the 2 kinds of secondary forest, for any of the 3 plant species.  In the Azteca sp2-C. nodosa system, the predation of ants by Cebus appela monkeys was higher in secondary than in mature forests.  This predation occurred almost exclusively in the western part of the study area, which falls on its own hydrografic basin, also presented the largest C. nodosa density.  In a preliminary analysis, however, ant predation doesn't seem to have a relevant impact on plant or ant-plant populations.]",

We did not observe differences on recruitment between galled & ungalled leaves.  However, gall tissue extracts did not induce ant recruitment on H. myrmecophila, while galled leaves extracts resulted in a stimulus to ant recruitment.  These results indicate that insect gall tissues on this myrmecophyte probably do not possess compounds which can be detected by the ants.

To investigate the influence of plant size and the presence of resident ants on the arthropod community associated with the ant-plant Hirtella myrmecophila, ants (Allomerus octoarticulatus) were experimentally removed from plants of various sizes, with a second group of similar-sized plants remaining as controls. The abundance and diversity of arthropods on these plants were determined at 45-day intervals for 7 months. Collected arthropods were assigned into one of three predetermined groups: herbivores, spiders (mostly web-building spiders), or 'tourists' (mostly non-resident ants, hemipterans, dipterans, or scarabeid beetles). 2. Ant removal had a positive influence on the abundance and diversity of herbivores, but no measurable effects on the abundance and diversity of 'tourists', while the effect on spider abundance was significant only when data from Dipoena sp. nov. were removed from the analysis. While A. octoarticulatus had a negative effect on most spiders, it favoured Dipoena sp. nov., which was found to be a specialist predator of A. octoarticulatus. 3. Plant size positively affected the abundance and diversity of 'tourists' in plants with and without ants, but for herbivores and spiders this effect was dependent on ant treatment. In ant-maintained plants the per-plant abundance of herbivores and spiders was independent of plant size, whereas in ant-removed plants it was not. 4. These results suggest that A. octoarticulatus affects all arthropods found on its host plant, except those presenting an occasional and temporary association with the plant, and that the magnitude of ant effects on the susceptible guilds increases as plant size increases.",

    "abstract": "1. Mutualisms are ubiquitous and ecologically important, but may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation by species outside of the mutualism owing to a combination of an attractive reward and potentially limited defence options. For some mutualisms, ants can offer dynamic and relatively selective protection against herbivores and parasites. 2. The mutualism between fig trees and their pollinating wasps, a keystone mutualism in tropical forests, is particularly well suited for ant protection because pollinators are protected inside hollow inflorescences but parasites are exposed on the outside. 3. In the present study, it was shown that the presence of ants provides a fitness benefit for both the pollinators and the hosting fig tree. The presence of ants (i) reduced abortions of developing figs, (ii) reduced herbivory of figs, and (iii) reduced parasitic wasp loads, resulting in more pollinators and more seeds in ant-protected figs. Even when taking costs such as ant predation on emerging pollinators into account, the total fitness increase of hosting ants was threefold for the tree and fivefold for the pollinators. 4. It was further shown that the seemingly most vulnerable parasitic wasps, of the genus Idarnes, have a specific behaviour that allows them to evade ant attack while continuing to oviposit. 5. Ants were present on 79% of surveyed Panamanian fig trees. Together with previous studies from the Old World, the results found here imply that ants are both powerful and common protectors of the fig mutualism worldwide.          *[Camponotus (Myrmobrachys) misspelled Camponotus (Myrmobrachus).]",

This system is, in both process and pattern, extremely similar to that of the swollen-thorn acacias and their ant occupants.

It appears that C. peltata survives without its ants on Caribbean islands because of the reduced herbivore challenge in insular habitats, and reduced interspecific competition from trees in those island habitats that are poor in vines. On the mainland, some high-elevation Cecropia have also lost the mutualistic interaction with Azteca. One lowland mainland species, C. sciadophylla, lacks a mutualistic interaction with ants, and may represent an invasion of the lowlands by a Cecropia species that earlier lost its ant interaction on an island or at mainland high elevations.

The ants place large quantities of insect parts in the plants, which probably take up their decomposition products. Virtually all epiphytes in this community are trophically associated with a colony of I. myrmecodiae and one or more myrmecophytes, and it appears that there are not enough nutrients to support epiphytes unless they obtain extra nutrients from ants. Two conspicuous plant parasites, Dischidia gaudichaudii and Pachycentria tuberosa, take root in the debris dumps. In the light of these findings, it seems likely that the neotropical myrmecophytes with relatively unaggressive ant occupants are involved in a similar relationship.

Some 19 species of ants belonging to 14 genera have been recorded from Hydnophytum tubers.  The most frequent ant inhabitants were formerly placed in the genus Iridomyrmex Mayr.  The usual species found inhabiting the tubers of ant-plants growing in mangrove swamps as well as coastal & hill savannahs, are small orange colored members of the genus Philidris Shattuck: Philidris cordata (F.Smith) in New Guinea & the Solomon Islands, P. myrmecodiae (Emery) in Borneo, & P. nagasau (Mann) in Fiji.  The larger, black, pungent-smelling species are now placed in Anonychomyrma Donisthorpe.  In New Guinea, Anonychomyrma scrutator (F. Smith) is the more usual occupant of rubiaceous ant-plants, although at least 2 distinct forms are to be found in ant-plant tubers: in closed canopy forest from sea level to 2,500 m, the workers are c. 3 mm in  length, & at altitudes above 2,500 m, a larger, 4 mm long form is found.  Those species with tubers occupied by Philidris spp. include: H. formicarum, Squamellaria guppyana, & H. moseleyanum.  Hydnophytum acuminicalyx has always been found to contain Anonychomyrma spp.  Other species which are always occupied  by  ants, but of varied genera & species, include: H. cordifolium, H. dauloense, H. ferrugineum, H. grandiflorum, H. hellwigii, H. heterophyllum, H. mayuense, H. microphyllum, H. multituberosum, H. orichalcum, H. ovatum, H. puffii, H. petiolatum, H. spathulatum, H. terrestris, H. tortuosum, & Squamellaria vanuatuensis.  The tuber contents of the other species remain unknown, although the evidence, from herbarium material, suggests that they are probably ant-occupied, these include: H. albertisii, H. grandifolium, H. kebarense, H. lauterbachii, H. linearifolium, H. lucidulum, H. magnifolium, H. mamberamoense, H. morotaiense, H. tetrapterum, H. trichomanes, & H. vitisidaea.]",

This fauna includes beetles, Lepidoptera, and others, including spiders.

    "abstract": "Extrafloral nectar (EFN) mediates food-for-protection mutualisms between plants and ants. Such mutualisms exist within a complex web of biotic interactions, and in a framework provided by the abiotic environment. Both biotic and abiotic factors, therefore, affect the outcome of ant-plant interactions. We conducted an experiment to determine the effects of ant activity, and light intensity, on herbivory rates, growth, and reproductive fitness in Senna mexicana var. chapmanii, a perennial legume native to pine rockland habitats of south Florida. Forty plants were divided among four treatments in a factorial experimental design with two independent variables: ant activity and light intensity. Plants were divided equally between sunny and shady habitats, and ants were excluded from half of the plants in each habitat type. The presence of ants significantly reduced herbivory rates in S. chapmanii. In shaded habitats, the presence of ants had no effect on plant reproductive fitness, however, in sunny habitats plants with ants produced significantly more seeds over the duration of the 1-yr study. Ants represent an important biotic defense against herbivores in S. chapmanii; however, their effects on plant fitness are dependent on light conditions. Pine rockland habitats in south Florida have been widely destroyed or mismanaged. In fragments that remain, suppression of fire has led to increased canopy closure and shading of the understory. These changes will likely negatively impact plants that rely on ants for defense. We highlight the importance of conservation efforts to preserve the pine rocklands and the fire regimes on which they rely.          *[Six ant species made up the vast majority of observations: Brachymyrmex obscurior (38.04%), Camponotus \u0002oridanus (19.37%), Solenopsis invicta (19.02%), Camponotus sexguttatus (10.23%), Cardiocondyla emeryi (9.2%), & Pheidole moerens (2.7%).

    "abstract": "Extrafloral nectar mediates food-for-protection mutualisms between plants and ants. Ant-plant mutualisms are keystone associations, occurring within a complex web of biotic interactions. As such, these interactions may affect plant fitness in a number of ways, both positive and negative. In Senna mexicana var. chapmanii (Isely) H. S. Irwin & Barneby (Fabaceae), the presence of ants has been shown to reduce herbivory and increase fruit and seed set. These effects, however, are not the result of only one interaction but the balance of many. We conducted a field study to determine the processes by which ants affect reproductive fitness in S. chapmanii. Thirty plants were established in a semi-natural area adjacent to native pine rockland habitat in southern Florida. Ants were excluded from half of the plants by painting a sticky resin (TanglefootTM) around the base of each stem. Over the course of a single flowering season (Oct-May), we observed the effects of ants on the activity of herbivores, predators, pollinators, and pre-dispersal seed predators. We also observed the overall effects of ants on plant size and reproductive output. Plants with ants were quicker to establish, grew larger, and produced floral displays that attracted more pollinators. Contrary to our expectations, relative pollinator efficiency and rates of pre-dispersal seed predation were unaffected by ants. In S. chapmanii, ants did not appear to affect the outcome of other plant-insect associations, but they affected the scale at which they occurred. Ants facilitated plant growth and establishment in S. chapmanii, with subsequent effects on reproductive investment.   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)          *[During our censuses, a total of 96 ants from 9 species were observed in the inflorescences of Senna chapmanii.  The majority of ant activity within the inflorescences (84%) could be attributed to 4 species: Camponotus floridanus Buckley (25%), Camponotus sexguttatus Fabricius (23.9%), Camponotus planatus   Roger (19.8%), & Brachymyrmex obscurior Forel (14.6%).  A total of 144 ants were observed on the foliage of S.  chapmanii during monthly ant surveys.  The same 4 species found on inflorescences accounted for the majority of ant activity on leaves, representing 15.5%, 9.7%, 9%, & 45% of ant activity, respectively.

Although these core species were dominant in their respective sites, they were not necessarily the most dominant ant species.  Three of the 4 networks (oak forest & grassland in FBSP, & oak forest in MNP) were nested & had a higher number of plant species than ant species.  Although greater specialization was observed in the ant trophic level in the 2 sites & vegetation, possibly due to competition with the more dominant ant species, this was not statistically significant.  In 3 of these networks (grassland & oak forest of MNP & oak forest of FBSP), we found no correlation between the dominance hierarchy & abundance of the ant species & their position within the network.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the interest in complexity of ant\u0010plant relationships has increased considerably. However, because the spatial and biological information generated on ant\u0010plant interaction networks is dispersed in the literature it is necessary to synthesise current information, detect knowledge gaps, and outline needs for research leading to the development of a broad and systematic view on the subject. Here, we present a global synthesis of the scientific articles dealing with ant\u0010plant interaction networks, through a quantitative scientometric analysis to establish the state of the art in this topic and to propose future perspectives. We gather 54 articles published between 2006 and 2020 in 32 different scientific journals, which were written by 132 different authors. The studies were conducted in 15 countries and 9 biomes (most of them (61%) were in tropical lowlands), but Brazil and Mexico represented 87% of the global scientific production. Although most studies are related to ant\u0010plant interactions involving extrafloral nectaries (72%) usually in diurnal samplings, we also found other types of ant\u0010plant relationships such as floral nectar, extrafloral nectar, sap, myrmecophyte, seed/fruit, foraging substrate, and nesting sites. Furthermore, most studies used a bipartite framework of ant\u0010plant interaction mediated by only one type of resource, and researchers often reported a nested pattern of species interactions. Finally, we identify some regions, biotic interactions involving different types of resources, spatio\u0010temporal scales, and research questions that need further research for a better understanding of the complexity ant\u0010plant networks.",

    "abstract": "Host-plant finding by foundress queens is an important step in the establishment of ant-plant symbioses and olfactory cues may play a crucial role in the Macaranga-Crematogaster ant-plant system for attracting foundresses over longer distances. MicroSPE was used to investigate leaf volatiles of 11 myrmecophytic and non-myrmecophytic Macaranga species. Chemical analysis (GC-MS) yielded a total of 114 compounds comprising a great diversity, including aliphatic compounds, aromatics, mono- and sesquiterpenoids. An analysis of the volatile data using the CNESS distances of the chemical profiles, followed by visualization of the data with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showed that even closely related species sharing the same ant partners have clearly different scent patterns. Comparison of spectra of volatile compounds between obligate myrmecophytic Macarena species and myrmecophilous species that are only facultatively associated with unspecific arboreal ants did not reveal general differences. Choice experiments conducted with foundresses revealed that the ants have the capacity to distinguish between different host species. However, the behavior of the foundresses following surface contact with saplings indicates that other cues, like surface structure, may play a more important role in host-recognition over short distances than volatile compounds. We discuss alternative hypotheses for the possible role of leaf volatiles in the examined Macaranga species as chemical defense against herbivores.",

Big-headed ants disrupted the mutualism between native ants (Crematogaster spp.) and the dominant whistling-thorn tree (Vachellia drepanolobium), rendering trees vulnerable to elephant (Loxodonta africana) browsing and resulting in landscapes with higher visibility. Although zebra kills were significantly less likely to occur in higher-visibility, invaded areas, lion numbers did not decline since the onset of the invasion, likely because of prey-switching to African buffalo (Syncerus caffer).

Both concentration of resources in the reproductive tissue of Malpighiaceae and the existence of sequential flowering periods may be important factors involved in the evolution of oligophagy in Allosmaitia.  Field and laboratory observations showed that larvae of A. strophius are ignored by tending ants besides the presence of the dorsal nectar organ (DNO).

The research was caried out in Sambik Rindang & Sambik Jengkel, West Lombok from May to November 2003.  There were 3 activities of research (a) field trial, (b) semi-field tial, & (c) glass house trial.  In the field trial, the environment conditions were not treated as fixed variables, the observations were done by sampling.  This field trial was supported by semi-field trial, where only one factor was used as a treatment (ant populations with 3 population levels: 0, 5, &10 colonies per 5 plants).  The semi-field trial was also supported by glass house trial.  In this trial, 3 factors were used as treatments: ant population, Helopeltis spp., & Sanurus indecora populations.  In Sambik Jengkel, Helopeltis spp. was dominant pest, while in Sambik Rindang it was S. indecora.  Ants had an impotant role in controlling Helopeltis populations.  The data obtained up to October 2003 revealed that the percentage of damaged shoots was less in the ants-invested plant than that without ants.  Meanwhile, the population of S. indecora was not affected by ants incidence, however the number of flowers atacked by S. indecora were more in the shoots without ants.  If shoots were previously attacked by S. indecora, the ants would not bother the insects, but when there was no Helopeltis spp. in the plant, the ants would attack the nymphs of S. indecora.]",

Seeds in the smallest droppings stood the least chance of being removed.  Although soil-nesting ants of the tribe Attini were the primary removers of seeds in this forest, 1/3 of the removal was by ants living in ephemeral litter nests.  Seeds of M. affinis were found in litter ant nests in 8 of 28 1-m2 plots, suggesting that seed rain was not highly localized.

    "abstract": "When aphids parasitize plants with extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and aphid colony size is small, ants frequently use EFNs but hardly tend aphids. However, as the aphid colony size increases, ants stop using EFNs and strengthen their associations with aphids. Although the shift in ant behavior is important for determining the dynamics of the ant-plant-aphid interaction, it is not known why this shift occurs. Here, we test two hypotheses to explain the mechanism responsible for this behavioral shift: (1) Extrafloral nectar secretion changes in response to aphid herbivory, or (2) plants do not change extrafloral nectar secretion, but the total reward to ants from aphids will exceed that from EFNs above a certain aphid colony size. To judge which mechanism is plausible, we investigated secretion patterns of extrafloral nectar produced by plants with and without aphids, compared the amount of sugar supplied by EFNs and aphids, and examined whether extrafloral nectar or honeydew was more attractive to ants. Our results show that there was no inducible extrafloral secretion in response to aphid herbivory, but the sugar concentration in extrafloral nectar was higher than in honeydew, and more ant workers were attracted to an artificial extrafloral nectar solution than to an artificial aphid honeydew solution. These results indicate that extrafloral nectar is a more attractive reward than aphid honeydew per unit volume. However, even an aphid colony containing only two individuals can supply a greater reward to ants than EFNs. This suggests that the ant behavioral shift may be explained by the second hypothesis.",

To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of indirect ant-mediated defense via extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), we compared the herbivory pressure, leaf chemicals, vegetative growth, and reproduction between two species of vetches, Vicia sativa var. angustifolia (Reichard) Wahlenb (Leguminosae) with EFNs and V. hirsuta (L.) SF Gray without EFNs (or with very small EFNs). Indirect ant defense of V. sativa was not consistently reliable because of the low constancy of ant attraction. In addition, V. sativa was more vulnerable to attack by herbivores than V. hirsuta. The estimated total amount of sugars secreted by EFNs of V. sativa corresponded to 0.5% of total leaf biomass, and 0.07% of total plant biomass, indicating a low investment to the production of extrafloral nectar. Vicia sativa plants grew more rapidly than V. hirsuta plants during the reproductive stage. Therefore, we consider that V. sativa adopts the ant defense via EFNs in spite of its low reliability because the indirect ant defense supported by EFNs requires only low investment, allowing the plants to attain rapid growth in the early spring.",

Vascular epiphytes growing on the giant bamboo Gigantochloa scortechinii (Poaceae) were collected at Ulu Gombak, West Malaysia.  Sixteen epiphyte species were growing in carton-nests of 7 ant species.  All epiphytes on bamboo were associated with ants.  The most frequent ant species (Crematogaster sp.1, Myrmicinae) apparently nests only on bamboo.  It was tested for its behavior towards the seeds of 3 epiphyte species (Dischidia nummularia (Asclepiadaceae), Aeschynanthus albidus & Aeschynanthus fecundus,  (Gesneriaceae)), & one non-epiphyte species (Emilia sonchifolia (Asteraceae)).  Most of the offered epiphytes' seeds were carried to the nest, while the seeds of the non-epiphyte were ignored or even discarded.  There were no species-specific differences among the epiphytes' seeds. We hypothesize that seed-collecting behavior is necessary for the establishment of ant-garden associations & for the colonization of bamboo culms by epiphytes.  The smooth-surfaced & relatively short-lived bamboo culms would not host epiphytes without the mediation of the ants.  We suspect that ants may also have a great influence on the distribution of epiphytes on other hosts.  In this paper we describe ants as active nest builders & seed collectors that give certain epiphytes the opportunity to live in open & sun exposed habitats on bamboo. Benefits to the ants are discussed as well.]",

    "abstract": "*[We used a novel text-mining approach to determine which ant species associate with plants in defensive or seed dispersal mutualisms.  We investigated patterns of lineage diversification across a recent ant phylogeny using BiSSE, BAMM, & HiSSE models.  Ants that associate mutualistically with plants had elevated diversification rates compared to non-mutualistic ants in the BiSSE model, with a similar trend in BAMM, suggesting ants & plants cooperate-and-radiate.  However, the best-fitting model was a HiSSE model with a hidden state, meaning that diversification models that do not account for unmeasured traits are inappropriate to assess the relationship between mutualism & ant diversification.  Against a backdrop of diversification rate heterogeneity, the best-fitting HiSSE model found that mutualism actually decreases diversification: mutualism evolved much more frequently in rapidly diversifying ant lineages, but then subsequently slowed diversification.  Thus, it appears that ant lineages first radiated, then cooperated with plants.]          *[ We studied whether mutualism also increases evolutionary success by affecting lineage diversification, or the net result of the formation & loss of species over evolutionary time (i.e., speciation minus extinction).  We focused on the widespread mutualism between ants & plants, in which ants act as protective 'bodyguards' or seed dispersers for plants & gain food or shelter in return.  Previous research has found that the evolution of ant-plant mutualisms increased plant diversification.  We asked whether the same is true for ant diversification.  We used a novel, automated approach to gather trait data from the abstracts of over 89,000 scientific articles about ants, & identified 432 mutualistic ant species & 2,909 non-mutualistic ant species.  We then used this trait information to model how mutualism has evolved & influenced diversification across a recent ant phylogeny.  Our analysis suggests that instead of causally enhancing diversification, mutualism evolves more often in lineages that are already diversifying quickly & then slows ant diversification.]          *[Wojcik misspelled Wojick.]",

The mutualist Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus is an obligate plant-ant and fully depends on acacias for nesting space & food.  The parasite Pseudomyrmex gracilis facultatively nests on acacias & uses host-derived food rewards, but also external food sources.  Integrative analyses of genetic microsatellite data, cuticular hydrocarbons, & behavioral assays showed that an individual acacia might be inhabited by the workers of several P. gracilis queens, whereas one P. ferrugineus colony monopolizes one or more host trees.  Despite these differences in social organization, neither of the species exhibited aggressive behavior among conspecific workers sharing a tree regardless of their relatedness.  This lack of aggression corresponds to the high similarity of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles among ants living on the same tree.  Host sharing by unrelated colonies, or the presence of several queens in a single colony are discussed as strategies by which parasite colonies could achieve the observed social organization.]",

    "abstract": "*[We investigated whether this extrafloral nectar can also exclude exploiters, that is nondefending ant species.  Mutualist workers discriminated against sucrose whereas exploiters & generalists with no affinity toward Acacia myrmecophytes preferred sucrose, because mutualist workers lacked the sucrose-cleaving enzyme invertase, which is present in workers of the other 2 groups.  Sucrose uptake induced invertase activity in workers of parasites & generalists, but not mutualists, & in larvae of all species.  The mutualists loose invertase during their ontogeny.  This reduced metabolic capacity ties the mutualists to their plant hosts, but it does not completely prevent the mutualism from exploitation.  We therefore investigated whether the exploiters studied here are cheaters (i.e., have evolved from former mutualists) or parasites (exploiters with no mutualistic ancestor).  A molecular phylogeny demonstrates that the exploiter species did not evolve from former mutualists, & no evidence for cheaters was found.  We conclude that being specialized to their partner can prevent mutualists from becoming cheaters, whereas other mechanisms are required to stabilize a mutualism against the exploitation by parasites.]",

    "abstract": "In ant-plant protection mutualisms, plants provide nesting space and nutrition to defending ants. Several plant-ants are polygynous. Possessing more than one queen per colony can reduce nestmate relatedness and consequently the inclusive fitness of workers. Here, we investigated the colony structure of the obligate acacia-ant Pseudomyrmex peperi, which competes for nesting space with several congeneric and sympatric species. Pseudomyrmex peperi had a lower colony founding success than its congeners and thus, appears to be competitively inferior during the early stages of colony development. Aggression assays showed that P. peperi establishes distinct, but highly polygynous supercolonies, which can inhabit large clusters of host trees. Analysing queens, workers, males and virgin queens from two supercolonies with eight polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed a maximum of three alleles per locus within a colony and, thus, high relatedness among nestmates. Colonies had probably been founded by one singly mated queen and supercolonies resulted from intranidal mating among colony-derived males and daughter queens. This strategy allows colonies to grow by budding and to occupy individual plant clusters for time spans that are longer than an individual queen's life. Ancestral states reconstruction indicated that polygyny represents the derived state within obligate acacia-ants. We suggest that the extreme polygyny of Pseudomyrmex peperi, which is achieved by intranidal mating and thereby maintains high nestmate relatedness, might play an important role for species coexistence in a dynamic and competitive habitat.",

    "abstract": "Although most studies of mutualisms focus on a single partner at a time, host species often associate with multiple mutualist partners simultaneously. Because of potential interactions between mutualists, only studying a single type of mutualism could lead to a biased perspective of mutualism benefit and how mutualisms may scale-up to affect communities. The legume Chamaecrista fasciculata engages in a resource mutualism with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and also forms symbiotic interactions with ants by providing nectar in exchange for defense against herbivores. Although they provide very different benefits to the plant, both mutualists receive carbon resources from the plant. As a result, these two mutualists are likely to interact, potentially competing for carbon resources or mutually benefitting each other via their positive effects on plant hosts. In a full-factorial field experiment, we explored how rhizobia and ants influence one another, C. fasciculata fitness, and the associated arthropod community. Ants reduced plant allocation to rhizobia, but ants also increased rhizobia contamination of uninoculated plants, suggesting that ants may disperse rhizobia. In turn, rhizobia increased ant abundances, with ants preferentially tending plants with rhizobia. Chamaecrista fasciculata received substantial fitness benefits from rhizobia; in contrast, associating with ants reduced fitness. Additionally, the mutualists interacted to influence the abundance of other arthropods found on the plants. Rhizobia increased arthropod abundances, likely because more nitrogen-rich leaf tissue was more attractive to arthropod herbivores, but ants negated these increases. As these results illustrate, multiple mutualists may interact, influencing each other\u0019s abundance and the abundance of other community members.          *[While we did not record the species of each individual ant visiting the plants, the most common species observed included: Formica pallidefulva, Lasius neoniger, Myrmica americana, Nylanderia parvula, & Prenolepis imparis.]",

    "abstract": "Many insect herbivores are dietary specialists capable of sequestering the secondary metabolites produced by their host plants. These defensive compounds have important but complex implications for tritrophic interactions between plants, herbivores, and natural enemies. The sequestration of host plant secondary metabolites defends herbivores from attack by generalist predators, but may also compromise the immune response, making insect herbivores more vulnerable to parasitism. Here, we investigate the role of plant secondary metabolites in mediating interactions between a specialist herbivore and its natural enemies. The host plants are two Penstemon species, Penstemon glaber and Penstemon virgatus, which are chemically defended by iridoid glycosides (IGs). First, we examined how Penstemon iridoid glycoside content influences the sequestration of IGs by a specialist herbivore, Euphydryas anicia. Then, we performed ant bioassays to assess how host plant species influences larval susceptibility to predators and phenoloxidase assays to assess the immunocompetence and potential vulnerability to parasitoids and pathogens. We found that the concentration of IGs sequestered by E. anicia larvae varied with host plant diet. Larvae reared on P. glaber sequestered more IGs than larvae reared on P. virgatus. Yet, ant predators found larvae unpalatable regardless of host plant diet and were also repelled by sugar solutions containing isolated IGs. However, E. anicia larvae reared on P. glaber showed higher levels of phenoloxidase activity than larvae reared on P. virgatus. Our results suggest that the sequestration of some secondary metabolites can effectively protect herbivores from predation, yet may also increase vulnerability to parasitism via decreased immunocompetence.",

During the experiment, in the absence of ants, plants growing in sunlight were shorter, developed fewer leaves and leaflets, were more damaged by herbivores, had half the total dry biomass, and died more frequently than plants visited by ants.

Many myrmecochorous (ant-dispersed) plant species are lacking in these forests decades after land abandonment despite being present in residual stands. To determine if disruption to this ant\u0013plant mutualism can partially explain the current distribution patterns of myrmecochorous plants, we quantified the proportion of seeds removed by ants while accounting for predation by rodents in residual and post-agricultural forests. We experimentally manipulated ant access and controlled for rodent access to seeds of 3 myrmecochorous understory herbs in 3 paired residual and post-agricultural forests in central New York. We identified Aphaenogaster rudis as the primary seed disperser. We found no difference in mean (\u00b1 1 SE) proportion of seeds removed by ants between residual stands (73.7% \u00b1 7.7%) and post-agricultural stands (75.8% \u00b1 7.9%). Rodents removed few to no seeds (5.3% \u00b1 1.5%), but an invasive slug, Arion subfuscus (Dusky Arion), was observed removing elaiosomes from seeds in both stand types. Our data indicated neither a lack of ant-dispersal activity nor excessive rodent predation would be limiting to dispersal of myrmecochorous seeds in post-agricultural forests during the period of our study. Given the presence of A. rudis in post-agricultural stands, programs to assist plant migration will likely be sufficient to reestablish this ant\u0013plant mutualism in degraded sites.",

    "abstract": "Nectaries are structures that secrete a sugary solution and can occur on vegetative and/or reproductive parts of plants. The significance of floral nectaries to reward vertebrate and arthropod pollinators is well supported. The role of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) is more ambiguous, though research has been skewed to the ant-plant mutualism. Many other insects feed at EFNs, but these interactions are vastly understudied. This study addresses the hypothesis that EFNs may influence the occurrence and structure of Neotropical canopy beetle communities. Seven canopy trees (four families) exhibiting EFNs and their associated beetles were studied over a one-year period in southern Venezuela. In total, 6818 adult beetles identified to 868 species were recorded on 25 investigated canopy tree species (#47 individuals). Of the 868 beetle species, 150 species (517 individuals; 17.3% species) from 20 families were observed drinking from foliar EFNs on seven EFN-bearing tree species. Dietary dependence on EF nectar varied, with 95 beetle species utilising this nectar within a broader diet and 55 species found feeding exclusively on EFNs. This study demonstrates unequivocally that EF nectar is a frequently utilised food resource of many beetle adults and beetles have been a significantly underestimated visitor group. A more detailed study was conducted on six individual canopy trees of two species of Chrysobalanaceae, Licania hebantha Mart. ex Hook. f. and Moquilea subarachnophylla (Cuatrec.) Sothers and Prance. In total, 115 individual adults of 64 beetle species were collected on nectar secreted on newly-sprouted leaves. These beetle assemblages were dominated by species utilising EF nectar and were associated with distinct phenological phases of the host trees. Altogether, the beetle survey found support for the hypothesis that EFNs influence the occurrence and structure of beetle communities. These beetle-EFN relationships have implications for spatial arrangement, community assembly and evolution of both host plants and beetles. Like ant-EFN mutualism, EFN-bearing trees and beetles may also form mutualism. It is possible that the plants offer easier access to a nutritious resource that may deflect herbivory of vegetative parts.",

Furthermore, we provide a worldwide review of other ant-hopper interactions inside ant-built structures & compare their nature (obligate versus facultative) & distribution within the suborder Auchenorrhyncha.  The novel interactions were observed in  located at the tree trunk bases or along the whole trunks. Only immature planthopper stages were found inside nests, so full species identifications were not possible.  However, nymph morphology & molecular data (18S and Coi genes) indicated 4 related species of the family Flatidae (infraorder Fulgoromorpha) associated with Pseudolasius.  Ant-planthopper occurrences were relatively rare (6% of all trophobiotic interactions) & peaked at mid-elevation (900 m above sea level).  Pseudolasius was the only genus associated with planthoppers in the communities, with most cases monopolized by a single species, P. breviceps Emery, 1887.  In contrast, all other ant genera tended various scale insects (Sternorrhyncha: Coccoidea).  This apparent partner-specificity is rare: World wide, there are only about ten reported cases of obligate symbiosis in ant nests, distributed in 5 of the 33 Auchenorrhyncha families.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies have shown that small structures on plant surfaces serve ecological functions such as resistance against herbivores. The morphology, distribution, chemical composition and changes during shoot and leaf development of such small structures were examined on Paulownia tomentosa. METHODS: The morphology and distribution of the structures were studied under light microscopy, and their chemical composition was analyzed using thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. To further investigate the function of these structures, several simple field experiments and observations were also conducted. KEY RESULTS: Three types of small structures on P. tomentosa were investigated: bowl-shaped organs, glandular hairs and dendritic trichomes. The bowl-shaped organs were densely aggregated on the leaves near flower buds and were determined to be extrafloral nectarines (EFNs) that secrete sugar and attract ants. Nectar production of these organs was increased by artificial damage to the leaves, suggesting an anti-herbivore function through symbiosis with ants. Glandular hairs were found on the surfaces of young and/or reproductive organs. Glandular hairs on leaves, stems and flowers secreted mucilage containing glycerides and trapped small insects. Secretions from glandular hairs on flowers and immature fruits contained flavonoids, which may provide protection against some herbivores. Yellow dendritic trichomes on the adaxial side of leaves also contained flavonoids identical to those secreted by the glandular hairs on fruits and flowers. Three special types of leaves, which differed from the standard leaves in shape, size and identity of small structures, developed near young shoot tips or young flower buds. The density of small structures on these leaf types was higher than on standard leaves, suggesting that these leaf types may be specialized to protect young leaves or reproductive organs. Changes in the small structures during leaf development suggested that leaves of P. tomentosa are primarily protected by glandular hairs and dendritic trichomes at young stages and by the EFNs at mature stages. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that P. tomentosa protects young and/or reproductive organs from herbivores through the distribution and allocation of small structures, the nature of which depends on the developmental stage of leaves and shoots.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the outcomes of any mutualistic interaction between ants and plants can be a very difficult task, since these outcomes are often determined by the ecological context in which the interacting species are embedded. Network theory has been an important tool to improve our understanding about the organizational patterns of animal-plant interactions. Nevertheless, traditionally, network studies have focused mainly on species-based differences and ignoring the importance of individual differences within populations. In this study, we evaluated if downscaling an ant\u0013plant network from species to the individual level results in structural and functional changes in a network involving different-sized plant individuals. For this, we studied the extrafloral-nectar producing-tree Caryocar brasiliense (Caryocaraceae) and their associated ants in a Neotropical savanna. We observed 254 interactions involving 43 individuals of C. brasiliense and 47 ant species. The individual-based ant-plant network exhibited a nested pattern of interactions, with all developmental stages contributing equally to structuring this non-random pattern. We also found that plants with greater centrality within the network were better protected by their ant partners. However, plants with higher levels of individual specialization were not necessarily better protected by ants. Overall, we presented empirical evidence that intra-population variations are important for shaping ant-plant networks, since they can change the level of protection against herbivores conferred by the ants. These results highlight the importance of individual-based analyses of ecological networks, opening new research venues in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of ant-plant interactions.          *[Nylanderia incorrectly listed with Myrmicinae, it is a Formicinae.]",

    "abstract": "The outcome of any interspecific interaction is often determined by the ecological context in which the interacting species are embedded. Plant ontogeny may represent an important source of variation in the outcome of ant-plant mutualisms, as the level of investment in ant rewards, in alternative (non-biotic) defenses, or both, may be modulated by the plant's developmental stage. In addition, the abundance and identities of the ants involved in the interaction may change during ontogeny of the host-plant. Here, we evaluated if plant ontogeny affects the interaction between ants and a savanna tree species (Caryocar brasiliense) that produces extrafloral nectar. We found fewer ants per branch and fewer species of ants per tree in juvenile than in reproductive trees of medium and large size. In addition, large-sized reproductive trees were more likely to host more aggressive ants than were medium-sized reproductive or juvenile trees. Such differences strongly affected the outcome of the interaction between ants and their host-plants, as the magnitude of the effect of ants on herbivory was much stronger for large trees than for juvenile ones. The fact that we did not find significant ontogenetic variation in the concentration of leaf tannins suggests that the observed differences in herbivory did not result from a differential investment in chemical defenses among different-sized plants. Overall, the results of our study indicate that the developmental stage of the host plant is an important factor of conditionality in the interaction between C. brasiliense and arboreal foraging ants.",

The flowering of white dogwood in 2008 lasted 35 days, and the lifespan of a single flower was 3 days. The number of flowers per inflorescence was variable (on the average, it was 89). The largest group of insects visiting the flowers of C. alba comprised Hymenoptera (mainly bees and andrenids), then ants, dipterans and beetles. They foraged the dogwood flowers most intensively between 11.00 and 15.00. The inconspicuous four-petalled flowers of C. alba were characterised by the occurrence of T-shaped, two-armed non-glandular trichomes covering the receptacle as well as observed on the petals of the corolla, the style of the pistil and the anthers in a smaller number. The trichomes were covered by a thick cuticle with characteristic outgrowths. They contained a living protoplast, and plastids were observed in the cytoplasm of the trichome cells. In addition, anomocytic stomata were found in the epidermis of the receptacle and in the epidermis of the corolla petals. The stigma of the pistil and the adaxial epidermis of the petals were composed of very numerous conical papillae.",

The elaiosome is a food resource for ants, whereas the seed is an energy source for subsequent germination and plant establishment. Although myrmecochory occurs in many phylogenetically unrelated lineages, multiple phylogenetic lineages display similar variation in elaiosome and seed metabolite composition due to convergent evolution. We focused on four families (Amaryllidaceae, Boraginaceae, Papaveraceae and Poaceae) each represented by two species from different genera. Diaspores of three populations per species were sampled and concentrations of 60 metabolites from five groups (amino acids, fatty acids, organic acids, polyols and sugars) were determined for both elaiosomes and seeds. Variability in metabolite composition was decomposed by hierarchical ANOVA and variation partitioning using redundancy analysis (reflecting both species nested within families, crossed with seed vs. elaiosome). Differences in the metabolite composition of elaiosomes and seeds were consistent across multiple phylogenetic origins (with more pronounced differences at the level of individual metabolites than at the level of metabolite groups) and supported the idea of convergent evolution under strong selection pressure. Elaiosomes contained higher amounts of easily digestible metabolites (especially amino acids) than seeds. Fatty acids were not more concentrated in elaiosomes, which contradicts the literal translation of \u001celaiosome\u001d (=\toil body). The differentiation of metabolite composition closely reflected taxonomic relatedness, particularly at the family level. Differences among populations within species were small, so the metabolite composition can thus be considered as a trait with relatively low intraspecific variability.",

    "abstract": "*[A field experiment was conducted with outplantings of the native perennial shrub Senna mexicana var. chapmanii in a semi-natural area, adjacent to native pine rockland habitat in southern Florida.  The presence of ants & the availability of extrafloral nectar were manipulated in a stratified random design.  Insect communities were monitored & recorded over a period of 6 months.  Herbivores on S. chapmanii included immature stages of 3 pierid butterflies, & adult weevils.  Eight species of ants were associated with the plants, & other predators included spiders, ladybugs, wasps, & hemipterans.  Parasitic, haemolymph-sucking midges (Ceratopogonidae) & parasitoid flies were also associated with the caterpillar herbivores, & possibly the extrafloral nectaries of the plants.  The presence of ants did not appear to influence oviposition by butterflies, as numbers of lepidopterans of all developmental stages did not differ among treatments.  Significantly more late instar caterpillars, however, were observed on plants with ants excluded, indicating that ants remove small caterpillars from plants.  Substantially more alternative predators (spiders, ladybugs, wasps) were observed on plants with ants excluded.  Rates of parasitization did not differ among the treatments, but there were substantially fewer caterpillars succumbing to virus among those collected from control plants.  We provide a rare look at facultative ant-plant mutualisms in the context of the many other interactions with which they overlap.  We conclude that ants provide some biotic defense against herbivores on S. chapmanii, & plants benefit overall from the presence of ants, despite negative impacts on non-ant predators.]",

    "abstract": "1 Many plant species respond to herbivory with increased emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): these attract carnivorous arthropods and thereby function as an indirect defence mechanism. Whether neighbouring plants can \u0018eavesdrop\u0019 on such airborne cues and tailor their defences accordingly, remains controversial. 2 We used Lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) to investigate whether herbivore-induced VOCs induce another indirect defence strategy, i.e. the secretion of extrafloral nectar (EFN) in conspecific plant neighbours, and whether this enhances the defence status of the receiving plant under natural conditions. 3 EFN secretion was induced by VOCs released from herbivore-damaged bean tendrils as well as by a synthetic VOC mixture resembling the natural one. One constituent of the herbivore-induced blend - the green leaf volatile (3Z)-hex-3-enyl acetate - was sufficient to elicit the defence reaction. 4 A long-term experiment comparing the defensive effect of EFN alone with the VOC-mediated effect (EFN induction plus attraction of plant defenders) suggested that Lima bean benefits from both indirect defences. Repeated treatment of tendrils with either an artificial blend of VOCs or with EFN led to the attraction of a higher cumulative number of predatory and parasitoid insects (i.e. ants and wasps) as well as to less herbivore damage and an increased production of inflorescences and leaves. 5 Our results demonstrate that one indirect defence mechanism can induce another one in conspecific plants, and that Lima bean plants can benefit from this VOC-induced EFN secretion under natural conditions. Both extrafloral nectaries and the capability to release VOCs upon herbivory are present in many plant taxa and airborne signalling may thus represent a common mechanism for regulating the secretion of EFN in plant parts which face an increased risk of herbivory.",

Ocotea seedlings produce specialized nodules on the main stem that are used as domatia by founding queens. In this study, Ocotea seedlings were colonized by multiple haplometrotically founding M. flavocotea queens. Mature colonies typically had only a single queen, apparently as a result of secondary monogyny. The number of foundress queens per tree was positively correlated with seedling height and stem diameter (nesting space) at time of colony founding. The extent to which foundress queens cooperate in colony founding is not known. Nonetheless, colony establishment by multiple foundress queens may be critical in ensuring the successful founding by at least one queen, thus allowing the perpetuation of the Myrmelachista-Ocotea interaction.",

    "abstract": "In view of the ongoing rarity of Ecbolium ligustrinum there is an urgent need for conservation of the species. For this, a detailed work was carried out regarding the untold story of its reproductive ecology. The work was done for three consecutive years (2015\u00132017) at Midnapore, West Bengal over three different populations collected from three different areas of West Bengal. Field data were also recorded from these three wild populations. The species produces gullet flowers with bi-labiate corolla having long slender tubes. The flowers exhibit one day of longevity. The flowers are visited by 10 species of insects. Among those, four species viz. Eristalis tenax, a Dipteran member and three ant species of Hymenoptera such as Camponotus sp., Formica sp. and Monomorium sp. are the effective pollinators. As per pollination efficiency, Eristalis tenax (PE i = 0.76) is the most successful one. The flowers are shortly protandrous (dichogamous) and passed by three distinct reproductive (male, bisexual and female) phases. The breeding system clearly depicts that the species is facultatively xenogamous supported by myophilous mode of pollination. However, geitonogamous type of pollination is also observed through myrmecophily, an atypical instance found in plants. Lastly, the plant retained some sort of autogamy through \u0018fail-safe\u0019 mechanism of pollination, an adaptation which might be developed in absence of pollinators. Therefore, undoubtedly it can be concluded that E. ligustrinum is a partially self-incompatible (ISI = 0.27) species having a mixed mating system, adapted for xenogamy through specialised mode of plant-pollinator interactions.           *[NOTE: These identifications need to be checked.

Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of plant defenses against their herbivores may be central for our understanding of tropical biodiversity. Here, we address the evolution of antiherbivore defenses and their possible contribution to coexistence in the Neotropical tree genus Inga (Fabaceae). Inga has >300 species, has radiated recently, and is frequently one of the most diverse and abundant genera at a given site. For 37 species from Panama and Peru we characterized developmental, ant, and chemical defenses against herbivores. We found extensive variation in defenses, but little evidence of phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, developmental, ant, and chemical defenses varied independently (were orthogonal) and appear to have evolved independently of each other. Our results are consistent with strong selection for divergent defensive traits, presumably mediated by herbivores. In an analysis of community assembly, we found that Inga species co-occurring as neighbors are more different in antiherbivore defenses than random, suggesting that possessing a rare defense phenotype increases fitness. These results imply that interactions with herbivores may be an important axis of niche differentiation that permits the coexistence of many species of Inga within a single site. Interactions between plants and their herbivores likely play a key role in the generation and maintenance of the conspicuously high plant diversity in the tropics.",

Despite widespread designation of the interaction between ants and extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) as a mutualism and over 100 years of studies on ant benefits to plants, the benefits to ants have never been experimentally quantified. The success of invasive ants is thought to be linked to the availability of carbohydrate-rich resources, though reports of invasive ant visits to EFNs are mixed. In two laboratory experiments, we compared worker survival of one native (Iridomyrmex chasei) and two invasive ant species (Linepithema humile and Pheidole megacephala) exposed to herbivorized or non-herbivorized EFN-bearing plants (Acacia saligna) or positive and negative controls. We found that non-herbivorized plants did not produce any measurable extrafloral nectar, and ants with access to non-herbivorized plants had the same survival as ants with access to an artificial plant and water (unfed ants). Ants given herbivorized plants had 7-11 times greater worker survival relative to unfed ants, but there were no differences in survival between native and invasive ants exposed to herbivorized plants. Our results reveal that ants cannot induce A. saligna extrafloral nectar production, but workers of both native and invasive ant species can benefit from extrafloral nectar as much as they benefit from sucrose.",

Invasive and native ants are both attracted to plants that offer extrafloral nectar, but few studies have compared their abilities to displace herbivores and benefit plants. Yellow crazy ants Anoplolepis gracilipes have invaded eucalypt woodlands of Arnhem Land, northern Australia, where they displace the native dominant weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina. We compared the plant defense services provided by A. gracilipes and O. smaragdina ants on trees with (Acacia lamprocarpa) and without (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) extrafloral nectar rewards through surrogate herbivore (termite) addition experiments and surveys of herbivore damage. Anoplolepis gracilipes were more likely than O. smaragdina to discover termites on A. lamprocarpa, but the likelihood of termite discovery on E. tetrodonta did not vary with ant species. Anoplolepis gracilipes were also more thorough in their attacks of termites, recruited 3.4-4 times more workers to termites, and were 3.4 times quicker at discovering termites on A. lamprocarpa than were O. smaragdina. Discovery of termites by other predators did not vary significantly between trees in A. gracilipes and O. smaragdina sites. Herbivory scores did not reflect the foliage patrolling pattern by the ants. Old A. lamprocarpa leaves and both new and old leaves and branches on E. tetrodonta in A. gracilipes sites had higher chewing herbivory scores than their counterparts in O. smaragdina sites. Our results reveal that the more aggressive and efficient foliar patrolling by A. gracilipes does not translate to increased plant protection.

We conducted this study to test the hypothesis that AMF can also affect insects involved in protection-for-food mutualisms. We examined the constitutive and inducible production of food rewards [extrafloral (EF) nectaries] in Vicia faba plants by manipulating the presence/absence of AMF and by simulating various levels of herbivory. Plants inoculated with AMF produced significantly fewer EF nectaries than uninoculated plants, even after accounting for differences in plant growth. In contrast to earlier studies, EF nectaries were not inducible: damaged plants produced significantly fewer EF nectaries than undamaged plants. Moreover, the effects of mycorrhizal and damage status on EF nectary production were additive. The reduction in EF nectaries in mycorrhizal plants potentially represents a mechanism for indirect effects of AMF on the protective insects that exploit EF nectaries as a food source (e.g., ants).  Reduced reward size should result in reduced protection by ants, and could therefore be a previously unappreciated cost of the mycorrhizal symbiosis to host plants. However, the overall effect of AMF will depend upon the extent to which the reduction of EF nectaries affects the number and activity of ants and the extent to which AMF alter other aspects of host plant physiology. Our results emphasize the complexity of multitrophic interactions, particularly those that span belowground and aboveground ecology.",

However, very few studies have considered these mutualisms from the ant, rather than the plant, perspective. In particular, a whole-colony perspective that takes into account the spatial structure and nest arrangement of the ant colonies that visit these plants has been lacking, obscuring when and how colony-level foraging decisions might affect tending rates on individual plants. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that recruitment of Crematogaster opuntiae (Buren) ant workers to the EFN-secreting cactus Ferocactus wislizeni (Englem) is not independent between plants up to 5 m apart. Colony territories of C. opuntiae are large, covering areas of up to 5,000 m2, and workers visit between five and 34 EFN-secreting barrel cacti within the territories. These ants are highly polydomous, with up to 20 nest entrances dispersed throughout the territory and interconnected by trail networks. Our study demonstrates that worker recruitment is not independent within large polydomous ant colonies, highlighting the importance of considering colonies rather than individual workers as the relevant study unit within ant/plant protection mutualisms.          *[At least 25 species of ants are associated with F. wislizeni across southern Arizona (M.

The study was conducted in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil.  Bimonthly collections were established, where 30 expanding fronds & 30 fully expanded fronds were randomly marked.  In each 1-hour shift starting at 8:30 am & ending at 5:30 pm, the fronds were observed for the presence of ants.  Thirty three ant species were recorded on the Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum fronds, distributed in 6 subfamilies & 13 genera.  The most abundant species were Solenopsis sp.1 & Ectatomma tuberculatum.  Eight ant species were observed foraging the nectaries of tropical bracken fern fronds.  Ectatomma tuberculatum has been observed feeding on the nectaries & patrolling the fronds.  The ant activity peak was on mid-day during the rainy season.  The tropical bracken fern Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum has a rich (currently the highest recorded ant fauna on Pteridium species) & diverse ant community on its fronds, mainly on the expanding fronds.  The presence of generalist predatory ants (Ectatomma tuberculatum & Solenopsis sp.1) during the entire study period suggests a positive interaction between ants & Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum.]          *[In Table 1: Nylanderia incorrectly placed in Myrmicinae; it is a Formicinae.]",

The plant species studied were Caryocar brasiliense, Lafoensia pacari, Ouratea hexasperma, O. spectabilis, Qualea grandiflora, Q. multiflora, Q. parviflora, Stryphnodendron adstringens, & S. polyphyllum.  In total, 34 ant species were associated with 9 plant species.  The interactions network formed by these 2 groups of organisms exhibited similar characteristics to other mutualistic networks, such as nestedness, asymmetry in specialization, & low specialty.  This pattern held during the 2 years of study, although there were changes in number of associations & the ant species present in the network.  The peak of associations between plants & ants occurred at the beginning of the rainy season, coinciding with the months of activity of the extrafloral nectaries of all species studied.  In this period, the protection of ants against leaf herbivory was more efficient compared with the period of inactivity of nectaries.  Experiments of ant exclusion showed that protection against leaf herbivory was effective for all species in the 2 years of study.  For some species analyzed individually, the reduction of herbivory was not significant.  This fact may be related to the attractiveness of plants to ants, represented by the quality of extrafloral nectar, which varied between plant species & among periods of the day (morning, afternoon, evening).  Temporal partition of the species of ants foraging on plants was observed in this study, suggesting the existence of resource competition among species.]",

    "abstract": "Temporal variation has been one remarkable feature of ecological interactions. In ant-plant mutualism, this variation is widely known, although little is understood about the mechanisms that shape these variations.  This study tested whether or not the phenology of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) influences the temporal variation of two properties of an ant-plant interaction network.  The network under investigation exhibited a nested pattern and low specialisation over most months. Monthly nestedness and specialisation in the network were negatively correlated, both being influenced by temporal variations in extrafloral nectar production of the plant community. The months of highest activity in the nectaries (August-November) were those when the level of generalisation in the network was at its highest. Although there were temporal variations in the properties of the network, the generalist core of the species remained the same over time.  The stable core enhances the coevolutionary importance of ant-plant interactions for the community. Thus, it can be concluded that the phenology of EFNs is one effective mechanism shaping the temporal variation in ant-plant interaction.",

    "abstract": "Myrmecochory, a type of ant-mediated seed dispersal, is a diffuse, widespread mutualism in which both partners are purported to benefit from the services or rewards of the other. However, ant benefits in this interaction are conflicted and understudied, especially in the context of microbial third parties. Here, we investigate the effect of a myrmecochore plant-produced antimicrobial chemical (sanguinarine) on the growth of a common entomopathogenic fungus (Beauveria bassiana). We then explore whether sanguinarine, through its effect on entomopathogen growth, might influence ant survival and foraging behavior. At high concentrations, sanguinarine increased the growth of B. bassiana, but fungal growth was not affected at concentrations of sanguinarine near natural levels produced in seeds. When ant colonies were exposed to B. bassiana, survival was not affected by a sanguinarine-supplemented diet. Furthermore, ant foraging patterns (preference for or avoidance of food items with sanguinarine) did not change when ants were exposed to the entomopathogen. Though sanguinarine promotes the growth of an entomopathogen at higher concentrations, which might pose an additional risk for ants in myrmecochory, we assert that social immune behavioral defenses (such as grooming or redispersal of seeds after elaiosome consumption) help ants mitigate this risk. By incorporating a microbial third party into this ant-plant interaction, we seek to more fully understand the risks and benefits provided to both partners in this mutualism. We encourage the investigation of third-party influences in reciprocal pairwise interactions to assist in the understanding of the evolution and persistence of mutualisms.",

Recently, the potential importance of herbivores and the interactions of pollinators and herbivores have also been recognized. We studied pollinators, herbivores, and plant phenotypes in four populations of the western wallflower (Erysimum capitatum, Brassicaceae) along an elevational gradient in the Front Range of the Eastern Slope of the Colorado Rocky Mountains in 2005 and 2006. Several phenotypic characters varied among populations over a small spatial scale (<50km), and plants were visited by a wide variety of pollinators and herbivores. E. capitatum plants in these populations were primarily pollinated by bees, pollen beetles, and flies. The most common types of pollinating visitors differed among populations. Ants were the most common visitors in all populations. They removed nectar from the base of flowers, occasionally attacked bees, and rarely came into contact with stigmas. Many other herbivores fed on flowers and buds of E. capitatum. Some of these damaged petals, potentially making plants less attractive to pollinators. Gall midge larvae (Cecidomyiidae) formed galls from flower buds and typically prevented flowers from opening. Both herbivores and pollinators were different from year to year and from population to population. We argue that the potential for local adaptation to pollinators and herbivores exists in Erysimum capitatum.",

The purpose of this study was to determine how the presence of aphids, ants, and pest individuals interact within canola (syn. oilseed rape) fields. Using seasonal data from canola fields, the relationships among ants, aphids and pest individuals were determined, along with the use of PCR techniques in order to amplify aphid DNA and confirm food web links on predators who consume aphids. We determined that aphid presence positively influences the number of ants and predators in a community, and diminishing aphid populations over the growing season were associated with declines in both ants and predators. These reduced populations of predators and aphids may have provided the opportunity for a key pest, Pieris rapae to build populations as the season ensued. This research suggests that complex interactions among herbivores and shared predators contribute to pest outbreaks.

    "abstract": "Species that are involved in multitrophic interactions are affected by the trophic levels that are above and below them in both indirect and direct ways. In this experiment, interactions among ants (Formica montana Wheeler; Hymenoptera: Formicidae), aphids (Myzus persicae [Sulzer]; Hemiptera: Aphididae), lepidopteran eggs (Pieris rapae [L.]; Lepidoptera: Pieridae), and lady beetles (Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were examined on canola (Brassica napus L.; Brassicales: Brassicaceae) to determine whether aphids mediate interactions between ants and eggs and if aphid-tending ants will protect these species from predation by the lady beetles. The first trial examined how ant attendance affected aphid and egg survival over 72 h when these herbivores were present on their own or in combination. The second trial examined these same interactions when a lady beetle was included in the system. Ants consumed significantly more aphids when this prey was offered alone than when eggs were offered alongside. When lady beetles were present, ants did not consume aphids. Ants and lady beetles consumed nearly all of the eggs regardless of whether aphids were present or not. When a lady beetle was absent, ant attendance increased significantly, but only when eggs and aphids were present in the system together. Ants visited the aphids less frequently when a lady beetle was present in the system, possibly due to increased competition. This trend was consistent over time in all treatments. All of this suggests that ants can be an important source of pest management of other herbivores (and even of the aphids that they are attending) but that these interactions are mediated by whether an additional predator is present within the system.

I measured dispersal distances and analyzed seedling recruitment and seedling size for ant-planted CH and CL seeds, a protocol made possible by the fact that the seed coat of C. micans can be indelibly marked and remains attached to the base of the seedling for a few months. Seeds were taken by ants from experimental depots placed in natural conditions. In a second experiment, I planted CH and CL seeds in gap and understory sites to determine the effects of seed type and light on germination percentage, date of emergence, and seed and seedling survivorship. Ant-planted CH and CL seedlings did not differ in dispersal distance. CH and CL seeds did not differ significantly in recruitment probability and seedling size in either experiment. However, for the ant-planted seedlings, CH recruitment was higher in the understory than in the gap, while CL recruitment was uniform across light environments. In conclusion, I found a difference in the establishment success of CH and CL seeds in this understory herb, only after dispersal by ants in field conditions.",

Experiments and observations were performed in two Amazonian terra firme forest sites. Twenty-two ant species were recorded visiting the EFNs of P. coccinea. Camponotus aff. blandus was the most frequent and subordinate among the EFN-visiting ant species, accounting for 20%% of the ant attacks on simulated herbivores (termites) and 50%% on butterflies. Both the number of ant individuals and the number of species were positively correlated with the combined number of buds and flowers of P. coccinea. Moreover, ant protection behaviour against termites was stronger on flowers than on leaves. Finally, seed set almost doubled among fruits originating from ant-visited flowers as compared to flowers from which ants were artificially excluded. Our results suggest a protective role of ants for flowers of P. coccinea against both herbivores and nectar thieves, improving plant reproductive success.",

Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the Euphorbiaceae species in the semi-arid Caatinga vegetation region of northeastern Brazil, and show that myrmecochory strongly associates with small plant stature, even after controlling for seed size. The association of myrmecochory with small stature suggests that the primary benefit to plants concerns distance of dispersal, which reduces parental and sibling competition.          *[No ant species mentioned in this publication.]",

Despite climatic restrictions, plant pollination in Caatinga is very specialized, involving 13 different systems & a high percentage of pollination by vertebrates.  Abiotic seed dispersal prevails, but the Caatinga is a global hotspot for myrmecochory, with more than 100 woody species depending on ants for seed dispersal.  Extrafloral nectary-bearing plants also represent a conspicuous feature of the Caatinga flora (15% of woody species & 40% of individuals at the local scale), with protection against herbivores provided by a diverse ant community.  Leaf-cutting ants (LCAs) & exotic goats represent the most voracious herbivores (the leaf-cutting ant herbivory rate is 20% of leaves in their foraging areas).  It has already been demonstrated that human disturbances can reduce the diversity of pollination systems & high-quality ant dispersal services in the Caatinga.  On the other hand, leaf-cutting ant colony density usually increases along roads & other human-disturbed habitats, with increments in the herbivory rate due to the proliferation of palatable plants (e.g., native Euphorbiaceae & weeds).  As climate & land use changes proceed, a substantial proportion of the Caatinga plant-animal interactions are likely to be disrupted or even become extinct, with unanticipated impacts on biodiversity persistence & sustainability in this biologically unique region.]          *[Cephalotes inaequalis misspelled Cephalothes inaequalis.]",

However, a negative effect of disturbance on visitation by attendant ants could prevent EFN-bearing plants from acting as disturbance winners. Here, we address the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on the abundance of EFN-bearing plants and their interactions with attendant ants in Caatinga vegetation of northeastern Brazil. We recorded the abundance of EFN-bearing plants, proportion of plants visited by ants and composition of ant attendant species at 24 sites varying in levels of disturbance. EFN-bearing plants as a whole did not behave as a disturbance winner group. The responses of the 13 species to increasing disturbance were highly variable, with three species declining in abundance (loser species). The richness of ant species attending EFNs did not vary with disturbance, but species composition did. The overall proportion of EFN-bearing plants attended by ants per 5-min period was not affected by disturbance. However, for the three loser species, attendance decreased from about 50 percent with low and moderate disturbance to half that with very high disturbance. We hypothesize that disturbed sites are more stressful for loser species compared with other EFN-bearing plants, with physiological stress resulting in lower production of EFN secretions and reduced attraction of ants. This would make such species double losers, with physiological stress at disturbed sites not only directly influencing their performance but also indirectly affecting it through the disruption of a key mutualism.          *[We observed a total of 14 ant species attending extrafloral nectary-bearing plants, with Camponotus crassus being the most frequentant species attending extrafloral nectaries, representing 81% of all ant-attendance observations.]",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the traditional view of myrmecochory as a highly diffuse interaction between diaspores and a wide range of ant species attracted to their elaiosomes may not be correct. The effectiveness of dispersal varies markedly among ant species, and combined with differential attractiveness of diaspores due to elaiosome size and composition, this raises the potential for myrmecochorous plants to target ant species that offer the highest quality dispersal services. We ask the question: Do particular physical and chemical traits of elaiosomes result in disproportionate removal of Euphorbiaceae diaspores by high-quality disperser ants in Caatinga vegetation of north-eastern Brazil? We offered seeds of five euphorb species that varied in morphological and chemical traits of elaiosomes to seed-dispersing ants. High-quality seed-disperser ants (species of Dinoponera, Ectatomma and Camponotus) were identified as those that rapidly collected and transported diaspores to their nests, often over substantial distances, whereas low-quality disperser ants (primarily species of Pheidole and Solenopsis) typically fed on elaiosomes in situ, and only ever transported diaspores very short distances. Low-quality disperser ants were equally attracted to the elaiosomes of all study species. However, high-quality dispersers showed a strong preference for diaspores with the highest elaiosome mass (and especially proportional mass). As far as we are aware, this is the first study to identify a mechanism of diaspore selection by high-quality ant dispersers based on elaiosome traits under field conditions. Our findings suggest that myrmecochorous plants can preferentially target high-quality seed-disperser ants through the evolution of particular elaiosome traits.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical models on mutualism dynamics predict that partner traits may influence the outcome of mutualistic interactions. However, most empirical data on this issue is restricted to case studies, limiting our ability to reach a more widespread comprehension of the role of partner traits on the dynamic of mutualisms. We investigated how the outcome of protective mutualisms between ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) is influenced by the traits of EFNs and ants feeding on EFNs. We used a meta\u0010analytical approach based on 35 studies investigating the effect of ant attendance on the herbivores and reproductive performance of EFN\u0010bearing plants. We evaluated how variation in the EFN vascularization and location on plants and the ant aggressiveness can modulate the effect of ant attendance on the plants. Both plant and ant traits investigated here drove the outcome of the protective mutualism for EFN\u0010bearing plants. Plants exclusively bearing EFNs near reproductive organs benefited more from ant attendance than plants bearing EFNs on vegetative or vegetative and reproductive organs. Ants had a higher positive impact on the reproductive performance of plants bearing non\u0010vascularized EFNs than plants bearing vascularized EFNs, although their effects on herbivores had been similar in both plant types. Regarding the ant behaviour, plants often attended by more aggressive ant species had a higher reproductive performance than plants often attended by less aggressive ones. Synthesis. Our results highlight that the selective pressures and evolutionary routes in ant\u0010plant protective mutualisms may depend on the pool of traits exhibited by partner species. Although some studies have already reported some impact of species traits on the outcome of ant\u0010plant mutualisms, this is the first time that a generalization about the role of species traits on the net balance of ant attendance was proposed. Due to this generalization, it was possible to advance our knowledge about the evolution of facultative mutualisms by showing that the role of species traits on the mutualistic outcome can vary in intricate ways due to a particular trait combination found among partners in communities where the interactions are embedded in.",

    "abstract": "We compare selected aspects of the biotas of long-isolated islands ranging in size from R\u00c8union to early Pliocene South America, focusing on Madagascar, New Zealand, New Caledonia and the Hawaiian Islands. Although Madagascar and New Zealand were joined to larger land masses less than 90 million years ago, their biotas are overwhelmingly dominated by descendants of colonists from overseas. The size of a long-isolated land mass decisively influences major features of its ecosystem. On smaller islands, extinction is more likely, colonization is rarer, and there are fewer opportunities for diversification. The largest herbivores and the largest carnivores are smaller on smaller islands. Reduced diversity, lower predation pressure and diminished evolutionary innovation reduce the severity of competition on smaller islands: their plants are less well defended against vertebrate herbivores, and their primary productivity is lower, while their animals are longer-lived, less fecund, and have lower basal metabolism than mainland ecological counterparts. Herbivores are most likely to evolve convergently with counterparts on other land masses with predators of similar size and/or efficiency. Thus sloth lemurs converged on tree sloths, Megaladapis on koalas, and moa-nalos on moas and elephant birds. The degree of an island's isolation also affects its ecosystem's characteristics. More isolated islands receive fewer immigrants, so diversity is lower on more isolated islands, especially small islands with high risks of extinction. Fewer mainland immigrants, whose efficiency was tested against a variety of competitors and well-defended prey, reach more isolated islands, so competition is less intense on these islands, and these islands' predators are less efficient. Smaller size and greater isolation therefore make a land mass more invasible. Islands with the fewest predators and the slowest pace of life are most likely to be catastrophically disrupted by mainland invaders. All these phenomena have analogues in human economies. As a rule, economies with higher total production support more intense competition, more innovation, a greater diversity of occupations, a faster pace of life, and greater productivity per capita.

We review the taxonomic, phylogenetic, & biogeographic distribution of myrmecochory in flowering plants.  Myrmecochory is mediated by elaiosomes, i.e., lipid-rich seed appendages that attract ants & serve as rewards for dispersal.  We surveyed the literature for evidence of elaiosomes in angiosperm plants to estimate the global prevalence of myrmecochory.  We then searched the literature for phylogenetic reconstructions to identify myrmecochorous lineages & to estimate the minimum number of independent evolutionary origins of myrmecochory.  We found that myrmecochory is present in at least 11,000 species or 4.5% of all species, in 334 genera or 2.5% of all genera, & in 77 families or 17% of all families of angiosperm plants.  We identified at least 101, but possibly up to 147, independent origins of myrmecochory.  We estimated 3 or more origins in 13 families & found that at least half the genera are myrmecochorous in 10 families.  Most myrmecochorous lineages were Australian, South African, or northern temperate (Holarctic).  A mapping of families containing myrmecochorous genera on a dated angiosperm supertree showed that myrmecochory has evolved in most of the major angiosperm lineages & that it is more frequent in younger families (crown group age less than 80 million years) than in older ones.  We suggest that the relatively low physiological & energetic costs of producing an elaiosome & the consistent selective benefits of myrmecochory (dispersal, protection from seed predators & fire, safe & nutrient-rich microsites) explain the numerous evolutionary & developmental origins of myrmecochory in angiosperm plants.  We propose that elaiosomes thus provide one of the most dramatic examples of convergent evolution in biology.]",

In all populations North of the river, many polygynous colonies are observed, while mostly monogynous ones are observed South of the river.

We investigated, using microsatellite markers, whether the river constituted a genetic barrier thus explaining the rupture in social structure.  For both plant & ant, the river did not appear to be an obstacle.  These observations suggest that the distribution of social structure in the ant is not explained by physical obstacles.

Ant-plant mutualisms are widespread in the tropics. Within Leonardoxa africana, two subspecies present contrasting defences against herbivores. Young leaves of subsp. africana are defended by mutualistic ants, whereas subsp. gracilicaulis satiates herbivores by synchronized leaf production. subsp. africana possesses hollow internodes and many large foliar nectaries, housing and feeding ants. We detected no genetic introgression between the two subspecies in the contact zone between them. F1 hybrids were present. They were intermediate in phenotype, expressing reduced, nonfunctional but costly myrmecophilic traits. However, they suffered more herbivory than their parents. Hybrids remained small, failing to reach reproductive size, probably due to their maladapted defiance phenotype. Hence, there could be a direct link between adaptation to mutualism and reproductive isolation: biotic interactions could be a driver of tropical diversity.",

The mean volumes of water, fine particulate organic matter and detritus in C. femoratus-associated bromeliads were three to five times higher than in P. goeldii-associated bromeliads. Moreover, the highest invertebrate diversity and leaf delta-15N values were found in C. femoratus-associated bromeliads.

By combining a study of plant morphology and physiology associated with aquatic insect biology, we demonstrate that the ant species influences the leaf structure of the bromeliad, the structure of the aquatic community in its tank, and nutrient assimilation by the leaves. Based on nitrogen and nitrogen stable isotope measurements of the A. mertensii leaves, the leaf litter inside of the tank and the root-embedded carton nest, we discuss the potential sources of available nitrogen for the plant based on the ant partner. We demonstrate the existence of a complex ant-plant interaction that subsequently affects the biodiversity of a broader range of organisms that are themselves likely to influence nutrient assimilation by the A. mertensii leaves in a kind of plant-invertebrate-plant feedback loop.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims: Determining the sources of variation in floral morphology is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying Angiosperm evolution. The selection of floral and reproductive traits is influenced by the plant's abiotic environment, florivores and pollinators. However, evidence that variations in floral traits result from mutualistic interactions with insects other than pollinators is lacking in the published literature and has rarely been investigated. We aimed to determine whether the association with either Camponotus femoratus or Pachycondyla goeldii (both involved in seed dispersal and plant protection) mediates the reproductive traits and allocation of Aechmea mertensii, an obligatory ant-garden tank-bromeliad, differently.  Methods: Floral and reproductive traits were compared between the two A. mertensii ant-gardens. The nitrogen flux from the ants to the bromeliads was investigated through experimental enrichments with stable isotopes (15N).  Key Results: Camponotus femoratus-associated bromeliads produced inflorescences up to four times longer than did P. goeldii-associated bromeliads. Also, the numbers of flowers and fruits were close to four times higher, and the number of seeds and their mass per fruit were close to 1.5 times higher in C. femoratus than in P. goeldii-associated bromeliads. Furthermore, the 15N-enrichment experiment showed that C. femoratus-associated bromeliads received more nitrogen from ants than did P. goeldii-associated bromeliads, with subsequent positive repercussions on floral development. Greater benefits were conferred to A. mertensii by the association with C. femoratus compared with P. goeldii ants.  Conclusions:  We show for the first time that mutualistic associations with ants can result in an enhanced reproductive allocation for the bromeliad A. mertensii. Nevertheless, the strength and direction of the selection of floral and fruit traits change based on the ant species and were not related to light exposure. The different activities and ecological preferences of the ants may play a contrasting role in shaping plant evolution and speciation.",

    "abstract": "The plant Hirtella physophora, the ant Allomerus decemarticulatus and a fungus, Trimmatostroma sp., form a tripartite association. The ants manipulate both the plant trichomes and the fungus to build galleries under the stems of their host plant used to capture prey. In addition to its structural role, the fungus also improves nutrient uptake by the host plant. But it still remains unclear whether the fungus plays an indirect or a direct role in transferring nutrients to the plant. This study aimed to trace the transfer of N from the fungus to the plant\u0019s stem tissue. Optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the presence of fungal hyphae in the stem tissues. Then, a \u03c0uN-labelling experiment was combined with a nanoscale secondary-ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS 50) isotopic imaging approach to trace the movement of added \u03c0uN from the fungus to plant tissues. The TEM images clearly showed hyphae inside the stem tissue in the cellular compartment. Also, fungal hyphae were seen perforating the wall of the parenchyma cell. The \u03c0uN provisioning of the fungus in the galleries resulted in significant enrichment of the \u03c0uN signature of the plant\u0019s leaves 1 d after the \u03c0uN-labelling solution was deposited on the fungus-bearing trap. Finally, NanoSIMS imaging proved that nitrogen was transferred biotrophically from the fungus to the stem tissue. This study provides evidence that the fungi are connected endophytically to an ant-plant system and actively transfer nitrogen from \u03c0uN-labelling solution to the plant's stem tissues. Overall, this study underlines how complex the trophic structure of ant-plant interactions is due to the presence of the fungus and provides insight into the possibly important nutritional aspects and tradeoffs involved in myrmecophyte-ant mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims: Myrmecophytes, or ant-plants, are characterized by their ability to shelter colonies of some ant species in hollow structures, or ant-domatia, that are often formed by hypertrophy of the internal tissue at specific locations (i.e. trunk, branches, thorns and leaf pouches). In Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), the focal species of this study, the ant-domatia consist of leaf pouches formed when the leaf rolls over onto itself to create two spheres at the base of the blade.  Methods: The morphological and anatomical changes through which foliar ant-domatia developed from the laminas are studied for the first time by using fresh and fixed mature leaves from the same H. physophora individuals.  Key: results Ant-domatia were characterized by larger extra-floral nectaries, longer stomatal apertures and lower stomatal density. The anatomical structure of the domatia differed in the parenchymatous tissue where palisade and spongy parenchyma were indistinct; chloroplast density was lower and lignified sclerenchymal fibres were more numerous compared with the lamina. In addition, the domatia were thicker than the lamina, largely because the parenchymatous and epidermal cells were enlarged.  Conclusions: Herein, the morphological and anatomical changes that permit foliar ant-domatia to be defined as a specialized leaf structure are highlighted. Similarities as well as structural modifications in the foliar ant-domatia compared with the lamina are discussed from botanical, functional and mutualistic points of view. These results are also important to understanding the reciprocal evolutionary changes in traits and, thus, the coevolutionary processes occurring in insect-plant mutualisms.",

In this study conducted in French Guiana on Hirtella physophora, Maieta guianensis, and Tococa guianensis, we focused on the formation and development of leaf domatia having different morphological origins. We modeled the timing of the onset of these domatia, then compared their morpho-anatomical structure. Although the ontogenetic development of the domatia differed between species, they developed very early in the plant's ontogeny so that we did not note differences in the timing of the onset of these domatia. For H. physophora seedlings, a transitional leaf forms before the appearance of fully developed domatia, whereas in M. guianensis and T. guianensis the domatia forms abruptly without transitional leaves. Moreover, in all cases, the morpho-anatomical structure of the domatia differed considerably from the lamina. All three species had similar morpho-anatomical characteristics for the domatia, indicating a convergence in their structural and functional characteristics. This convergence between taxonomically distant plant species bearing domatia having different morphological origins could be interpreted as a product of the plant's evolution toward the morphology and anatomy most likely to maximize ant recruitment and long-term residence.",

    "abstract": "1.Plants often rely on external, mutualistic partners to survive and reproduce in resource-limited environments or for protection from enemies. Such interactions, including mycorrhizal symbioses and ant-plant associations, are widespread and play an important role at the ecosystem and community levels. In ant-plant mutualisms, the plants may benefit from both the protection provided by the presence of ants and from the nutrients absorbed from insect debris. However, the role of third partners in plant nutrition, particularly ant-associated fungi, has never before been demonstrated. 2.We investigate this issue in the ant-plant Hirtella physophora. In this model system, Allomerus decemarticulatus ants are involved in two, highly specific interactions: first, with their host plant, and, secondly, with a fungus that they actively manipulate. Moreover, the ants combine both plant trichomes and fungal hyphae to make a trap to capture prey. 3.We empirically demonstrate the existence of a third type of interaction between the fungus and the plant through the use of both experimental enrichments with stable isotopes (15N) and histological approaches. The fungus growing in the galleries plays a role in providing nutrients to the host plant, in addition to the structural role it plays for the ants. Fungus-facilitated nitrogen uptake occurs mainly in old domatia, where abundant hyphae are in close contact with the plant cells. Whether the fungi inside the domatia and those in the galleries are the same is still uncertain. 4.Synthesis.Together, our results show that a fungal partner in an ant-plant mutualism can benefit the plant by improving its nutrient uptake, and they demonstrate the existence of a true tripartite mutualism in this system. Our results add further evidence to the notion that interpretations of some ant-plant symbioses as purely protective mutualisms have overlooked these nutritional aspects.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific competition plays a key role in the organization of ant communities. In ant-plant interactions, individual host plants are usually occupied by a single ant colony, and co-occurring ant species compete for hosts. Here indirect evidence of competition between three dominant ant species that tend aphids on two biennial thistles in northern Patagonia is described, and a novel defensive behavior in temperate ant assemblages is reported.  This study has found that: (i) dominant ant species were not spatially segregated, thus enhancing the probability of fights and invasions of host plants; (ii) ant species did not show preferences for a thistle species or for any plant characteristic, and thus all plants have similar chances of being colonized by all dominant ant species; (iii) the resident ant species remained on the same plant during the whole plant life cycle, monopolizing plant resources (aphids); and (iv) all dominant species, whose nests are on the ground, assigned some ants to stay on the host plant during the night, when the low temperatures typical of this temperate environment greatly reduce foraging activities. When these 'nocturnal guards' were experimentally removed from the host plant, other ants from the same colony rapidly appeared showing aggressive behaviors.  Taking all these findings together, it is suggested that interspecific competition influences the distribution of ants on their host plants and involves nocturnal defensive behaviors despite unfavorable thermal conditions. This illustrates how habitat features, such as the short life cycle of thistles and the low night-time temperatures that reduce ant foraging and thus make plants more vulnerable to invasion, might affect the distribution and behavior of ants.",

    "abstract": "Myrmecophytic Piper spp. were re-examined in view of what has become a common expectation in studies of mutualistic ant-plant associations: overtly aggressive behavioral traits in ants that function in anti-herbivore defense. Piper plants provide food and shelter for the Pheidole ant inhabitants. The ants, small and 'sluggish', were previously thought to serve in nutrient procurement for the plant even though their foraging is probably restricted to the plant surface and most of the ants' food is produced by the plant itself. An alternative hypothesis, that Pheidole ants function in anti-herbivore defense by disrupting herbivores as eggs or early instars occurring on Piper foliage, was tested using the follwing lines of reasoning: 1) If the youngest, tender leaves are more vulnerable to herbivore attack, or simply more valuable to the plant, then ants may 'patrol' these leaves preferentially. More ants were found on young leaves (\u00af=2,00 ants/leaf) than on mature leaves (\u00af=0,51.  2) If the ants are functioning in anti-herbivore defense, herbivory should be lower on occupied plants than on plants without ants. Estimates of mean percent foliovore damage per sapling showed that for samples with similar average heights (and presumably, ages), the unoccupied plants had significantly greater damage. A comparison of newest leaves showed a significant trend for damage to decrease with increased ant activity. 3) If ants are attacking herbivores at early stages of development, baiting with eggs should demonstrate this activity. Over 75% of all egg baits on young and mature leaves were taken up by an ant during observation periods of 30 or 60 min. Baits were found significantly faster on young than on mature leaves. In over half of the baiting trials, the egg was taken to the edge of the leaf and dropped to the ground rather than sequestered as  a nutrient source. These data suggest that Pheidole inhabiting Piper plants are important in plant defense from herbivores and that adherance to a classical notion of aggression in similar studies might bias the initial question-asking stages of an investigation.",

    "abstract": "Extract (in part): (...) \u00a5By the time young Piper trees have just 2 or 3 full-sized leaves, one of the leaf bases -hollow swellings between the branch and the leaf itself- usually contains a Pheidole queen. She colonizes a Piper sapling by chewing an entrance hole and laying eggs inside the leaf base. When her eggs first hatch into larvae, she and the young occupy one of the leaf bases, but as the colony grows, the worker ants gradually hollow out the stem pith tissue, and the entire plant becomes a domicile. This lodge is also a source of food; the inside surface of the expanded leaf bases produces single-celled, opalescent food bodies that look like dust lining the chamber walls. Ants pluck these oil- and protein- rich morsels from the walls and feed them to the fat, pale larvae, (....)  The late ecologist Stephen Risch and phytochemist Fred Rickson found that, unlike other ant plants, which produce ant food even after the ant colonies are removed, Piper ant plants manufacture food bodies only when Pheidole ants are in residence. (...) Foraging Pheidole ants, then, appear to take up a variety of particles, such as minute spores, fragments of algae, and moth scales, and carry them into their plant in their crop.... (...) Eventually, these nutrients may fertilize, and thus benefit, the ant plant. (...) Ant-occupied plants had a mean level of 12 to 15 % of leaf area removed by herbivores, while plants without ants suffered typical leaf damage of 35 to 40 %.  (...) Does leaf damage reduce the Piper plant\u00a5s ability to grow and reproduce? Curiously, all my efforts to harm plants by removing leaves (up to 50 % of each leaf on all test trees for 5 years) have failed. (...) Whereas plants with ant colonies that have repeatedly had parts of leaves removed still grow and produce seeds, plants from which ants have been excluded produce very few flowers. This decline is not due to leaf-feeding insects; it is caused by an invader. The weevil Ambates melanops attacks a large portion of unoccupied plants and kills the stem by boring it from within. These weevils rarely manage to kill a stem when plants have ant custodians. (...) The (Phyllobaenus) beetles have broken the code by which Pheidole ants stimulate the plants to produce food. By exploiting the peaceful partnership of ants and plant, the beetles qualify as parasites on the mutualism.",

    "abstract": "This study tests experimentally the hypothesis that Pheidole bicornis ants increase the fitness of Piper ant\u0010plants (Piperaceae) in Costa Rican forests. In two experiments with naturally occurring Piper ant\u0010plants, ~50 individuals were randomly selected and maintained either as controls (with ants) or as ant\u0010exclusion plants (without ants) for 2 yr. Leaf replacement rates and seed production, as measures of relative plant vigor and reproductive potential, were significantly greater in control plants with intact ant colonies than in plants from which ant colonies were experimentally excluded by periodical treatment with dilute insecticide. A series of experiments was designed to assess the relative contribution of antiherbivore defense, nutrient procurement, and antipathogen defense as potential mutualistic functions of the ants. To assess the fitness effects of antiherbivore defense, leaf replacement rates and seed production were measured on plants to which artificial folivory was applied over a 2\u0010yr period (33% of each leaf blade removed), and stem\u0010boring weevil damage was monitored on plants with and without ants. Nutrient procurement by ants was estimated quantitatively, and net leaf production was monitored experimentally on control plants (with ants), on plants without ants, and on nutrient\u0010enriched plants with ants (microquantities of fertilizer added to lower stem). Epiphyll loads, phylloplane spore densities, and disease incidence were compared on experimental plants with and without ant colonies. The results indicate that folivory, the classical parameter measured in ant\u0010plant studies, was not related to differences in fitness in Piper ant\u0010plants; instead, ant disruption of stem\u0010borers and ant foraging on inflorescences to reduce fungal invasion were identified as probable mechanisms by which ants conferred an average fitness advantage of at least 60 and 10%, respectively, in the 2nd yr of the comparison. Although neither antifolivore defense nor nutrient provisioning by ants appeared to benefit Piper plants, they may contribute synergistically or may operate on temporal or spatial scales not included in the study. For example, nutrient provisioning may allow Piper ant\u0010plant species to occupy and compete favorably in poor\u0010soil habitats not evaluated in these experiments.",

In Papua New Guinea, the euphorb Endospermum labios is commonly inhabited by Camponotus quadriceps ants that are easily alarmed, recruit effectively, and bite intruders on the host plant. Plants that lack Camponotus often have other resident ant species. We compared the size, herbivore load, herbivory level, frequency of plants supporting vines, and degree of ant defense on E. labios with different ant inhabitants growing intermixed in disturbed forest. A glabrous morph of this tree had distinctly larger colonies of Camponotus, was dramatically larger on average, and suffered very little herbivore damage compared to pubescent morphs even though the morphs appeared to be equally preferred by foundress ants for colony initiation and as food by uraniid caterpillars. Herbivores on E. labios escaped ant defenses by exploiting plants that lacked Camponotus colonies. We hypothesize that colony initiation was less successful in the pubescent morphs in part because of a parasite fly that attacks foundress ants.",

    "abstract": "Tropical rain forests, some of the most diverse natural communities, have been characterized either as inherently stable or as extremely fragile. Theoretically, complex food webs allow for alternative pathways and overlapping functions within and among trophic levels, such that cascading effects are buffered and perturbation is resisted. On the other hand, strong interdependence among species and trophic levels in these same systems can make them vulnerable to perturbation. To assess the ability of a tropical rain forest community to resist perturbation or to amplify perturbation through trophic cascades, we measured changes in overall vegetative cover and species richness of understory plants in response to the experimental addition of a top predator beetle. In August 2000, 30 randomly located patches of naturally occurring Piper cenocladum shrubs were found at sites with variable soil quality and light availability, and top predator addition treatments were randomly assigned to half the patches. Using an 8\u0010m2 subplot within each P. cenocladum patch, we estimated (nondestructively) vegetative cover of understory plants for nine months and measured herbivore damage, plant longevity and plant species richness for ~1.5 years. For all understory species in our subplots, vegetative cover and total numbers of leaves declined significantly more in predator addition patches than in control patches. Understory cover also declined significantly more on poor soils than on rich soils. Mortality of small plants was high overall, but longevity was significantly greater in control patches than in patches with top predators. Herbivore damage was lowest, plant establishment highest, and the accumulation of new plant species highest in control plots on rich soils. The cumulative effect of top predators interacted with plant resources, such that plant species richness was suppressed when beetles were present in understory communities on rich soils. Patterns of herbivore damage suggest that trophic cascades from apex predators through ant predators to herbivores altered the structure of understory vegetation. The presence of indirect effects supports the characterization of rain forests as vulnerable ecosystems whose integrity may be threatened by the slow erosion of complex tight interactions among species.",

    "abstract": "We describe the role of leaf-litter ants (Pheidole spp.) in the seed bank dynamics of several small-seeded shrubs in a Costa Rican lowland rain forest. Three ants harvest seeds from frugivore feces and cache them in their nests in partially decomposed twigs. From 24 to 38% of the colonies (depending on ant species) contain cached seeds and 25-32% have seeds on refuse piles. Experiments with captive colonies of Pheidole nebulosa and P. nigricula demonstrated that ~6% of harvested Miconia nervosa and M. centrodesma seeds and deposited on refuse piles. Because seeds generally retain viability longer than the nest twig remains intact, harvested seeds are not trapped inside twigs. Experimental plantings of 4-d-old Miconia nervosa seedling on two types of substrate (ant refuse pile vs. topsoil) under two light levels (equivalent to small and large clearings) demonstrated that seedlings grew faster and survived better on refuse piles under light levels typical of small clearings. Light levels typical of large gaps are not necessarily advantageous for establishment of understory rain forest plants. These results illustrate the dynamic nature of a tropical soil seed band and the complexity of plant-animal interactions that occur there. Ants are simultaneously antagonistic and mutualistic towards seeds, killing most but significantly benefiting some. This interaction is extremely common (Pheidole density >300 individuals/m2) and likely influences plant recruitment patterns. Our results challenge the generalizations that small seeds are largely protected from predation because of their size, that post-dispersal seed harvesting is equivalent to seed predation, that competition among seedings from a frugivore defecation is common, and that small seeds accumulated over long periods of time in the seed bank. We hypothesize that differential harvesting treatment of seeds by ant species may be a mechanism underlying community-level patterns of regeneration in small-seeded plants. Also, the incidental benefits to uneaten seeds deposited on refuse piles provide additional evidence that myrmecochory evolved in plants that strengthened rare but consistent benefits of being harvested by \"granivorous\" ants.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of plant-pollinator interactions by invasive predators is poorly understood but may pose a critical threat for native ecosystems. In a multiyear field experiment in Hawai'i, we suppressed abundances of globally invasive predators and then observed insect visitation to flowers of six native plant species. Three plant species are federally endangered (Haplostachys haplostachya, Silene lanceolata, Tetramolopium arenarium) and three are common throughout their range (Bidens menziesii, Dubautia linearis, Sida fallax). Insect visitors were primarily generalist pollinators, including taxa that occur worldwide such as solitary bees (e.g., Lasioglossum impavidum), social bees (e.g., Apis mellifera), and syrphid flies (e.g., Allograpta exotica). We found that suppressing invasive rats (Rattus rattus), mice (Mus musculus), ants (Linepithema humile, Tapinoma melanocephalum), and yellowjacket wasps (Vespula pensylvanica) had positive effects on pollinator visitation to plants in 16 of 19 significant predator-pollinator-plant interactions. We found only positive effects of suppressing rats and ants, and both positive and negative effects of suppressing mice and yellowjacket wasps, on the frequency of interactions between pollinators and plants. Model results predicted that predator eradication could increase the frequency of insect visitation to flowering species, in some cases by more than 90%. Previous results from the system showed that these flowering species produced significantly more seed when flowers were allowed to outcross than when flowers were bagged to exclude pollinators, indicating limited autogamy. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of suppression or eradication of invasive rodents, ants, and yellowjackets to reverse pollination disruption, particularly in locations with high numbers of at\u0010risk plant species or already imperiled pollinator populations.

    "abstract": "Ants patrol foliage and exert a strong selective pressure on herbivorous insects, being their primary predators. As ants are chemically oriented, some organisms that interact with them (myrmecophiles) use chemical strategies mediated by their cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to deal with ants. Thus, a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of the mutualistic interactions between myrmecophiles and ants depends on the accurate recognition of these chemical strategies. Few studies have examined whether treehoppers may use an additional strategy called chemical camouflage to reduce ant aggression, and none considered highly polyphagous pest insects. We analyzed whether the chemical similarity of the CHC profiles of three host plants from three plant families (Fabaceae, Malvaceae, and Moraceae) and the facultative myrmecophilous honeydew-producing treehopper Aetalion reticulatum (Hemiptera: Aetalionidae), a pest of citrus plants, may play a role as a proximate mechanism serving as a protection against ant attacks on plants. We found a high similarity (>80%) between the CHCs of the treehoppers and two of their host plants. The treehoppers acquire CHCs through their diet, and the chemical similarity varies according to host plant. Chemical camouflage on host plants plays a role in the interaction of treehoppers with their ant mutualistic partners.           *[No specific ants mentioned.]",

    "abstract": "This project sought to characterize plant defense investment in the castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), an exotic myrmecophyte in southern California, with respect to life history strategies. Experimental evidence suggests that exotic myrmecophytes can form mutually beneficial associations with exotic ants regardless of the differences in shared evolutionary histories. Castor bean plant investment in defense was evaluated by measuring the area on extra-floral nectary (EFN) glands. Life history strategies may change with respect to plant size and was therefore evaluated in terms of basal stem diameter (<50mm). We hypothesized that smaller and younger castor bean plants would have bigger EFN glands than larger and older plants. We found that EFN gland size was not correlated to castor bean class size. This suggests that in southern California, biotic plant defense is not optimized in castor bean plants. As an r-selected species, the castor bean plant compromises investment in plant defense favoring investment in growth and early reproduction.          *[In southern California, the castor bean plant attracts Argentine ants (Linepithema humile Mayr), an ant species native to South America.]",

    "abstract": "Rattan is an important climbing palm taxon in Malaysian tropical rain forests. Many rattan species have unique structures directly associated with certain ant species. In this study, four rattan species (Daemonorops lewisiana, Calamus castaneus, Daemonorops geniculata and Korthalsia scortechinii) were inspected and documented in a field survey concerning their relationships with several ant species. We noticed that two rattan species (D. lewisiana and C. castaneus) were more likely to be associated with ants compared to their neighbouring rattan (Plectomia griffithii). However, D. lewisiana and C. castaneus did not directly provide shelters for ant colonies, but possessed unique structures: upward-pointing spines and funnel-shaped leaves, which are equipped to collect more litter than P. griffithii. To test our litter collecting hypothesis, we measured the inclination of spines from the stem. Our results showed the presence of ant colonies in the litter-collecting rattans (D. lewisiana and C. castaneus), which was significantly higher compared to a non-litter-collecting rattan (P. griffithii). We propose a complex and novel type of adaptation (litter-collection and provision of nesting materials) for rattans, which promotes interactions between the rattan and ants through the arrangements of leaves, leaflets, and spines. In return, the rattan may benefit from ants' services, such as protection, nutrient enhancement, and pollination.",

To date, symbiont communities of most aphid species are still poorly characterized, especially for the social aphids. In this study, high-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was used to assess the bacterial communities of the social aphid Pseudoregma bambucicola, and the differences in bacterial diversity with respect to ant attendance and time series were also assessed. We found that the diversity of symbionts in P. bambucicola was low and three dominant symbionts (Buchnera, Pectobacterium and Wolbachia) were stably coexisting. Pectobacterium may help P. bambucicola feed on the hard bamboo stems, and genetic distance analysis suggests that the Pectobacterium in P. bambucicola may be a new symbiont species. Wolbachia may be associated with the transition of reproduction mode or has a nutritional role in P. bambucicola. Statistical tests on the diversity of bacterial communities in P. bambucicola suggest that aphid populations attended by ants usually have a significantly higher evenness than populations without ant attendance but there was no significant difference among aphid populations from different seasons.",

A survey of ant communities found in Costa Rican Cecropia trees revealed a community of Azteca species obligately associated with Cecropia, and a diverse assemblage of non-obligate ants in a variety of genera. High occupation rates of Cecropia saplings and trees, and presence of many incipient colonies in saplings vs single colonies in trees, suggest that Cecropia are a limiting resource for which ants compete. Obligate Azteca appeared competitively superior to non-obligate ants, since non-obligate ants were never found dominating mature trees. Competitive relationships between obligate Azteca species had a parapatric distribution, the zone of parapatry co-occuring with a similar zone of parapatry between two Cecropia species. At the boundary, the Azteca species were not host specific. Possible factors influencing the outcome of competition between ants for Cecropia trees include queen and worker behavior, priority effects, partial hostplant specialization, and habitat specialization. Explanation of current distributions may require knowledge of historical factors and stochastic effects.",

As previously reported in many studies on plant-herbivore interactions, ant-plant relationships are also asymmetric; plants had a larger impact on herbivore dynamics than vice versa. However, the asymmetry did not refer to population dynamics but rather to animal foraging strategies. Ants did not exert a significant influence on vegetation dynamics in terms of plant abundance. The main constraints underlying vegetation change were self-regulation and rainfall. In contrast, the structural characteristics and abundance of vegetation had a significant impact on several important features of food harvesting by ants. This influence was not only associated with their feeding requirements but also with their foraging activities.",

    "abstract": "Facilitation by nurse plants increases understorey diversity and supports ecological communities. In turn, biodiversity shapes ecological networks and enhances ecosystem functioning. However, whether and how facilitation and increased biodiversity jointly influence community structure and ecosystem functioning remains unclear. We performed a field experiment disentangling the relative contribution of nurse plants and increasing understorey plant diversity in driving pollination interactions. Both the presence of nurse shrubs and increased understorey plant diversity increased pollinator diversity and visitation rates. While nurse and understorey diversity effects on pollinator visitation rates did not interact, the effects of increasing understorey plant diversity on pollinator diversity were stronger in the absence than in the presence of shrubs, meaning that nurse shrubs attenuated the effects of high understorey diversity and buffered the effects of low understorey diversity. We also found positive complementarity effects among understorey species as well as complementarity between nurse plants and understorey species at high diversity. Results also indicate negative selection effects, suggesting that species with generally few pollinators benefit the most in the polyculture while a species (possibly the nurse plant) with generally lots of pollinators does not. The corresponding changes in pollination networks with the experimental treatments were due to both changes in the frequency of visits and turnover in pollinator community composition. Synthesis. Plant-plant facilitative systems, where a nurse plant increases understorey plant diversity, are common in stressful environments. Here, we show that these facilitative systems positively influence mutualistic interactions with pollinators via both direct nurse effects and indirect positive effects of increasing plant diversity. Conserving and supporting nurse plant systems is crucial not only for maintaining plant diversity but also for supporting ecosystem functions and services.          *[2 species of ants listed in SI.]",

Plants can provide resources to ants through the production of extrafloral nectaries. In exchange, ants can fertilise plants through their nutrient\u0010 and microbe\u0010rich refuse. 2. Here, we test a potential facultative mutualism between the carton\u0010nesting canopy ant, Azteca trigona, and their host trees. Through observational and experimental approaches, this study documents how nutrient transfer provides a basis for this beneficial ant-plant relationship. 3. In a greenhouse experiment, fertilisation with sterilised refuse (i.e. nutrients only) increased seedling growth three\u0010fold, while the refuse with its natural microbial community increased growth 11\u0010fold. 4. Total root density was doubled in refuse piles compared with the surrounding area in situ. On average, refuse provides host trees and the surrounding plant community with access to a > 800% increase in N, P and K relative to leaf litter. 5. Azteca trigona preferentially nests in trees with extrafloral nectaries and on large, longer\u0010lived tree species. 6. Given the nutrient\u0010poor nature of the Neotropics, host trees probably experience significant benefits from refuse fertilisation. Conversely, A. trigona benefit from long\u0010term stable structural support for nests and access to nutrient\u0010rich extrafloral nectaries. Without clear costs to either A. trigona or host trees, it is proposed that these positive interactions are preliminary evidence of a facultative mutualism.",

    "abstract": "1. Ant-plant mutualisms have been the focus of considerable empirical research, but few studies have investigated how introduced ants affect these interactions. Using 2 years of survey data, this study examines how the introduced Argentine ant [Linepithema humile (Mayr)] differs from native ants with respect to its ability to protect the extrafloral nectary-bearing coast barrel cactus (Ferocactus viridescens) in Southern California.  2. Eighteen native ant species visited cacti in uninvaded areas, but cacti in invaded areas were primarily visited by the Argentine ant. The main herbivore of the coast barrel cactus present at the study sites is a leaf-footed bug (Narnia wilsoni).  3. Herbivore presence (the fraction of surveys in which leaf-footed bugs were present on individual cacti) was negatively related to ant presence (the fraction of surveys in which ants were present on individual cacti). Compared with cacti in uninvaded areas, those in invaded areas were less likely to have herbivores and when they did had them less often.  4. Seed mass was negatively related to herbivore presence, and this relationship did not differ for cacti in invaded areas versus those in uninvaded areas.  5. Although the Argentine ant might provide superior protection from herbivores, invasion-induced reductions in ant mutualist diversity could potentially compromise plant reproduction. The cumulative number of ant species on individual cacti over time was lower in invaded areas and was associated with a shortened seasonal duration of ant protection and reduced seed mass. These results support the hypothesis that multiple partners may enhance mutualism benefits.",

While species of the genus Pogonomyrmex have been studied in detail as seed predators, their impact on seed abundance in the soil has not yet been explored in sufficient depth. We studied the impact of the harvesting activities of the ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus on seed abundance in the soil of the Zapotitl\u00b7n valley, Mexico. We found that P. barbatus activity significantly impacts the abundance of seeds in the soil, which is lower in the sites where P. barbatus forages than it is in sites with no recorded foraging. We also found that P. barbatus distributes intact seeds of three tree species, two of which are nurse plants, and could consequently be promoting the establishment of these species. Using tools derived from graph theory, we observed that the ant-seed interactions exhibit a nested pattern; where more depredated seed species seem to be the more spatially abundant in the environment. This study illustrates the complex foraging ecology of the harvester ant P. barbatus and elucidates its effect on the soil seed bank in a semi-arid environment.",

Since the spatial and temporal distribution of animals and plants is unequal, their pairwise interactions are also expected to vary or rewire, generating dissimilarities among species interaction networks. In this study, we evaluated the structure of ant-plant interaction networks and described its dissimilarities by assessing species and the turnover of their interactions between day and night periods across two plant physiognomies in a semiarid Neotropical environment of central Mexico. We found that even though the emergent nested structure of networks remains invariant, the great majority of ant-plant interactions are reassembled in less than one day. Moreover, we observed that, between day-night periods, the interaction turnover was mainly driven by rewiring of interactions while, between plant physiognomies, this was generated by both interaction rewiring and species turnover. We postulate that interaction rewiring across the studied habitats could be influenced by the turnover of the central core of highly interacting species. Furthermore, we highlight that both interaction rewiring and species turnover shape ant-plant interactions turnover over day-night periods and plant physiognomies.",

We recorded 5 diferent species, whose diversity & abundance varied through time (diurnal species: Camponotus rubrithorax, Pseudomyrmex major) (nocturnal species: C. atriceps, C. festinatus, Crematogaster sp).  The abundance of ants foraging on the cactus was higher during the morning than during nights.  However during the nights, ants visited the extrafloral nectaries with more frequency.  We found that in the 2 schedules the number of ants foraging on the cactus, is related to the number of active extrafloral nectaries.  The abundance of ants may be higher in the morning because the surface of the cacti provides a substrate under less extreme conditions than the soil.  Less diurnal activity of ants, could indicate a strategy to avoid solar radiation.  We found dependence between the abundance of ants & the number of extrafloral nectaries possibly due to quality & quantity of available resource.  Regardless of the quality of extrafloral nectar, the observed variation of foraging activity between schedules might be because, some species of ants can be dominants with respect to the others & tend to monopolize this resource.]",

    "abstract": "Biotic interactions play an important role in shaping species geographic distributions and diversity patterns. However, the role of mutualistic interactions in shaping global plant diversity patterns remains poorly understood, particularly with respect to interactions with invertebrates. It is unclear how the nature of different mutualisms interacts with abiotic drivers and affects the distribution of mutualistic organisms. Here, we present a global\u0010scale biogeographic analysis of three distinct ant\u0010plant mutualisms, differentiating between plants bearing domatia, extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), and elaiosomes, based on comprehensive geographic distributions of ~ 19 000 flowering plants and ~ 13 000 ant species. Domatia and extrafloral nectaries involve indirect plant defences provided by ants, while elaiosomes attract ants to disperse seeds. Our results reveal distinct biogeographic patterns of different ant\u0010plant mutualisms, with domatium\u0010 and EFN\u0010bearing plant diversity decreasing sharply from the equator towards the poles, while elaiosome\u0010bearing plants prevail at mid\u0010latitudes. Present climate, especially mean annual temperature and precipitation, emerge as the strongest predictors of ant\u0010associated plant diversity. In hot and moist regions, typically the tropics, the representation of EFN\u0010bearing plants increases with the proportion of potential ant partners while domatium\u0010bearing plants show no correlation with ants. In dry regions, plants with elaiosomes are strongly linked to interacting ant seed dispersers. Our results suggest that ants in combination with climate drive the spatial variation of plants bearing domatia, extrafloral nectaries, and elaiosomes, highlighting the importance of mutualistic interactions for understanding plant biogeography.          *[in suppl.

    "abstract": "The presence of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) attracts predators and parasitoids, and protects the plant against herbivorous insects. By improving plant defences, EFNs reduce the fitness of herbivores. The use of similar host plants with no EFNs or adaptations in response to predators and parasitoids may enhance herbivore fitness. In this context, we studied the feeding habit (on leaves or on unripe seeds inside the pods) of larvae of the specialist moth Utetheisa ornatrix in two Crotalaria host plant species in which EFNs are present (C. micans) or absent (C. paulina). We hypothesized that the moths\u0019 feeding habit was influenced by its natural enemies via their presence on EFNs. In C. micans, we found more larvae feeding inside the pods rather than on the leaves, while in C. paulina, larvae were found in both parts of the plant. There was greater activity of natural enemies in C. micans than in C. paulina. The moth sequesters enough pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PAs) to defend against predators in the leaves and seeds of C. paulina, but only in seeds of C. micans. Therefore, a change in the feeding habit in U. ornatrix larvae is a plastic response that depends on whether EFNs are present or not, or whether PA concentrations are low or high. This change does not affect overall moth performance. However, other factors, such as pod hardness, predation by organisms other than those visiting EFNs or even parasitoids cannot be ruled out as being responsible for the change in feeding habit. To date, both the EFNs and PAs in Crotalaria species are a parsimonious explanation of how larvae of U. ornatrix use different species of Crotalaria for feeding.",

Castration led to a higher plant growth rate, signalling a novel case of gigantism induced by parasitic castration.  On the other hand, completely castrated plants produced smaller nesting & food resources (i.e. leaf pouches & extra floral nectaries).  Since the number of worker larvae is correlated to the volume of the leaf pouches, such a decrease in the investment in myrmecophytic traits demonstrates for the first time the existence of inducible retaliation mechanisms against too virulent castrating ants.  Over time, this mechanism promotes an intermediate level of castration and enhances the stability of the mutualistic relationship by providing the ants with more living space, while allowing the plant to reproduce.]",

    "abstract": "In theory, mutualisms are intrinsically unstable, and the search for the maximum profit at the minimum cost should lead every mutualist to become a parasite. From an empirical point of view, mutualisms are ubiquitous and of major importance to ecosystems, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that enhance the maintenance of such relationships. We focused on the obligatory myrmecophytic association between the Neotropical plant Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae) and the ant Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae). The plant shelters the ants in leaf pouches in exchange for protection from phytophagous insects. We experimentally demonstrated that the ants partially castrate their host plant by destroying almost two-thirds of its floral buds. The ants also impede pollination through their presence and interactions with pollinators. These results reveal that ant activity negatively affects the plant's reproduction both directly and indirectly. This dual negative effect does not result in the complete castration of the plant. We also highlight major limitations to plant reproduction due to the spontaneous abscission of flowers and to the limited quantity and/or poor quality of the pollen. These limitations must not be overlooked since they can alter the outcome of the association of H. physophora with its ant partner. We therefore conclude that the evolutionary fate of the relationship depends on both ant castration intensity and obstacles to plant fertilization not related to the presence of ants.",

    "abstract": "Comparative studies of the population genetics of closely associated species are necessary to properly understand the evolution of these relationships because gene flow between populations affects the partners\u0019 evolutionary potential at the local scale. As a consequence (at least for antagonistic interactions), asymmetries in the strength of the genetic structures of the partner populations can result in one partner having a co\u0010evolutionary advantage. Here, we assess the population genetic structure of partners engaged in a species\u0010specific and obligatory mutualism: the Neotropical ant\u0010plant, Hirtella physophora, and its ant associate, Allomerus decemarticulatus. Although the ant cannot complete its life cycle elsewhere than on H. physophora and the plant cannot live for long without the protection provided by A. decemarticulatus, these species also have antagonistic interactions: the ants have been shown to benefit from castrating their host plant and the plant is able to retaliate against too virulent ant colonies. We found similar short dispersal distances for both partners, resulting in the local transmission of the association and, thus, inbred populations in which too virulent castrating ants face the risk of local extinction due to the absence of H. physophora offspring. On the other hand, we show that the plant populations probably experienced greater gene flow than did the ant populations, thus enhancing the evolutionary potential of the plants. We conclude that such levels of spatial structure in the partners\u0019 populations can increase the stability of the mutualistic relationship. Indeed, the local transmission of the association enables partial alignments of the partners\u0019 interests, and population connectivity allows the plant retaliation mechanisms to be locally adapted to the castration behaviour of their symbionts.",

Such biotic protection by ants can, however, interfere with the activity of pollinators leading to potential negative consequences for the plant's reproduction. In this study, we focused on the association between the understory myrmecophyte, Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), and its obligate ant partner, Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae). We investigated the reproductive biology of H. physophora and the putative mechanisms that may limit ant-pollinator conflict. Our results show that H. physophora is an obligate outcrosser, self-incompatible, and potentially insect-pollinated species. The reproduction of H. physophora relies entirely on pollen transfer by pollinators that are likely quite specific. Potential interference between flower-visiting insects during pollination may also be lessened by a spatial and temporal segregation of ant and pollinator activities, thus enabling pollen transfer and fruit production.",

Through a combination of field surveys and microsatellite genotyping, we examined M. schumanni colony structure, mating system, dispersal, and phylogeography. We discovered that the reproduction of M. schumanni is weakly seasonal, exhibits facultative polyandry, and involves split sex ratios potentially leading to sex-biased dispersal. Surprisingly, we observed only very weak clustering of genetic variation, either within or between devil\u0019s gardens.

Dopamine & tyramine production was positively correlated with the worker locomotor activity.  In Myrmica ants, both brain biogenic ammines were negatively correlated with the aggressive behavior.

    "abstract": "Background Plants in over one hundred families in habitats worldwide bear extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). EFNs display a remarkable diversity of evolutionary origins, as well as diverse morphology and location on the plant. They secrete extrafloral nectar, a carbohydrate-rich food that attracts ants and other arthropods, many of which protect the plant in return. By fostering ecologically important protective mutualisms, EFNs play a significant role in structuring both plant and animal communities. And yet researchers are only now beginning to appreciate their importance and the range of ecological, evolutionary and morphological diversity that EFNs exhibit. Scope This Highlight features a series of papers that illustrate some of the newest directions in the study of EFNs. Here, we introduce this set of papers by providing an overview of current understanding and new insights on EFN diversity, ecology and evolution. We highlight major gaps in our current knowledge, and outline future research directions. Conclusions Our understanding of the roles EFNs play in plant biology is being revolutionized with the use of new tools from developmental biology and genomics, new modes of analysis allowing hypothesis-testing in large-scale phylogenetic frameworks, and new levels of inquiry extending to community-scale interaction networks. But many central questions remain unanswered; indeed, many have not yet been asked. Thus, the EFN puzzle remains an intriguing challenge for the future.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims Plants display a wide range of traits that allow them to use animals for vital tasks. To attract and reward aggressive ants that protect developing leaves and flowers from consumers, many plants bear extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). EFNs are exceptionally diverse in morphology and locations on a plant. In this study the evolution of EFN diversity is explored by focusing on the legume genus Senna , in which EFNs underwent remarkable morphological diversification and occur in over 80 % of the approx. 350 species. Methods EFN diversity in location, morphology and plant ontogeny was characterized in wild and cultivated plants, using scanning electron microscopy and microtome sectioning. From these data EFN evolution was reconstructed in a phylogenetic framework comprising 83 Senna species. Key Results Two distinct kinds of EFNs exist in two unrelated clades within Senna. 'Individualized' EFNs (iEFNs), located on the compound leaves and sometimes at the base of pedicels, display a conspicuous, gland-like nectary structure, are highly diverse in shape and characterize the species-rich EFN clade. Previously overlooked 'non-individualized' EFNs (non-iEFNs) embedded within stipules, bracts, and sepals are cryptic and may represent a new synapomorphy for clade II. Leaves bear EFNs consistently throughout plant ontogeny. In one species, however, early seedlings develop iEFNs between the first pair of leaflets, but later leaves produce them at the leaf base. This ontogenetic shift reflects our inferred diversification history of iEFN location: ancestral leaves bore EFNs between the first pair of leaflets, while leaves derived from them bore EFNs either between multiple pairs of leaflets or at the leaf base. Conclusions EFNs are more diverse than previously thought. EFN-bearing plant parts provide different opportunities for EFN presentation (i.e. location) and individualization (i.e. morphology), with implications for EFN morphological evolution, EFN-ant protective mutualisms and the evolutionary role of EFNs in plant diversification.",

The presence of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, was manipulated in the pitcher plant population to determine if the presence of this non-native ant affects the survival & growth of this carnivorous pitcher plant.  From June-November 2014, mean pitcher height & width, number of pitchers, & proportion of pitchers with herbivory present was recorded monthly.  Results indicated that pitcher width (p = .042) & the number of pitchers (p = .038) was significantly lower, when the presence of S. invicta was reduced.  Specifically, the limited presence of S. invicta led to a 21% reduction in mean number of pitchers & a 2.2% reduction in mean pitcher width.  This indicated that this non-native ant does provide a direct nutritional benefit for the plant.  However, the presence of the ant had no effect on pitcher height & the proportion of pitchers with herbivory present.  But, when the proportion of pitchers with herbivory present was compared to a previous native ant study, herbivory proportions where similar or lower when taking the number of ants present into account.  This suggests that this non-native ant & native ants equally provide defensive benefits for this native threatened species.]",

    "abstract": "Ant communities are generally structured by territoriality, dominance and resource monopolization, but in Mediterranean hot grassland thermal tolerance plays a more important role. The main purposes of the present research were to investigate the hypothesis that in cooler Mediterranean forests resource monopolization structures the generalist ground-nesting ant community while foraging on trees, and to learn if tree heterogeneity plays any role in this structure. In Mediterranean forests in Israel, I visually recorded and trapped ants on the forest floor and those climbing on trees of five species. Ants of 27 species were detected, while the Chao2 index indicated an asymptotic richness estimation of 31 +- 8.1 species (mean +- S.D.). The numerically dominant species were Crematogaster lorteti and Tapinoma simrothi followed by Tapinoma israele and Crematogaster scutellaris. In more than 80% of the cases, specimens of only one ant species climbed at the same time on any individual tree, and no tree was occupied by more than three species. The C-score of climbing ants was statistically higher than simulated indexes when resources were individual trees, indicating that the ants strongly monopolized each tree. No difference was detected between observed and simulated C-scores when resources were tree species. The observed index of Pianka's niche overlap indicated no species specific interaction between trees and ants. In conclusion, this study confirms that ant mosaic structure may be formed by ground-nesting ants while foraging on trees. Tree species heterogeneity did not have a selective impact on the ants nor a central role in the ant community structure.",

    "abstract": "Plant associations with protective ants are widespread among angiosperms, but carry the risk that ants will deter pollinators as well as herbivores. Such conflict, and adaptations to ameliorate or prevent the conflict, have been documented in African and neotropical acacias. Ant-acacia associations occur in Australia, but little is known of their ecology. Moreover, recent phylogenetic evidence indicates that Australian acacias are only distantly related to African and American acacias, providing an intercontinental natural experiment in the management of ant-pollinator conflict. We examined four populations of Acacia myrtifolia over a 400-km environmental gradient in southeastern Australia using ant and pollinator exclusion as well as direct observation of ants and pollinators to assess the potential for ant-pollinator conflict to affect seed set. Native bees were the only group of floral visitors whose visitation rates were a significant predictor of fruiting success, although beetles and wasps may play an important role as \"insurance\" pollinators. We found no increase in pollinator visitation or fruiting success following ant exclusion, even with large sample sizes and effective exclusion. Because ants are facultative visitors to A. myrtifolia plants, their presence may be insufficient to interfere greatly with floral visitors. It is also likely that the morphological location of extrafloral nectaries tends to draw ants away from reproductive parts, although we commonly observed ants on inflorescences, so the spatial separation is not strict. A. myrtifolia appears to maintain a generalized mutualism over a wide geographic range without the need for elaborate adaptations to resolve ant-pollinator conflict.          '[Across all sites, we recorded 57 species from 5 subfamilies of ants tending EFN glands or foraging on A. myrtifolia (Table 1).

I first explored the structure of the behavioral syndrome by testing the consistency & correlation of colony-level behavioral traits under natural conditions in the field.  Traits were both consistent within colonies & correlated among colonies revealing a behavioral syndrome along a docile-aggressive axis.  Host plants of more active, aggressive colonies had less leaf damage, suggesting a link between a colony personality & host plant health.  Then, I studied how aspects of colony sociometry are intertwined with their host plants by assessing the relationship among plant growth, colony growth, colony structure, ant morphology, & colony personality.  Colony personality was independent of host plant measures like tree size, age, or volume.  Finally, I tested how colony personality was influenced by soil nutrients, by assessing personality in the field & transferring colonies to plants the greenhouse under different soil nutrient treatments.  Personality was correlated with soil nutrients in the field, but was not influenced by soil nutrient treatment in the greenhouse.  This suggests that soil nutrients interact with other factors in the environment to structure personality.]",

    "abstract": "A holistic understanding of superorganism biology requires study of colony sociometry, or the quantitative relationships among growth, nest architecture, morphology, and behavior. For ant colonies that obligately nest within plant hosts, their sociometry is likely intertwined with the plant, which has implications for the evolution, strength, and stability of the mutualism. In the Azteca-Cecropia mutualism, plants provide ants with food rewards and hollow stems for nesting in return for protection from herbivores. Several interesting questions arise when considering ant-plant sociometry: are colony growth and plant growth synchronized? How do colonies distribute themselves within the stem of their host plant? How do plant traits influence worker morphology? How is collective personality related to tree structure, nest organization, and worker morphology? To address these questions, we investigated patterns within and relationships among five major sociometric categories of colonies in the field -- plant traits, colony size, nest organization, worker morphology, and collective personality. We found that colony sociometry was intimately intertwined with host plant traits. Colony and plant growth rates were synchronized, suggesting that positive feedback between plant and colony growth stabilizes the mutualism. The colony\u0019s distribution inside the host tree tended to follow leaf growth, with most workers, brood, and the queen in the top half of the tree. Worker morphology correlated with plant size instead of colony size or age, which suggests that plant traits influence worker development. Colony personality was independent of colony distribution and tree structure but may correlate with worker size such that colonies with smaller, less variable workers had more aggressive personalities. This study provides insights into how ant-plant structural relationships may contribute to plant protection and the strength of mutualisms.

    "abstract": "For interspecific mutualisms, the behavior of one partner can influence the fitness of the other, especially in the case of symbiotic mutualisms where partners live in close physical association for much of their lives. Behavioral effects on fitness may be particularly important if either species in these long-term relationships displays personality. We conducted a field study on collective personality in Azteca constructor colonies that live in Cecropia trees, one of the most successful and prominent mutualisms of the neotropics. These pioneer plants provide hollow internodes for nesting and nutrient-rich food bodies; in return, the ants provide protection from herbivores and encroaching vines. We tested the consistency and correlation of 5 colony-level behavioral traits, censused colonies, and measured the amount of leaf damage for each plant. Four of five traits were both consistent within colonies and correlated among colonies. This reveals a behavioral syndrome along a docile-aggressive axis, with higher-scoring colonies showing greater activity, aggression, and responsiveness. Scores varied substantially between colonies and were independent of colony size and age. Host plants of more active, aggressive colonies had less leaf damage, suggesting a link between a colony\u0019s personality and effective defense of its host, though the directionality of this link remains uncertain. Our field study shows that colony personality is an ecologically relevant phenomenon and sheds light on the importance of behavioral differences within mutualism dynamics.

Giraffes are abundant and wide-ranging herbivores of the acacias, whereas black rhinos are localized and perennial herbivores of the acacias. Multiyear field studies comparing the ants' aggressive behaviour and browsing by mega-herbivores suggested differences between the tending abilities of the primary ant species inhabiting A. drepanolobium. Trees occupied by the aggressive ant species C. mimosae had significantly less browsing by giraffes and black rhino than trees occupied by other ant species. The results of this study provide evidence that ant-mutualists on African acacias can serve as deterrents to mega-herbivores and that different ant species vary in their tending abilities.",

    "abstract": "1. The major aim of this paper was to explore the mechanistic basis of induced defensive ant response in myrmecophytic Piper species and their ant-partner Pheidole bicornis by combining experimental trials and chemical analysis. 2. In field experiments, the response of Pheidole ants to simulated stem-damage of their host plant was documented. Their reaction to other myrmecophytic and non-myrmecophytic Piper species was explored by fixing respective stem sections onto inhabited Piper fimbriulatum individuals. After artificial damage to stems of P. fimbriulatum and stem sections from other myrmecophytic Piper, the number of ants increased to a maximum of 63 individuals on the damaged internode within the first 10 min. By contrast, no or only a poor reaction was elicited by stem sections from the selected non-myrmecophytic Piper species. 3. Solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified 68 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which were emitted from wounded stem bark of three myrmecophytic (P. fimbriulatum, P. obliquum, P. sagittifolium) and two non-myrmecophytic (P. hispidum, P. riparense) Piper species, comprising monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, simple aromatic compounds, and green leaf volatiles (GLVs, oxylipins). Despite considerable variation in the VOC profiles, an analysis of similarities (anosim) classified the accumulation of the sesquiterpenes \ufb02-caryophyllene, germacrene D and emission of the oxylipin reactive electrophilic species (RES) compounds hexanal, cis-3-hexene-1-ol, 2-hexenal, 2-undecanone and 1-hexanol as characteristic of the myrmecophytic species. 4. Synthesis. Field experiments showed that mechanical disturbance of myrmecophytic Piper stems is not sufficient to elicit recruitment and alertness of the ant-partner Ph. bicornis, but that specific volatiles released from the host plant are responsible. Analyses of the VOCs identified after simulated stem damage of three myrmecophytic and two non-myrmecophytic Piper species revealed differences in their VOC emission profiles: Only in the myrmecophytic species were induced stress compounds found, such as various oxylipin RES or the sesquiterpene \ufb02-caryophyllene, which are typically emitted after plant damage for interplant signaling. Some of these compounds (e.g. hexanal, 1-hexanol) are known to induce alerting and alarm behaviors in several ant species. Our study provides evidence that the VOCs of the Piper host plant may signal stem damage and induce recruitment and alert behavior of associated Pheidole ants.",

As several species of Chaetothyriales tolerate, adsorb, & metabolize toxic volatiles, we investigated the composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of selected domatia in the Azteca/Cecropia ant-plant mutualism.  Concentrations of VOCs in ant-inhabited domatia, empty domatia, & background air were compared.  In total, 211 compounds belonging to 19 chemical families were identified.  Ant-inhabited domatia were dominated by ketones with 2-heptanone, a well-known ant alarm semiochemical, as the most abundant volatile.  Empty domatia were characterized by relatively high concentrations of the monoterpenes d-limonene, p-cymene & \u2264-phellandrene, as well as the heterocyclic sulphur-containing compound, benzothiazole.  These compounds have biocidal properties & are primarily biosynthesized by plants as a defense mechanism.  Interestingly, most of the latter compounds were present at lower concentrations in ant inhabited domatia than in non-colonized ones.  We suggest that Chaetothyriales may play a role in reducing the VOCs, underlining that the mutualistic nature of these fungi as VOCs accumulation might be detrimental for the ants, especially the larvae.]",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant symbioses involve plants that provide hollow structures specialized for housing ants and often food to ants. In return, the inhabiting ants protect plants against herbivores and sometimes provide them with nutrients. Here, we review recent advances in ant-plant symbioses, focusing on three areas. First, the nutritional ecology of plant-ants, which is based not only on plant-derived food rewards, but also on inputs from other symbiotic partners, in particular fungi and possibly bacteria. Food and protection are the most important 'currencies' exchanged between partners and they drive the nature and evolution of the relationships. Secondly, studies of conflict and cooperation in ant-plant symbioses have contributed key insights into the evolution and maintenance of mutualism, particularly how partner-mediated feedbacks affect the specificity and stability of mutualisms. There is little evidence that mutualistic ants or plants are under selection to cheat, but the costs and benefits of ant-plant interactions do vary with environmental factors, making them vulnerable to natural or anthropogenic environmental change. Thus, thirdly, ant-plant symbioses should be considered good models for investigating the effects of global change on the outcome of mutualistic interactions",

    "abstract": "The construction process and use of galleries by Azteca brevis (Myrmicinae: Dolichoderinae) inhabiting Tetrathylacium macrophyllum (Salicaceae) were compared with Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae: Solenopsidini) galleries on Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae). Though the two ant species are phylogenetically distant, the gallery structure seems to be surprisingly similar and structurally convergent: both are pierced with numerous holes and both ant species use Chaetothyrialean fungi to strengthen the gallery walls. Al. decemarticulatus is known to use the galleries for prey capture and whether this is also the case for Az. brevis was tested in field experiments. We placed Atta workers as potential prey/threat on the galleries and recorded the behaviour of both ant species. We found considerable behavioural differences between them: Al. decemarticulatus was quicker and more efficient at capture than was Az. brevis. While most Atta workers were captured after the first 5 min by Al. decemarticulatus, significantly fewer were captured by Az. brevis even after 20 min. Moreover, the captured Atta were sometimes simply discarded and not taken to the nest by Az. brevis. As a consequence, the major function of the galleries built by Az. brevis may, therefore, be defense against intruders in contrast to Al. decemarticulatus which uses them mainly for prey capture. This may be due to a higher need for protein in Al. decemarticulatus compared to coccid-raising Az. brevis.          *[Azteca brevis (Forel 1899) (Dolichoderinae) was studied in the Parque Nacional Piedras Blancas, Costa  Rica, on Tetrathylacium macrophyllum.

Ant-related features of Leonardoxa include foliar nectaries and swollen internodes which, when young, are excavated and occupied by the ants. Petalomyrmex workers protect the young leaves of Leonardoxa from herbivores. In the study site, possession of a Petalomyrmex colony appears to be required for a Leonardoxa shoot to survive to adulthood. In contrast, Cataulacus workers do not protect the plant and exclude Petalomyrmex from shoots they occupy; this species can be considered a parasite on the Leonardoxa-Petalomyrmex mutualism. Petalomyrmex workers patrol only the young leaves of Leonardoxa. Mature leaves are not patrolled but accumulate extremely little herbivore damage, being well defended chemically and mechanically. The hypothesis is proposed that in ant-plants such as Leonardoxa, whose leaves are very long-lived, the cost of providing leaves with permanent chemical or mechanical protection decreases relative to the cost of maintaining a large worker force of ants throughout the life of the leaf. A smaller worker force is maintained that patrols only the young leaves.",

In facultative interactions, biotic defenses complement the plant\u00a5s other anti-herbivore defenses. Biotic defense is important for chemically and mechanically vulnerable young tissues, especially those lacking effective phenological defense. It functionally resembles mobile chemical defenses, explaining patterns in the interplay between chemical and biotic defenses in myrmecophytes. Biotic defenses differ from most others in that they are not inherited but must be acquired, a fact with important consequences for the biology of juvenile myrmecophytes. - As the ecology of arboricolous ants is studied in increasing depth, patterns in variation among ant-plant systems, and the functional significance of variation, are becoming clear. Though in its infancy, a comparative biology of protective ant-plant interactions is emerging, similar to that of pollination biology. - Two complementary dynamics of species-specific ant-plantsymbioses are briefly presented: study of symbiotic, but facultative associations, probably similar to the evolutionary antecedents of obligate symbioses, and historical ecology, combining comparative field study with phylogenetic analysis of plants and ants.",

Myrmecochorous legumes occur most frequently in habitats that are fire-prone and characterized by nutrient-poor soil and a large proportion of bare ground. (...) Protective interactions may be facultative or obligate. In the legumes, facultative interactions involve foraging ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries. Extrafloral nectaries are documented in all three subfamilies, but their frequency varies greatly among taxonomic groups. (....) In short-lived legumes, nectaries function primarily in protection of reproductive parts, whereas in long-lived woody legumes, ants attracted to nectaries primarily protect young leaves. In woody legumes, nectaries are most common in groups that produce young leaves relatively continuously, and rare in groups that produce young leaves intermittently in large flushes. (...)",

This work, based on field, greenhouse, & herbarium studies, demonstrates that L. africana is a complex of 4 closely related taxa, with a wider distribution in West Africa.  The complex is treated here as subspecies: L. africana subsp. africana (tree to 14 m tall, stem (rarely) to 40 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), usually under 15 cm dbh); subsp. gracilicaulis McKey (tree to 25 m tall, stem to 50-60 cm dbh); subsp. letouzeyi McKey (small tree, (rarely) to 14 m tall, stem to 30 cm dbh); & subsp. rumpiensis McKey (small tree to 14 m tall, stem to 35 cm dbh).  The new taxa are described & relationships within the complex are discussed.  The complex is interpreted as a ring species of mostly allopatric subspecies in which the 2 most extreme variants, the subspecies africana & gracilicaulis, have a narrow zone of sympatry in which they co-occur in the same communities & remain distinct.  Data on ecology & natural history are presented, emphasising ant-plant interactions.  Coevolutionary interactions with certain ants appear to be an important factor driving differentiation in this complex.  Of the 4 subspecies, all but gracilicaulis are myrmecophytes, with swollen hollow stems occupied by symbiotic ants.]",

Ant colonies that provide increased benefits to the host plant enhance its growth & survival, thus receiving more benefits from it, & vice versa.  Selection favors mutualistic traits, & interests of the 2 partners tend to converge.  However, because these associations are horizontally transmitted, neither partner obtains benefits from reproduction of the other.

(Lauraceae) and their cryptic ant symbiont, Myrmelachista flavocotea, is common in lowland wet forests of Costa Rica, yet it is unclear whether the association is typically mutualistic or parasitic. Ants impose costs by tending trophobionts inside the plant body and further compromise the structural integrity of their host by hollowing its stems. Benefits to the host, including anti-herbivore defense and nutrient provisioning, must outweigh these costs for the association to be mutualistic, but benefits in this system are largely unknown. We adopted a stable isotope approach to investigate trophic relationships among Ocotea hosts, coccoid trophobionts, and worker and larval ants in the understory of mature forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. In addition, a natural stable isotope marker (tuna) was made available to M. flavocotea colonies to determine whether ants are fortuitous scavengers and/or provision their host. In this system, we found unusual patterns of isotopic fractionation. For coccoids, nitrogen isotopes are only slightly enriched, and carbon isotopes were depleted relative to the host signature. Moreover, nitrogen signatures of the timid Myrmelachista ants are high, suggesting a substantial degree of carnivory and/or scavenging in this species. In the provisioning study, ant colonies provided with baits demonstrated a significant shift in carbon isotopic composition relative to untreated colonies indicating uptake and assimilation of the bait. These results suggest that these timid ants are patrolling the plant for food and concentrating nutrients in Ocotea's hollowed stems. Further studies are required to confirm if M. flavocotea provides a net benefit to its host by providing nutrients, reducing herbivory, or by removing detrimental debris from the plants surface.",

Here, we show for the first time how a non-ant invasive species negatively affects seed dispersal by ants. We examined the effects of several animal species that co-occur in a temperate deciduous forest - including native and invasive seed-dispersing ants (Aphaenogaster rudis and Myrmica rubra, respectively), an invasive slug (Arion subfuscus), and native rodents - on a native myrmecochorous plant, Asarum canadense. We experimentally manipulated ant, slug, and rodent access to seed depots and measured seed removal. We also video-recorded depots to determine which other taxa interact with seeds. We found that A. rudis was the main disperser of seeds and that A. subfuscus consumed elaiosomes without dispersing seeds. Rodent visitation was rare, and rodent exclusion had no significant effect on seed or elaiosome removal. We then used data obtained from laboratory and field mesocosm experiments to determine how elaiosome robbing by A. subfuscus affects seed dispersal by A. rudis and M. rubra. We found that elaiosome robbing by slugs reduced seed dispersal by ants, especially in mesocosms with A. rudis, which picks up seeds more slowly than M. rubra. Taken together, our results show that elaiosome robbing by an invasive slug reduces seed dispersal by ants, suggesting that invasive slugs can have profound negative effects on seed dispersal mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "PREMISE: Extrafloral nectaries have mainly been studied in angiosperms, but have also been reported in 39 fern species. Here we provide a global review of nectaries in ferns and examined their structure, function, and nectar sugar composition in two genera. METHODS: We searched in the literature and living plant collections of botanical gardens for indications of fern nectaries, observed nectar\u0010feeding animals, studied the morphoanatomy in the two genera Aglaomorpha and Campyloneurum, and analyzed the total sugar concentrations and ratios of 16 species. Diurnal nectar release was observed with time\u0010lapse photography. RESULTS: We found evidence for nectaries in 101 species of ferns from 11 genera and 6 families. Most of the nectary\u0010bearing species were tree ferns (Cyatheaceae) and epiphytic ferns of the family Polypodiaceae. Nectaries consisted of cytoplasm\u0010rich parenchyma with large nuclei and an epidermis with or without stomata, were attached to amphiphloic vascular bundles, and released nectar on the lower leaf surface mainly on expanding leaves during the night. Sugar concentrations varied between species (3.8\u001315.3%) but not between genera, and were sucrose\u0010dominant (3 spp.), sucrose\u0010rich (7), or hexose\u0010rich (3). In the greenhouse, introduced ants, scale insects, and snails fed on the nectar. CONCLUSIONS: The wide taxonomic distribution, variable morphology, locations, and sugar compositions point to multiple evolutionary origins of fern nectaries. Nectar release in young leaves might attract mutualistic ants to protect leaves against herbivores only during this most vulnerable developmental stage. Even ex\u0010situ, fern nectar is a valuable food source because it attracted several opportunistic animal species.",

In addition, biotic defence by ants can directly influence the populations of herbivores, as demonstrated by increased rates of herbivory or increased herbivore density after ant exclusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate bottom\u0010up and top\u0010down effects on herbivory rates in a mutualistic ant\u0010plant. 2. In this study, the role of Azteca alfari ants as biotic defence in individuals of Cecropia pachystachya was investigated experimentally with a simultaneous manipulation of both bottom\u0010up (fertilisation) and top\u0010down (ant exclusion) factors. Four treatments were used in a fully factorial design, with 15 replicates for each treatment: (i) control plants, without manipulation; (ii) fertilised plants, ants not manipulated; (iii) unfertilised plants and excluded ants and (iv) fertilised plants and ants excluded. 3. Fertilisation increased the availability of foliar nitrogen in C. pachystachya, and herbivory rates by chewing insects were significantly higher in fertilised plants with ants excluded. 4. Herbivory, however, was more influenced by bottom\u0010up effects - such as the quality of the host plant - than by top\u0010down effects caused by ants as biotic defences, reinforcing the crucial role of leaf nutritional quality for herbivory levels experienced by plants. Conditionality in ant defence under increased nutritional quality of leaves through fertilisation might explain increased levels of herbivory in plants with higher leaf nitrogen.",

    "abstract": "Urban environments are characterized by profound differences in abiotic conditions compared to natural environments, which filter one part of the biotic communities that endure living in these environments. A conspicuous element in many cities are scattered trees, often included in urban planning around the world. These trees are key elements for urban ecological processes and services and act as habitat islands, providing resources (i.e., food and shelter) for a considerable arthropod diversity, such as ants. Studies involving ants in urban environments often focus on ground-dwelling ants, and few studies seek to glimpse the ants that occupy scattered trees and, even less, how these ants and trees interact within cities. This study aimed to investigate the ant communities foraging day and night on trees in an urban area inside a biodiversity hotspot, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Specifically, we investigated how tree characteristics (tree size, tree isolation, and the tree origin, i.e., native and exotic) modulate ant diversity and ant-plant interactions. We found that the ant species composition is different between day and night, as well as the central core of generalist ant species of day and night interaction networks. The tree size increases beta-diversity among trees only of the nocturnal ant community, while none of the tree characteristics shaped the ant community. This study is the first to address the role of scattered trees in maintaining the diversity of arboreal ants in urban landscapes, focusing on species diversity and their interaction networks. Overall, we provide insights supporting the conservation value of scattered trees in maintaining urban biodiversity.          *[We recorded 19 ant species belonging to 5 subfamilies & 11 genera.  Only 3 ant species were exotic (15.8 %): Tapinoma melanocephalum, Cardiocondyla obscurior, & Monomorium floricola]",

    "abstract": "The ocrea is an extension of the leaf sheath that occurs in a wide range of angiosperms, including some rattan palms (Arecaceae/Palmae). In some rattan species, the ocrea is an inflated sac-like structure that acts as a domatium. Typically, ants occupy this domatium, tending their young and husbanding aphids, and potentially providing a defence mechanism for the rattan. We present a comparative study of early leaf development in five palm species, including both ocreate and non-ocreate taxa. Early leaf development was examined using SEM in Calamus longipinna, which has a pronounced ocrea, and compared with two other Calamus species with an inconspicuous ocrea, and two non-ocreate palms, Chamaedorea pochutlensis and Rhapis humilis. All three Calamus species examined develop an extension from the top of the leaf sheath, in contrast with the non-ocreate palms examined for comparison. The ocrea is a vascularized outgrowth from the top of the leaf sheath, initiated shortly after differentiation of the lamina and sheath. Calamus longipinna differs from the other two Calamus species in that plications develop on the surface of the ocrea, and persist as folds on the ocrea surface. The highly unusual ocreate plications of C. longipinna form axial folds that permit the sac-like ocrea to become inflated, and give it the properties of a domatium, thus facilitating the ant-plant interaction in this species. The homologies of the ocrea in rattans require further review because the interpretation of leaf-derived appendages such as ligules and stipules remains controversial based on contradictory evidence from location and vasculature.          *[Calamus longipinna (native to Papua New Guinea), C. australis (from Australia), & C.  caryotoides (from Australia) were obtained from the living collections at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England.]",

Floral bud nectar was secreted at the tip of the petals, which lack a typical glandular structure, but possess distinctive mesophyll due to the presence of numerous calcium oxalate crystals.  The nectar, the production of which ceased after flower opening, was composed mainly of sucrose & low amounts of glucose and fructose.  Nectar was consumed by generalist ants & sporadically by stingless bees.  Ant exclusion experiments resulted in significantly increased flower damage.  The floral nectar of T. guianensis is produced during the bud stage.  This bud-nectar has the extranuptial function of attracting generalist ants that reduce florivory.

Secondly, we summarise the previously described physical characteristics of the fairy circles, e.g. soil substrate, moisture content, shape, size, lifespan, dynamics and spatial patterning, and then present the supporting evidence as published by the proponents of the theories on vegetation self-arrangement, insects/ants, gas and Euphorbia allelopathy, as the causative drivers of this natural phenomenon.

We compared the occurrence of ants and lianas on B. fistulosa trees in areas of Gabon, where the invasive little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, was absent (uninfested area) and present (infested area).  We found that T. aethiops occurred significantly more often in larger B. fistulosa trees, and that occurrence rates were much higher in the uninfested area versus the infested area: on < 1 m trees: 17% vs. 0%; 1-5 m trees: 58% vs. 3%; > 5 m trees: 90% vs. 10%).  In contrast, lianas occurred significantly less often in the uninfested area versus the infested area: on < 1 m trees: 0% vs. 100%; 1-5 m trees: 0% vs. 77%; > 5 m trees: 10% vs. 63%).  In the infested area, W. auropunctata occurred significantly less often in larger B. fistulosa trees (on < 1 m trees: 100%; 1-5 m trees: 97%; > 5 m trees: 90%). Here T. aethiops and W. auropunctata coexisted on few trees (on < 1 m trees: 0%; 1-5 m trees: 1%; > 5 m trees: 4%).  The negative consequences for the trees are already evident, and the situation for native ants is likely to decline further in future because they will not be able to generate the large (relatively resistant) colonies found on large trees.",

However, the ecological nature of this association is not well understood, and the information on palm-ant interactions is primarily anecdotal. Here, we conducted a field study in the secondary forest of the Danum Valley Conservation Area, Malaysian Borneo, on 41 individuals of the rattan Korthalsia furtadoana. All studied plants showed signs of a past or present partnership with domatia-nesting ants, as indicated by entry holes in domatia. In 14 plants, our physical disturbance of a stem provoked the appearance of patrolling ants of Camponotus sp. We compared the leaf conditions of rattans with and without patrolling ants, testing whether the presence of ants is linked to improved leaf health. The leaflets of plants with patrolling ants were significantly less physically damaged and less covered by epiphylls. On average, 19% of the leaflets of plants with patrolling ants were damaged (52% in plants without patrolling ants), and the epiphyll cover of their leaflets was 0.2 on our scale of 0-4 (1.3 in plants without patrolling ants). Our results suggest that this poorly studied plant-ant association has a mutualistic character. It seems that the ants take advantage of the nesting space created by the plant partner, while the plants gain protection for their photosynthetic apparatus against herbivores and epiphylls.",

    "abstract": "PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Comparing ecological attributes of endemic species with related, widespread species can reveal differences accounting for rarity. Forests of the southeastern United States are home to many range\u0010restricted endemic and widespread species of Trillium, a genus of ant\u0010dispersed herbs. Evidence suggests that aspects of seed\u0010related life history stages are often correlated with plant rarity, but few studies have tested whether the process of seed dispersal differs for endemic and widespread species. To address this question, we compared aspects of seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) for three sympatric, widespread endemic Trillium species pairs. METHODS: We observed seed dispersal for Trillium species pairs by ants at eight sites, recorded numbers of seeds dispersed and dispersal distances, and described disperser interactions. To test disperser preference, we presented seeds of each pair to captive colonies of Aphaenogaster picea, a keystone disperser. Seeds were assigned scores based on worker behavior, and we recorded proportions of seeds dispersed after 1 h and 24 h. KEY RESULTS: Field observations yielded some significant within\u0010pair differences. Ants dispersed more seeds of widespread species for all pairs, although dispersal distances did not differ. In laboratory experiments, after 24 h, ants dispersed more seeds of widespread species into nests. CONCLUSIONS: Endemic Trillium species had lower overall SDE than did their widespread congeners. These findings add to the list of ecological and demographic challenges that face endemic plants when compared to common congeners. Lower SDE may negatively impact reproductive rates and the colonization of new habitats, which may contribute to patterns of endemism.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific facultative mutualisms typically involve guilds of interacting species, and species within a guild can vary in the quality of services they provide.  For plants that secrete extrafloral nectar (EFN), visitation by multiple ant species that vary in anti-herbivore abilities may result in reduced benefits, relative to an exclusive association with a high-quality mutualist. This raises the intriguing problem of how facultative ant-plant mutualisms persist, given that EFN is costly to produce, yet may confer diminishing returns as partner diversity increases. I tested the prediction that association with two ant partners (Crematogaster opuntiae and Liometopum apiculatum) weakens benefits to the EFN-producing tree cholla cactus (Opuntia imbricata). I found that only one ant (L. apiculatum) provided protection against herbivores and seed predators. However, this species associated with cacti more frequently than Crematogaster across multiple temporal scales. Within years, Liometopum showed greater constancy on plants they occupied, more frequently colonized vacant plants, and replaced but were never replaced by Crematogaster. Across years of plant development, Liometopum was more abundant on reproductive plants and showed greater overlap with cactus enemies. Simulations of cactus lifetime reproductive output indicated that associating with high- and low-quality mutualists did not significantly reduce plant benefits relative to an exclusive L. apiculatum-O. imbricate association. The results suggest that non-random interaction frequencies, possibly driven by competition, may contribute to the maintenance of facultative mutualisms involving multiple, qualitatively different partners.",

    "abstract": "Many plants engage ants in defensive mutualisms by offering extrafloral nectar (EFN). Identifying sources of variation in EFN quantity (amount) and quality (composition) is important because they can affect ant visitation and identity and hence effectiveness of plant defence.  I investigated plant size and reproductive state (vegetative or flowering) as sources of variation in EFN quantity and quality. I focused on Opuntia imbricata and two ant partners, Crematogaster opuntiae and Liometopum apiculatum. I tested the influence of plant size and nectary type (vegetative vs. reproductive structure) on the probability and rate of EFN secretion, concentrations of total carbohydrates (CH) and amino acids (AAs), and relative abundances of constituent CH and AAs. I also examined how traits of individual nectaries scaled up to influence total plant-level rewards. Parallel observations documented associations between plant demographic state and ant visitation and species identity.  EFN quantity and quality were generally greater for larger, reproductive plants. At the scale of individual nectaries, probability of EFN secretion was positively size-dependent and greater for nectaries on reproductive vs. vegetative structures. Rate of EFN secretion, carbohydrate and amino acid concentrations, and the relative abundance of disaccharide vs. monosaccharide sugars were greater for reproductive nectaries but were unaffected by plant size.  Nectary-level traits scaled up to influence rewards at the whole-plant level in ways that corresponded to ant visitation: the probability of ant occupancy increased with plant size and reproduction, as did the likelihood of being tended by the superior guard, L. apiculatum. Variability in EFN traits may contribute to changes in ant occupancy and identity across plant sizes and reproductive states.  Synthesis. This study provides a thorough examination of how plant investment in biotic defence varies over the life cycle. Explicit consideration of plant demography may enhance understanding of ant-plant mutualisms. Populations of long-lived plants are demographically heterogeneous, spanning sizes and reproductive states. The rewards offered to animal mutualists can track demographic heterogeneity with consequences for plant defence and the dynamics of multispecies mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Nearly every terrestrial ecosystem hosts invasive ant species, and many of those ant species construct underground nests near roots and/or tend phloem\u0010feeding hemipterans on plants. We have a limited understanding of how these invasive ant behaviours change photosynthesis, carbohydrate availability and growth of woody plants. We measured photosynthesis, water relations, carbohydrate concentrations and growth for screenhouse\u0010reared Acacia drepanolobium saplings on which we had manipulated invasive Pheidole megacephala ants and native Ceroplastes sp. hemipterans to determine whether and how soil nesting and hemipteran tending by ants affect plant carbon dynamics. In a field study, we also compared leaf counts of vertebrate herbivore\u0010excluded and \u0010exposed saplings in invaded and non\u0010invaded savannas to examine how ant invasion and vertebrate herbivory are associated with differences in sapling photosynthetic crown size. Though hemipteran infestations are often linked to declines in plant performance, our screenhouse experiment did not find an association between hemipteran presence and differences in plant physiology. However, we did find that soil nesting by P. megacephala around screenhouse plants was associated with >58% lower whole\u0010crown photosynthesis, >31% lower pre\u0010dawn leaf water potential, >29% lower sucrose concentrations in woody tissues and >29% smaller leaf areas. In the field, sapling crowns were 29% smaller in invaded savannas than in non\u0010invaded savannas, mimicking screenhouse results. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil nesting near roots, a common behaviour by Pheidole megacephala and other invasive ants, can directly reduce carbon fixation and storage of Acacia drepanolobium saplings. This mechanism is distinct from the disruption of a native ant mutualism by P. megacephala, which causes similar large declines in carbon fixation for mature A. drepanolobium trees. Acacia drepanolobium already has extremely low natural rates of recruitment from the sapling to mature stage, and we infer that these negative effects of invasion on saplings potentially curtail recruitment and reduce population growth in invaded areas. Our results suggest that direct interactions between invasive ants and plant roots in other ecosystems may strongly influence plant carbon fixation and storage.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative interactions may frequently be reinforced by 'partner fidelity feedback', in which high- or low-quality partners drive positive feedbacks with high or low benefits for the host, respectively. Benefits of plant\u0013animal mutualisms for plants have been quantified almost universally in terms of growth or reproduction, but these are only two of many sinks to which a host-plant allocates its resources. By investigating how partners to host-plants impact two fundamental plant resources, carbon and water, we can better characterize plant\u0013partner fidelity and understand how plant\u0013partner mutualisms may be modulated by resource dynamics. In Laikipia, Kenya, four ant species compete for Acacia drepanolobium host-plants. These ants differ in multiple traits, from nectar consumption to host-plant protection. Using a 5-year ant removal experiment, we compared carbon fixation, leaf water status, and stem non-structural carbohydrate concentrations for adult ant\u0013plants with and without ant partners. Removal treatments showed that the ants differentially mediate tree carbon and/or water resources. All three ant species known to be aggressive against herbivores were linked to benefits for host-plant resources, but only the two species that defend but do not prune the host, Crematogaster mimosae and Tetraponera penzigi, increased tree carbon fixation. Of these two species, only the nectivore C. mimosae increased tree simple sugars. Crematogaster nigriceps, which defends the tree but also castrates flowers and prunes meristems, was linked only to lower tree water stress approximated by pre-dawn leaf water potential. In contrast to those defensive ants, Crematogaster sjostedti, a poor defender that displaces other ants, was linked to lower tree carbon fixation. Comparing the effects of the four ant species across control trees suggests that differential ant occupancy drives substantial differences in carbon and water supply among host trees. Our results highlight that ant partners can positively or negatively impact carbon and/or water relations for their host-plant, and we discuss the likelihood that carbon- and water-related partner fidelity feedback loops occur across ant\u0013plant mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing number of studies dealing with interaction networks in the last few years, there is still a lack of knowledge about how their structural organization are affected by changes in binary or weighted data. To fill this gap, we collected ants foraging on plants with extrafloral nectaries in 10 sites within the Brazilian Amazon to evaluate if the generality, vulnerability, nestedness, and modularity observed in these ant-plant networks could be affected by changes in data categories. Specifically, we used three matrices built by different data categories: (i) binary data (i.e., presence or absence of an interaction between a plant and an ant species); (ii) frequency data (i.e., number of times in which a plant species interacted with an ant species); and (iii) abundance data (i.e., number of workers of an ant species recorded foraging on a plant species). In general, when analyzing different matrix categories, we observed changes in the structural organization of the studied ant-plant interaction networks. Surprisingly, however, at the species level, both categories of weighted data (i.e., frequency and abundance data) seem to be equally appropriate for describing the role of ant species. Our results highlight the need to expand the discussion about data categories in ecological interaction studies to understand how different data categories may lead to different ecological interpretations.          *[We recorded a total of 56 ant species (or morphospecies) belonging to 19 genera & 7 subfamilies (Appendix S3).]",

We carried out this study in ten forest fragments, ranging in size from approximately 5 to 3,000 ha, located in the Brazilian Amazon. In each fragment we established a plot of 6,250 m2, in which all ant-plant interactions were recorded, and calculated the following network descriptors: number of interactions, network size, network specialization, diversity of interactions, and nestedness. We used four explanatory variables to investigate the effects of forest fragmentation on these network descriptors: three metrics of the configuration of fragments (i.e., fragment area, edge irregularity, and connectivity) and the forest structure within each fragment, represented by canopy cover. We did not detect any effect of the explanatory variables on the network descriptors. The structural stability of the networks sampled in forest fragments with different configurations is possibly related to the observed constancy of ant species in the central core of highly interacting species. Our results corroborate other studies highlighting the structural stability of these facultative ant-plant networks mediated by EFNs in different spatial and temporal gradients.]          *[Neoponera unidentata misspelled Neoponera unidentada.]",

Later, as more systematic collections were made from the region, Malaysian ants were listed in several publications by other European scientists in the early 1900s. However, few taxonomic or revisionary works had been carried out on the Malaysian fauna, perhaps due to the relatively inadequate number of samples collected and the poor condition of the specimens. More recently, other aspects of ant biology have been investigated. A German group, as early as the 1970s, worked on ecological aspects ranging from the shifting nest behavior of Leptogenys in Gombak Forest Reserve, Selangor, to looking at distribution and abundance of plants with extrafloral nectaries in the woody flora of Pasoh Forest Reserve, Negeri Sembilan. Other topics include ant-plant relationships and symbiosis of ants with other groups of insects. The mid 1980s also saw the participation of local scientists in ant research. Intensive collections were made from various locations in the peninsula from 1986 to 1991. This was extended to Sabah and Sarawak until the present time. Early 1990 also saw the participation of Japanese scientists in collecting ants from Malaysia. The prospect of different collection techniques are discussed. Other applied aspects of ant studies are now underway in Malaysia. Ants had been viewed as potential biological control agents, especially so for the species Dolichoderus thoracicus which keeps populations of Conopomorpha cramerella and Helopeltis theobromae low in cocoa plantations. Certain species of ants had also been suggested to be good bioindicators of forest quality.]",

To our knowledge, no study has been conducted to concurrently investigate the fluctuation of plant fitness over its whole reproductive season, recording and comparing both short periods (different samplings during the plant\u0019s reproductive season) and the season/pooled data (all fruits produced during the reproductive season). Here, by assigning plants to either ant-present or absent treatments, we investigated the influence of the protective foliage-dwelling ant, Camponotus crassus, on the flower bud and fruit production of four extrafloral nectaried plants (Ancistrotropis firmula, Bionia coriacea, Cochlospermum regium, and Peixotoa tomentosa) throughout their annual reproductive season. Periodic samples in the field revealed a large variation in plant reproduction throughout the season; the increases in buds and fruits were not constantly higher in plants with ants, and in fact, plants without ants had more reproductive structures sometimes. Nonetheless, the examination of the pooled data, i.e., cumulative number of flower buds and fruits produced during the reproductive season, revealed the plants with ants produced more flower buds and fruits (e.g., up to two-fold greater in A. firmula) compared to ant-absent treatments. Our results indicate the effects of ants on plant reproduction are not constant over time, but the net benefits to plants with ants are reflected in increased fruit production. Therefore, the investigations of the benefit of ants on plants should consider the whole plant\u0019s reproductive season rather than single samplings within plant reproduction period.",

    "abstract": "Insect-plant interactions occur in several ways and have considerable environmental and ecological importance. Many feeding strategies have evolved among herbivorous insects, with host-herbivore systems likely being influenced by trophobionts with ants. We investigated how these interactions vary across elevation gradients by evaluating the structure of the herbivorous insect community and ants associated with Baccharis dracunculifolia at three distinct elevations (800, 1100, and 1400 m a.s.l.) on a mountain in southeastern Brazil. Moreover, we evaluated the diversity and specialisation of interactions between herbivores and host plants along the elevational gradient. We sampled herbivores and ants on 60 plants at each elevation (totalling 180 plant individuals). Herbivore species composition differed among elevations, as did interaction diversity and specialisation. Richness and abundance of chewing insects increased with elevation, while \u2264\u0010diversity among patches of the host plant was higher at the lowest elevation, probably due to the patchy occurrence of B. dracunculifolia. Richness and abundance of sap\u0010sucking insects were higher at the intermediate elevation, possibly due to local environmental conditions. We observed a positive relationship between ant and herbivore trophobiont richness on B. dracunculifolia. We found that interactions were more specialised and less diverse at higher elevations compared to the lowest elevation. Changes in vegetation and environmental variables shaped species distributions and their ecological interactions along the elevation gradient. Our study demonstrates that increased elevation changes the structure and patterns of interactions of the herbivore insect guilds associated with the host plant B. dracunculifolia. Ant effects depend on the context, the environment, and the species of ants involved, and are essential for the presence of insect trophobionts.          *[We collected 233 ants from 27 species.

We hypothesised that the ants' energetic needs for nearly constant gallery digging could be satisfied through the absorption of host tree tissues; so, using basic techniques, we examined the digestive capacities of workers from two species. We show that workers are able to degrade oligosaccharides and heterosides as well as, to a lesser degree, polysaccharides.

Our analysis of ovarian development & degree of mandible wear reveals that a temporal polyethism exists & that gynes perform the worker duty of digging galleries.  This is a new & previously unreported case of worker-like behavior in gynes.  These ants appear to follow a dynamic process wherein newly-inseminated gynes accepted by colonies perform worker-like tasks & do not produce eggs, until they have the opportunity to dominate their own section of the colony & become physogastric.  Workers that elude the queen's influence & produce chorioned, viable eggs probably play a role in the control of reproduction by nonphysogastric gynes.

In the myrmecophilic stage, our short-term experiment revealed a significant greater loss of young leaflets, when ants were excluded than on control plants to which ants had access.  The area of remaining leaf was not different between treatment & control.  Similar ambiguous effects were observed in the myrmecophytic stage.  A snapshot census revealed no significant difference in the standing level of leaf herbivore damage between branches with & without nesting ants.

    "abstract": "Discussion about thrips (Thysanoptera) as main pollinators has been controversial in the past because thrips do not fit the preconception of an effective pollinator. In this study, we present evidence for thrips pollination in the dioecious pioneer tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae). Macaranga hullettii is pollinated predominantly by one thrips species, Neoheegeria sp. (Phlaeothripidae, Thysanoptera). As a reward for pollinators, the protective floral bracteoles function as breeding sites for thrips and trichomal nectaries on the adaxial surface of the floral bracteoles provide alimentation. Flowering phenology of both staminate and pistillate trees was highly synchronized within 3-4 wk periods. In contrast to pistillate trees, staminate trees start to breed the thrips inside the developing inflorescences approximately 2 wk before anthesis. Breeding of Neoheegeria sp. in the laboratory indicates that the thrips development is completed within approximately 17 d. Thus, staminate trees offer breeding sites for one thrips generation until the onset of pollen presentation. Intraspecific pollen transfer by thrips was proved by pollen loads of thrips taken from receptive pistillate inflorescences of M. hullettii. Bagging experiments of different mesh sizes showed that seed set reached almost the level of open-pollinated flowers when exclusively tiny insects like thrips were able to enter the net bags, but no apomictic seed set occurred when no insect access was given to the flowers.          *[In trees with low seed set, the Crematogaster ant-partners had apparently destroyed at least some of the inflorescences.  Spot checks during the experiment revealed that Neoheegeria thrips indeed had entered the inflorescences bagged in coarse nets, and we never found any insect other than Neoheegeria thrips or the Crematogaster partner ant.]",

    "abstract": "The Oriental plant-ant genus Cladomyrma inhabits several host-plants of different families and orders, comprising trees and woody climbers in Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo. The colony founding queens chew holes into young plant internodes and hollow them out as nest cavities. Later, these initial nest chambers become enlarged by workers which excavate the twigs to provide shelter and substrate for brood and symbiotic Coccoidea (soft scales and mealy bugs). In Pen. Malaysia the tree Saraca thaipingensis (Caesalpiniaceae) is regularly inhabited by Cladomyrma petalae. Other Saraca species (S. declinata, S. indica, S. hulletti) are not colonized by Cladomyrma. The host-plant S. thaipingensis appears not to be a specialized ant-plant since it does not provide specialized structures for housing ants, such as swollen twigs or hollow stems with prostomata. However, it produces extrafloral nectaries on young leaves which attract many ants exept Cladomyrma. Nevertheless, the activity of C. petalae workers on the plant surface is concentrated on young plant tissue. Peliminary data suggest a reduced herbivore damage level on young Saraca leaves patrolled by Cladomyrma workers. C. petalae was also found nesting in sympatric woody climbers Strychnos vanprukii (Loganiaceae) and Spatholobus sp. (Fabaceae). Whereas only a fraction of the Strychnos population is inhabited by this plant-ant, Spatholobus lianas were never found without Cladomyrma. At an early developmental stage young Spatholobus climbers produce conspicuous internodal swellings (myrmecodomatia) which provide large stem diameters necessary for colony founding queens. In Pen. Malaysia and Borneo the genus Cladomyrma is known to inhabit many more host-plants: Millettia nieuwenhuisii (Fabaceae), Crypteronia griffithii (Crypteroniaceae) and Neonauclea spp. (at least 2 species; Rubiaceae). Recently, we found evidence that additional host-plants do occur in Flacourtiaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Rutaceae. Since the genus Cladomyrma occupies so many unrelated plant species we assume that host-switching has occured several times.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic associations between ants and plants often involve a third partner, scale insects (Hemiptera, Coccoidea). In southeast Asia, plant-ants of the genus Cladomyrma live together with coccoids in hollowed twigs of a wide range of ant-plants (myrmecophytes). Established colonies never lack sap-sucking scale insects and the ants appear to be dependent on the honeydew excretions of their trophobionts. Acquisition of scale insects thus seems to be an important step in the successful establishment of a new colony on a host plant. Coccoids may either be transported by a foundress ant on her nuptial flight (vertical transmission via co-dispersal) or ant and coccoid disperse on their own and associate anew during colony initiation (horizontal transmission). Here we test the assumption that founding gynes of Cladomyrma do not transport scale insects during their dispersal flight, and we determine when and how trophobionts are acquired. The results obtained in this study show that although coccoids are not carried by foundresses, their numbers within founding chambers of Cladomyrma increased with the founding stage. In all Cladomyrma species, colony-founding is claustral and the entrance hole into the nest chamber is first plugged with pith debris and later grows over by wound callus. However, access of trophobionts into hollow twigs is facilitated either by additional small openings (\u0018secondary slits\u0019) produced by the foundress ant after hollowing out a nest chamber or by the maintenance of an orifice at the entrance hole during the founding period. Immature pseudococcids experimentally placed onto twigs close to a Cladomyrma foundation readily entered these slits. Exclusion experiments suggest that foundresses of C. petalae are less successful in rearing their first offspring if entry of coccoids into founding chambers is prevented.          *[In the present study data were obtained from 7 (8) Cladomyrma species: C. andrei (Emery), C. aurochaetae Agosti, Moog & Maschwitz, C. crypteroniae Agosti, Moog & Maschwitz, C. dianeae Agosti, Moog & Maschwitz, C. hewitti (Wheeler), C. maschwitzi Agosti, C. petalae Agosti, & probably C. maryatiae Agosti, Moog & Maschwitz.

    "abstract": "Ants can have important, but sometimes unexpected, effects on the plants they associate with. For carnivorous plants, associating with ants may provide defensive benefits in addition to nutritional ones. We examined the effects of increased ant visitation and exclusion of insect prey from pitchers of the hooded pitcher plant Sarracenia minor, which has been hypothesized to be an ant specialist. Visitation by ants was increased by placing PVC pipes in the ground immediately adjacent to 16 of 32 pitcher plants, which created nesting/refuge sites. Insects were excluded from all pitchers of 16 of the plants by occluding the pitchers with cotton. Treatments were applied in a 2 x 2 factorial design in order to isolate the hypothesized defensive benefits from nutritional ones. We recorded visitation by ants, the mean number of ants captured, foliar nitrogen content, plant growth and size, and levels of herbivory by the pitcher plant mining moth Exyra semicrocea. Changes in ant visitation and prey capture significantly affected nitrogen content, plant height, and the number of pitchers per plant. Increased ant visitation independent of prey capture reduced herbivory and pitcher mortality, and increased the number of pitchers per plant. Results from this study show that the hooded pitcher plant derives a double benefit from attracting potential prey that are also capable of providing defense against herbivory.           *[Of the ants captured, the most abundant species (in descending order) are Crematogaster ashmeadi, Camponotus decipiens, & Odontomachus brunneus.

    "abstract": "Interactions between ants and ant\u0010plants are considered classic examples of obligate mutualisms. Previous studies have indicated that for many ant\u0010plants the loss of ant colonies results in severe defoliation or mortality. Although individual plants can persist for some period of time without their mutualistic partners, to date populations of ant\u0010free plants have only been recorded at high altitudes or on remote islands where herbivores are also scarce. We studied the interaction between ants, herbivores, and the ant\u0010plant Tococa guianensis in the Cerrado region of central Brazil. Using a survey conducted across a large geographic region, we show that there is interpopulation variation in ant occupancy across sites and habitats. At most sites surveyed, plants were inhabited by Allomerus octoarticulatus, an obligate plant\u0010ant. Plants with obligate ants had significantly lower standing levels of herbivore damage than plants with opportunistic ants and plants with no ant occupants. Furthermore, experimental removal of A. octoarticulatus resulted in increased levels of damage in both young and mature leaves. Despite the protection provided by obligate ants, populations of T. guianensis were found to persist without these ants in some areas. Plants without A. octoarticulatus had significantly greater leaf toughness and trichome density than those with A. octoarticulatus. Furthermore, trichome density in plants with A. octoarticulatus increased after ants were removed, probably as a response induced by increased levels of herbivore damage. To our knowledge, this is the first record of the occurrence of native myrmecophyte populations without their mutualistic ants in mainland low\u0010elevation sites. Several factors may help to explain the long\u0010term persistence of T. guianensis populations without plant\u0010ants in some areas of the Brazilian Cerrado, including its potential for induced morphological defenses against insect herbivores and selection for increased levels of constitutive defenses. In addition, T. guianensis may be under lower herbivore pressure in the sites we studied than in other parts of its range because existing populations were small, isolated, and some were very close to the edge of this species' distribution.",

Our main questions were: (1) do AGs have a particular pattern of vertical distribution on their host trees; (2) does a process of succession of epiphytes occur during development of AGs; and (3) are epiphytes segregated in AGs? LOCATION: Anthropic landscape in southeast Mexico. METHODS: We studied AGs built by Azteca gnava ants. We examined their vertical distribution on host trees as well as the diversity, composition and reproductive status of vascular epiphytes associated with the lower, middle and upper zones of small, medium and large AGs. RESULTS: A total of 859 AGs and 10 871 epiphytes, belonging to 26 different species, were recorded. We found that AGs are primarily (75%) located within tree crowns, and that the diversity and composition of epiphytes vary among AG sizes and among AG zones. We infer that the epiphytes that first become established in AGs are the bromeliad Aechmea tillandsioides and the gesneriad Codonanthe uleana, followed by the orchid Epidendrum flexuosum and the cactus Epiphyllum phyllanthus; these species were recorded, either individually or in co\u0010occurrence, in 74% of the AGs examined. The species Ae. tillandsioides, Coryanthes picturata and Epid. flexuosum were most frequent in the upper AG zone, while Epid. pachyrachis was most frequent in the middle AG zone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that AGs have distinct vertical distribution patterns on their tree hosts and that the establishment of epiphytes in AGs is successive and segregated, suggesting spatial and temporal optimization in the establishment and development of these complex mutualistic systems.",

Second, we ask under what conditions, the invasion of a third competitor into a two-species system. could alter the sensitivity of the system to environmental forcing at low vs. high frequency.

Consequently, adult resources may promote oviposition in sub-optimal locations when measured in terms of offspring performance. We tested whether oviposition site preference is primarily shaped by proximity to adult food resources or offspring performance in the aspen leaf miner (Phyllocnistis populiella). Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) produce extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) on a subset of their leaves. EFN expression on leaves is associated with decreased P. populiella damage and larval performance; however, P. populiella adults feed from EFNs. We reduced extrafloral nectar availability on entire aspen ramets and excluded crawling predators in a full factorial experiment at two sites in interior Alaska, USA. Patterns of egg deposition by P. populiella appeared to be primarily affected by offspring survival rather than adult resource availability. While oviposition was unaffected by nectar availability, adult moths laid fewer eggs on leaves with than without EFNs. By avoiding leaves with EFNs, moths increased offspring survival. Both moths and predators distinguished between leaves with and without EFNs even when nectar and visual cues were obscured, and therefore may respond to chemical cues associated with EFN expression.",

We determined that there were variations in nectaries among the three species, and that these may be linked to pollinator choice. Tillandsia seleriana Mez, which has a strict relationship with ants, had a nectary epithelium characterized by abundant dictyosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and a final degeneration stage possibly leading to holocrine secretion. The presence of protein crystals in epithelial plastids was correlated to a nectar enriched with amino acids and proteins, likely functioning to provide a protein-enriched diet and possibly defence against pathogens. Epithelial cells of the hummingbird-pollinated Tillandsia juncea (Ruiz et Pav.) Poir. nectary displayed cell wall ingrowths and dictyosomes and also contained cytoplasmic lipid droplets and protein crystals within plastids, both of which would enrich the nectar for hummingbirds.

Polycalic & polydomous nesting systems were recorded.  Large independent nests were positioned on the bark surface of trunks (50.8%) or the underside bark of the fork of large branches (49.2%) of cultivated or wild trees (45.8% & 54.2% respectively).  Workers collected nectar from 18 plants from 8 families: Asteraceae, Costaceae, Ehretiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Mimosaceae, Phyllantaceae, Poaceae, & Rutaceae.  They collected honeydew from Aleyrodidae & 4 Hemipteran families from suborder Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae, Coccidae, Pseudococcidae, & Stictococcidae.  These Hemipterans proliferated on 11 plant families: Anacardiaceae, Annonaceae, Apocynaceae, Asteraceae, Costaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Myrtaceae, Poaceae, Rutaceae, Solanaceae, & Urticaceae.  Solid particles brought back to the nest were mostly from plants (72.5%) & weak prey (27.5%).  Sugary liquids were preferred over fats, carbohydrate sources, & even prey.  Products were collected continuously (day & night) in the foliage of the host plant & neighboring plants, shrubs, & grasses.  Workers occasionally brought back to the nest dead or dying larvae of grasshoppers & small particles of other arthropods (ants, flies, caterpillars).  The sequence of behavioral acts recorded during the capture of larvae of Ruspolia differens (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) & adults of Zonocerus variegatus (Orthoptera: Pyrgomorphidae) (3 to 5 mm & 15 to 20 mm long respectively) were compared.  The main sequence showed succession of 7 acts: (1) detection by contact; (2) antennation; (3) attack-seizure; (4) short-range recruitment of nestmates in the vicinity; (5) spread-eagling of prey; (6) cutting up the prey on the spot; & (7) transport of pieces or whole prey to the nest.  The stinging phase was not recorded.  The duration of the capture of small prey was lower than that of large prey.  The long duration of capture suggested that spread-eagling & cutting up prey on the spot lasted a long time.  Cr. stadelmanni is a poor predator indirectly harmful for wild or cultivated trees, since their predatory aptitude is low compared to aggressive dominant arboreal-nesting ants, & is counter-balanced by it's preference for honeydew.]          *[Other species listed are considered dominant arboreal ants.]",

    "abstract": "Trophobiotic interactions occur when phytophagous insects provide a sugary liquid, the honeydew, for ants and obtain defence against predators or parasitoids. The plants may indirectly benefit from an increased ant foraging activity by reducing the herbivorous abundance. These three trophic interactions have been previously studied for several species, but mainly involving plants with extrafloral nectaries, which is a plant structure that also produce attractive substances for ants. Previous studies have reported an ant preference for honeydew over extrafloral nectary content. Therefore, trophobiosis can be an important mediator of ant-plant interactions. In this study, we describe a trophobiotic interaction between Edessa contermina stink bugs and Camponotus blandus ants on the Byrsonima verbascifolia plants occurring in a conservation area of Brazilian savanna. Stink bugs excreted a sugary liquid which was consumed by the ants, and C. blandus ants were observed consuming potential parasitoids. Stink bugs were more abundant in plants containing high food supply and shelter availability. The occurrence of ants depended of the number of inflorescences and trunk circumference of B. verbascifolia. Ant abundance, however, was positively correlated with stink bug abundance and the number of inflorescences. Herbivory was not explained by neither plant architecture nor ant abundance. This high ant activity may benefit plants from a protection against herbivory, but we did not detect this effect during the study period. Hence, the interaction among ants and plants was apparently commensal. We concluded that plant traits were important in ant attraction, but stink bugs foraging also increased ant activity on the plant, but mainly on inflorescences. Therefore, the plant may benefit from an increased defence of inflorescences rather than leaves.",

    "abstract": "Nectar larcenists extract nectar from flowers without pollinating them. A reasonable expectation is that any form of nectar larceny should have a detrimental effect on the plant\u0019s reproductive success. However, studies reveal an entire range of effects, from highly negative to highly positive. This variation in effect may be partly explained by additional, unmeasured, effects of nectar larcenists on plants. In a study system where two ant species Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabr.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and Trichomyrmex destructor (Jerd.) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) act as nectar larcenists, we examined the effect of larceny on the female reproductive success of Clerodendrum infortunatum Gaertn. (Lamiales: Lamiaceae) in rain forest fragments of the Western Ghats, India. This was done through a combination of field observations and a series of field experiments looking at the effects of excluding ants from inflorescences. We found that T. destructor reduces fruit set considerably. Rather than this being a consequence of nectar larceny, however, our experiments show that the negative effect arises instead from the herbivorous behavior of the ant. At a population level, both ant species prefer edges over interiors of forest patches, spatially concentrating the interaction zone to forest edges. Simultaneously considering multiple ecological interactions and disentangling their relative contributions might explain the large variation across species in the observed effect of larceny. The overall population effect of nectar larceny and herbivory is likely to depend on the spatial structuring of plants and ants.",

This study assessed the effects of a specialist aphid (Aphis echinaceae) on performance and foliar herbivore damage of a long-lived perennial plant (Echinacea angustifolia) native to the North American tallgrass prairie. A 2-year field experiment manipulating aphid infestation on 100 plants was compared with concurrent and past observations of unmanipulated plants in the same outdoor experimental plot. Because ants co-occur with aphids, the experiment tested the combined effects of aphids and ants.  3. Neither manipulated nor naturally-occurring aphid infestations led to measurable declines in plant performance. Results for foliar herbivore damage differed between experimental and observational studies: the occurrence of foliar herbivore damage decreased with aphid infestation in the first year of the experiment and increased with aphid infestation over 5\tyears in unmanipulated plants.  4. While the experimental results concur with other experiments of ant-hemipteran-herbivore relationships, the observational results suggest that ant-aphid interactions do not naturally play a major role in determining patterns of foliar herbivory in this system.

    "abstract": "The selection of nutrient-rich leaves by leaf-cutter ants (Atta spp.) is thought to be of indirect benefit to these ants by promoting the growth of their symbiotic fungus. However, relatively few studies have analyzed the influence of leaf nutrient content on host plant selection by leaf-cutter ants, and conflicting results have been found. We compared the content of eight nutritional elements plus the non-nutrient aluminum between leaves harvested by colonies of Atta laevigata (Smith) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Attini) and leaves collected randomly within their foraging areas. In addition, we evaluated whether leaf nutrient content explained the frequency with which these ants attacked and defoliated some of the tree species found in the study area. For 2 years, we monitored 17-26 trees from 15 species and determined the number of times each plant was attacked and the amount and type of foliage removed. Leaves harvested by A. laevigata presented significantly higher concentrations of N, P, K, Zn, and Cu than those collected randomly. This result is likely to reflect the foraging pattern presented by these ants, which were selective both in terms of the plant species and age of leaves most commonly attacked. Young leaves were the only or the main leaf type exploited in many species, and in comparison to mature leaves these presented significantly higher concentrations of P and K. Large differences in the mean number of ant attacks on the tree species studied were also observed, and those presenting more leaf N tended to be the most frequently attacked.",

Here, we investigate the phenological relationship between the butterfly E. bechina and its host plant C. brasiliense in the Brazilian cerrado savanna. Abundance of E. bechina immature stages followed the temporal pattern of leaf production by the host plant, with increased numbers in the beginning of the rainy season (September-November). Ant visitation to extrafloral nectaries of C. brasiliense also increased in the humid period, following the production of new leaves and flower buds. Ant abundance, however, apparently had no major effect on the temporal occurrence pattern of Eunica immatures on host plants. Nevertheless, recent data on antagonistic and mutualistic ant-butterfly interactions have revealed that ants do affect host plant choice by butterflies in the ant-rich cerrado savanna. Future investigation in insect seasonality in cerrados should take into account not only climate and plant phenology, but also direct and indirect effects at the ant-plant-herbivore interface.",

    "abstract": "*[In this study, first, we examined the mechanisms that maintained the high species-specificity in Macaranga-Crematogaster myrmecophytism.  As a key process that is involved in the mechanisms, we focused on settling-plant selection of the partner Macaranga seedlings by single foundress Crematogaster.  Field observation showed that foundress queens are able to select correctly their partner plant species, & that species-specificity is consequently through the settling-plant selection.  However, a number of Macaranga myrmecophytes were observed to be settled by foundress queens of non-partner ants, which settled into stem internodes of Macaranga seedings of sympatric Macaranga myrmecophytes species in the field.  This means that settling-plant selection by foundress queen is insufficient to maintain the high species-specificity.  Therefore, we hypothesized that the higher mortality in ant colonies & plants that are colonized by the ant species that are not specific to the plants might complementarily maintain the species-specificity.  Second, to test the hypothesis, we experimentally swapped the partner species of symbiont ants between the 3 Macaranga myrmecophyte species & monitored the survival rates of the plants & ant colonies.  The results support the hypothesis.  When queens of a ant species that is non-specific to a plant species were forced to colonize the seedlings of the plant, the mortality rates were significantly higher than those, when they colonized seedlings of the other plant species to which the ant species is specialized.  Third, to examine the intraspecific variation in the status of the ant-plant symbiosis among microhabitats of different light conditions, we investigated the species composition of nesting ants & the herbivory damage on M. bancana saplings by field observation & sampling in the primary & secondary forests in Sarawak.  In addition, the effectiveness of non-ant (physical & chemical) defenses were estimated by feeding the larvae of a polyphagous lepidopteran with M. bancana leaves from saplings in the 2 types of forests.  The results suggest that the symbiosis between ants & M. bancana is looser & the non-ant-defenses are stronger in secondary forests, where light is more intense, than in primary forests.]          *[Non-Crematogaster app. listed in Table 9 as ant colonies (11 colonies total) found in M. bancana saplings.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the obligate myrmecophytism between Macaranga ant-plants and Crematogaster plant-ants is highly species specific, although multiple Macaranga species can coexist in a microhabitat. However, the species specificity has been described based on the study of trees with established plant-ant colonies. We studied how the process of settling into the partner Macaranga seedlings by single foundress Crematogaster queens contributes to species specificity. By sampling seedlings of three sympatric Macaranga myrmecophytes species in the field, we tested two hypotheses. The first is that foundresses correctly select their specific partner plant species when they settle into seedlings. The second hypothesis is that the seasons in which seedlings available for settling by foundresses appear are segregated among the Macaranga species, and the seasons in which foundress queens settle are synchronized to the appearance of seedlings of specific partner species; thus species specificity is consequently generated. Our results support the former hypothesis but not the latter: we always observed foundresses settling species-specific host plants, and seedlings suitable for settling were always available in each Macaranga species.",

To examine the intraspecific variation in the status of the ant-plant symbiosis among microhabitats of different light conditions, we investigated the species composition of nesting ants and the herbivory damage on M. bancana saplings by field observations and sampling in primary and secondary forests in Sarawak. In addition, the effectiveness of non-ant (physical and chemical) defenses were estimated by feeding the larvae of a polyphagous lepidopteran with M. bancana leaves from saplings in the two types of forests. All saplings in the primary forest were colonized by two Crematogaster ant species that had been known to be the obligate symbionts of M. bancana, while in the secondary forest, about half of the saplings were occupied by several ant species that were not obligate symbionts. There was little herbivory damage on saplings colonized by the two Crematogaster symbiont ants in both forest types, while the saplings colonized by the other ant species suffered a 10-60% loss of leaf area. Larval mortality of the polyphagous lepidopteran Spodoptera litura was significantly higher when larvae fed on leaves of M. bancana saplings in the secondary forest than when fed on leaves of M. bancana saplings in the primary forest. These results suggest that the symbiosis between ants and M. bancana is looser and the non-ant-defenses are stronger in secondary forests, where light is more intense, than in primary forests.          *[Other species listed were found colonizing Macaranga bancana saplings in the secondary forest & tested for aggression.]",

We compared the productivity of the extrafloral nectaries present on leaves and inflorescences, as well as between day and night, and described the associated ant community. Nectar volume and concentration were higher in inflorescences than in leaves, and the rate of ant visitation was higher in inflorescences during the day. These results suggest congruence with the Optimal Defense Hypothesis. Nectar volume was generally greater during the night in both structures, but sugar concentration did not differ between day and night. We found a turnover in the ant species visiting C. rosea, with S. geminata being the most abundant species. The extrafloral nectar of C. rosea attracts several ant species and probably other arthropods, providing a valuable resource in a stressful system.",

This served as an evolutionary precursor to the use of plant-derived food sources, a dietary transition that likely preceded the evolution of extrafloral nectaries & elaiosomes.  Transitions to a strict, plant-derived diet occurred in the Cenozoic, & optimal models of shifts between strict predation & herbivory include omnivory as an intermediate step.  Arboreal nesting largely evolved from arboreally foraging lineages relying on a partially or entirely plant-based diet, & was initiated in the Mesozoic, preceding the evolution of domatia.  Previous work has suggested enhanced diversification in plants with specialized ant-associated traits, but it appears that for ants, living & feeding on plants does not affect ant diversification.

    "abstract": "Background Pollination drops and nectars (floral nectars) are secretions related to plant reproduction. The pollination drop is the landing site for the majority of gymnosperm pollen, whereas nectar of angiosperm flowers represents a common nutritional resource for a large variety of pollinators. Extrafloral nectars also are known from all vascular plants, although among the gymnosperms they are restricted to the Gnetales. Extrafloral nectars are not generally involved in reproduction but serve as 'reward' for ants defending plants against herbivores (indirect defence).  Scope Although very different in their task, nectars and pollination drops share some features, e.g. basic chemical composition and eventual consumption by animals. This has led some authors to call these secretions collectively nectar. Modern techniques that permit chemical analysis and protein characterization have very recently added important information about these sugary secretions that appear to be much more than a 'reward' for pollinating (floral nectar) and defending animals (extrafloral nectar) or a landing site for pollen (pollination drop).  Conclusions Nectar and pollination drops contain sugars as the main components, but the total concentration and the relative proportions are different. They also contain amino acids, of which proline is frequently the most abundant. Proteomic studies have revealed the presence of common functional classes of proteins such as invertases and defence-related proteins in nectar (floral and extrafloral) and pollination drops. Invertases allow for dynamic rearrangement of sugar composition following secretion. Defence-related proteins provide protection from invasion by fungi and bacteria. Currently, only few species have been studied in any depth. The chemical composition of the pollination drop must be investigated in a larger number of species if eventual phylogenetic relationships are to be revealed. Much more information can be provided from further proteomic studies of both nectar and pollination drop that will contribute to the study of plant reproduction and evolution.",

Because many ant species have been observed collecting the seeds, this interaction is often described as a generalized mutualism. Here, we combine fieldwork and meta-analyses to test this assumption. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that Aphaenogaster ants (predominantly A. rudis) collect approximately 74 +- 26% (mean +- SD) of the myrmecochorous seeds in eastern North American forests where any encounters with Aphaenogaster were reported, and approximately 61 +- 37% of the seeds in all the eastern forests where any seed collection has been monitored. This remarkable monopolization of seeds is due to at least two factors: 1) Aphaenogaster are significantly more likely to collect the ant-adapted seeds they discover than are ten other ant genera found in these forests and 2) the densities of Aphaenogaster and myrmecochorous plants are positively correlated at three nested spatial scales (within 20X20\u0005m patches, among patches within a forest, and among 41 forests in the eastern United States). Although other ants can collect seeds, our analyses demonstrate that A. rudis is the primary seed dispersal vector for most of this rich temperate ant-dispersed flora. The low levels of plant partner diversity for myrmecochores demonstrated here rivals that of tropical ant-plants (myrmecophytes) and well exceeds that typically observed in temperate plant-frugivore and plant-pollinator mutualisms and myrmecochory in other biomes.",

Pitfall trap catches of red wood ants did not vary significantly between the forest stand types, although some groups of other arthropods showed clear responses to stand type (e.g. catches of other Formicinae and Gnaphosidae were higher in sapling stands than in pole-stage stands). The number of red wood ants clearly explained less of the variation in assemblages of other ground-dwelling arthropods than the forest stand type.  3.  Red wood ant numbers decreased significantly with distance from the mounds, but the other ground-dwelling arthropods were insensitive to this gradient or even showed a preference for proximity to ant mounds and high ant activity.  4.

Once evolved, nectar secretion is never lost in Disholcaspis, consistent with high defensive value of this trait.  We also show that evolution of nectar secretion is correlated with a transition from solitary to aggregated oviposition, resulting in clustered nectar-secreting galls, which produce a resource that ants can more easily monopolize.  Such clustering is commonly seen in ant guard mutualisms.  We suggest that correlated evolution between maternal oviposition & larval nectar induction traits has enhanced the effectiveness of this gall defense strategy.]",

In addition to being largely temporally separated, ants rarely visited open inflorescences. A floral ant repellent contributes to the spatial separation of ants and inflorescences. In a field experiment, ants of four species were given equal access to inflorescences in different developmental stages. On average, the frequency with which ants made initial, antennal contact with the floral stages did not differ, but ants significantly avoided secondary contact with newly opened inflorescences relative to buds and old inflorescences, and old inflorescences relative to buds. Ants also avoided contact with pollen alone, indicating that pollen is at least one source of the repellent. The results suggest A. constricta has effectively resolved the potential conflict between visiting ants and plant reproduction.           *[Incorrectly labels Forelius pruinosus as Formica pruinosus in Fig. 3.]",

    "abstract": "QUESTIONS: Ants and rodents are recognized as ecosystem engineers worldwide creating soil\u0010modified nests and adjacent edges with superior resources. The influence of Dipodomys spectabilis (rat) and Pogonomyrmex rugosus (ant) on nests and edges would be similar in burned and unburned habitat on functional groups\u0019 cover, density, number of inflorescences and species number. We hypothesize that annual and perennial dicots would recover faster on rat patches than on burned grassland, dicots and grasses would recover faster on ant patches than on burned grassland, and annual dicots would recover faster on rat than on ant patches, whereas grasses would recover faster on ant than on rat patches. LOCATION: Semiarid grassland, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, USA. METHODS: We analyzed annual and perennial dicots, grasses and subshrubs in burned and unburned plots at 80 nests during cool\u0010 and warm\u0010seasons two years post\u0010fire. Data were collected at nest top (mound), edge, and 20 m (control) from the edge. RESULTS: Cover, density and species richness of different functional groups were low on animal mounds in unburned and burned plots. Ant edges had greater perennial dicot cover, grass cover and richness while rat edges had lower grass density and richness than control sites at unburned and burned plots. Perennial dicot density and richness recovered faster at rat mounds and edges than control. Ant edges yielded faster recovery of grass inflorescences than control. Dicots recovered faster on rat than ant mounds whereas grasses grew faster on ant edges. CONCLUSIONS: Rats create nests enhancing density of recovering dicots and ant edges facilitate reproduction of recovering grasses. Equal regeneration between animal nests and grassland occurred commonly when fire reduced grass competition. Dysochory, granivory and fire intensity may influence recovery. Nests may be sources of reestablishment and seed dispersal. Recovery of grassland may be amplified as plants infill from engineered nests.",

Harvest was significantly reduced in the fall relative to spring.  During preference experiments, harvest differences were found between grazing treatments for 2 of 4 species, but only during the spring.  High lipid content seeds were unpreferred in fall compared to high protein & carbohydrate content seeds.  Seeds in exclosures produced significantly more seedlings, than open arenas only during the first year of drought recovery.  Densities of grasses & annual forbs were higher in open arenas the second year, due to indirect effects of granivory.  By reducing seeds, ants release seedlings from competition.  Sown seedling abundance was unaffected by colony density & fire.  Colony density & distribution were influenced by topography, soil types, soil depth, & woody cover, but not by historical grazing treatments.  Cleared vegetation on nest disks impacted less than 1% of total surface area & losses were compensated by greater basal cover of grasses next to disks compared to surrounding habitats.

I studied different aspects of the trophic ecology Acromyrmex lobicornis and Acromyrmex striatus.  Both ant species actively forage from spring to autumn, but A. lobicornis is mostly noctunal, while A. striatus is exclusively diurnal.  In general, A. lobicornis forages at lower temperatures than A. striatus, & does not overlap in its optimal foraging temperatures, which might relate to differences in their thermal tolerance ranges or certain degree of avoidance to each other.  Both species show a generalist & opportunist diet, harvesting a high percentage of the available plants.  Diet composition & degree of selectivity mostly depends on seasonal & inter-annual variations of resource availability.  At the colony level, A. lobicornis harvests much more vegetation than A. striatus, though this difference can't be found at the population level, because A. striatus colonies are more abundant.  Each species can harvest 70-72 Kg/ha-year, or, among both of them, ~20% of primary productivity in the study area.  These ants also harvest a large amount of fruits & can act as seed dispersers.  In the case of the shrub Condalia microphylla, they not only move the seeds far away from the parental plant & towards favorable microsites, but also they cause the dispersed seeds to germinate more often & faster, than the seeds that were not manipulated by the ants.]",

    "abstract": "Information on direct and indirect drivers of temporal variation in ant\u0013plant interactions is scarce, compromising our ability to predict the functioning of these ecologically important interactions. We investigated the roles of precipitation, ant activity, abundance of young plant tissues bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and EFN phenotypes in the establishment of EFN\u0010mediated ant\u0013plant interactions throughout the year in Amazonia, Brazil. We hypothesized that the frequency of ant\u0013plant interactions follows a predictable seasonal pattern, being higher in wetter periods, during which plants invest more in the production of new plant tissues bearing EFNs, ultimately promoting ant attendance. We surveyed and tagged every understorey Bignonieae plant rooted inside 28,500\u0010m\u2264 plots, and recorded ant\u0013EFN interactions on each plant five times throughout the year. We also sampled ants with honey baits to estimate temporal variation in general ant activity. Contrary to our hypothesis, the proportion of plants tended by ants in each plot was higher in drier, not wetter, months. Ant attendance was indirectly and negatively related to precipitation, which was attributed to a decrease in the proportion of plants producing new EFN\u0010bearing plant tissues during the wetter period. Additionally, seasonal variation in an ant activity did not explain temporal patterns of plant attendance. At the plant level, ant attendance increased strongly with the number of recently formed shoot nodes, and ants almost never attended plants with limited or no young tissue. Among the 12 most abundant Bignonieae species, the amount of young tissue was the most important predictor of ant attendance, secondarily explained by the EFN secretory area. Synthesis. Our results suggest that seasonal variation in the production of new plant tissues bearing EFNs is the primary driver of the temporal patterns of EFN\u0013plant attendance by ants in this system. Contrary to our expectations, production of new plant tissue is higher in the drier months of the year, which in turn boosts the frequency of interactions between ants and EFN\u0010bearing plants in the dry season. These results highlight the role of plant phenology in the remarkable variation encountered in ant visitation to EFN\u0010bearing plants in both space and time.          *[A total of 33 species of ants distributed among 19 genera were recorded.

In this article, we evaluate the potential impact of EFNs (benefits and costs) on two species of plants from the dry areas of Central Brazil, Anemopaegma album and Anemopaegma scabriusculum (Bignoniaceae). In particular, we characterize the composition of substances secreted by the EFNs, test whether EFNs attract ants, and whether ants actually present a defensive role, leading to reduced herbivory and increased plant fitness. Histochemical analyses indicated that EFNs from both species of Anemopaegma secrete an exudate that is composed of sugars, and potentially lipids and proteins. Furthermore, EFNs from both species were shown to present a significant role in ant attraction. However, contrary to common expectations, ants were not found to protect plants against herbivore attack. No effect was found between ant visitation and flower or fruit production in A. album, while the presence of ants led to a significant decrease in flower production in A. scabriusculum. These results suggest that EFNs might present a similar cost and benefit in A. album, and a higher cost than benefit in A. scabriusculum. Since the ancestor of Anemopaegma occupied humid forests and already presented EFNs that were maintained in subsequent lineages that occupied savannas, we suggest that phylogenetic inertia might explain the presence of EFNs in the species of Anemopaegma in which EFNs lack a defensive function.",

As part of our examination of non-ant defences, we measured leaf toughness (punch strength, by penetrometry), and the contents of total phenols and condensed tannin. We demonstrated interspecific variation in intensities of both ant and non-ant defences amongst ten Macaranga species and showed that the rank order of ant defence intensity was negatively correlated with the intensity of non-ant defence. We also found that the balance between ant and non-ant defence intensity was correlated with the rates of leaf turnover and shoot growth. Species investing more in ant defence tended to have higher leaf turnover rates. Macaranga species that occur preferentially in shadier microhabitats had lower leaf turnover rates, suggesting that non-ant defences are more cost-effective in more shade-tolerant species.

D. discolor seed without food bodies are not attractive to ants and remain beneath the parent canopy. At Nude Wash, California, USA, diaspore removal distances are generally small, averaging 2.3 m away from the nearest D. discolor canopy in March-May 1977. Two lines of evidence indicate that this limited transport has a large effect on seed detection and utilization by rodents: (1) seeds placed in ant-proof dishes beneath the D. discolor canopy were about 10 times more likely to be removed by nocturnally foraging rodents than seeds placed in locations similar to those where ants locate their nests; (2) using D. discolor as bait, significantly more rodents were trapped beneath the plant canopy than in open areas where seeds were transported by ants. Manipulation of the density of D. discolor seed in these tests suggests that seed utilization by rodents is distance-responsive to the parent canopy rather than dependent on the density of seeds. Disapore analyses indicate that investment in the transport system is relatively small and represents <5% of the total investment in seeds.",

However, ants may provide additional services.

From 30 reported species combinations, we found that the presence of ants lead to reduced pathogen levels in 18 combinations and to increased levels in 6. On average, ants significantly reduced pathogen incidence with 59%. This effect size did not differ significantly from effect sizes reported from meta\u0010analyses on herbivore protection. Thus, pathogen and herbivore protection could be of equal importance in ant-plant mutualisms. Considering the abundance of these interactions, ecological impacts are potentially high. Furthermore, awareness of this service may stimulate the development of new measures to control plant diseases in agriculture. It should be noted, though, that studies were biased toward tropical ant-plant symbioses and that the literature in the field is limited at present. Future research on plant pathogens is needed to enhance our understanding of ant-plant mutualisms and their evolution.",

In food\u0010for\u0010protection interactions between ants and extrafloral nectar (EFN)\u0010bearing plants, tending by aggressive ants may deter herbivores, but it may also deter pollinators. The fitness costs of pollinator deterrence are not straightforward for long\u0010lived iteroparous plants, because reproductive vital rates often contribute weakly to fitness relative to growth and survival (vital rates that may be enhanced by ant defense). We used field manipulations of ant and pollinator activity and demographic modeling to examine how pollination costs of ant defense translate to plant fitness, given the benefits of ant defense elsewhere in the plant life cycle. We contrasted the net fitness effects of alternative ant partner species. Our work focused on the tree cholla cactus, Opuntia imbricata, an EFN\u0010bearing plant associated with two ant species (Crematogaster opuntiae and Liometopum apiculatum) that differ in quality of defense against insect herbivores. We found that ant defense imposed pollination costs, despite evidence for ant\u0010repellent floral volatiles and temporal partitioning of ant and pollinator activity. The two partner species similarly reduced pollinator visitation and seed mass, and one (C. opuntiae) additionally reduced seed number. We used the experimental data and other long\u0010term demographic data to parameterize an integral projection model that integrated costs and benefits of ant defense over the complete plant life cycle. Model results indicated that the pollination costs of L. apiculatum were balanced by beneficial effects on growth, leading to a net fitness effect that was neutral to positive. By contrast, pollination costs outweighed benefits for C. opuntiae, the weaker defender, rendering this species a reproductive parasite. Thus, we infer that pollination costs destabilize mutualism with one partner species, but are offset by strong defensive benefits provided by the other, leading to contrasting selective pressures imposed by alternative associations. Accounting for ontogenetic turnover in ant partner identity indicated that most plants avoid the parasitic effects of C. opuntiae by associating nonrandomly with L. apiculatum at reproductive life stages. Our results highlight the value of a demographic approach to quantifying the costs and benefits of mutualism.",

A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with >150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with <50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15% of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities.",

The study was conducted in Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco, Brazil.  We established nineteen 50X20 m plots that encompassed gradients of both chronic anthropogenic disturbance & aridity.  We offered diaspores of 6 plant species, 3 myrmecochorous diaspores & 3 fleshy fruits that are secondarily dispersed by ants.  We then quantified the number of interactions, seed removal rate, & dispersal distances, noting the identities of interacting ant species.  Finally, we used pitfall trap data to quantify the abundances of ant disperser species in each plot.  Our results show that overall composition of ant disperser species varied along the gradients of chronic anthropogenic disturbance & aridity, but the composition of high\u0010quality dispersers varied only with aridity.  The total number of interactions, rates of removal, & mean distance of removal all declined with increasing aridity, but they were not related to chronic anthropogenic disturbance.  These same patterns were found when considering only high\u0010quality disperser species, driven by the responses of the dominant disperser Dinoponera quadriceps.

    "abstract": "Most terrestrial species occur in human\u0010modified landscapes that are experiencing climate change. In addition to direct impacts on species, both anthropogenic disturbance and climate change can have important effects through changes in species interactions, including the disruption of ecological services provided by them. Here we investigate how chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) and aridity affect the effectiveness of plant protection services provided by ants to plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). The study was conducted across 13 01\u0010ha plots distributed along CAD and aridity gradients in Caatinga vegetation of northeastern Brazil. We focused on Pityrocarpa moniliformis, the most abundant and widely distributed EFN\u0010bearing tree species occurring in our study area, and we used experimental attack rates on termites as a measure of effectiveness of ant protection services. We investigated the relative roles of nectar production (volume and concentration) and ant species composition in mediating the effects of CAD and aridity on the effectiveness of protection services. Attack rates by ants declined with increasing aridity but were not related to CAD. The volume of extrafloral nectar declined with increasing CAD but was not affected by aridity, whereas the concentration was not related to either CAD or aridity. The composition of attendant ant species varied with aridity but not with CAD. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that CAD does not affect plant\u0010protection services mediated by EFNs in Brazilian Caatinga. However, ant\u0010protection services declined with increased aridity, and this occurred through changes in the composition of attendant ant species rather than by changes in the production of extrafloral nectar. Such a response to increasing aridity highlights the vulnerability of EFN\u0010bearing plants to climate change through decreased predation of herbivores.          *[We observed 238 interactions involving 16 ant species attending P. moniliformis EFNs.  Camponotus crassus occurred in all plots, & C. crassus & Cephalotes pusillus were the most frequent ant species attending EFNs, involved in 40.7% of all interactions.]",

    "abstract": "Global expansion of secondary forests results from old-growth forest conversion to agriculture and livestock fields, followed by abandonment. Dry forests heavily rely on resprouting for rapid biomass recovery, but some species depend on seed dispersers. Ants are important seed dispersers in dry forests, as they can transport seeds over long distances, help species join the soil seed bank, and promote seed germination and seedling recruitment. We investigated seed-dispersing ant community, ant-seed interactions, and seed removal rates and distances along a Caatinga dry forest secondary succession using forest stands (8\u001354 years) after slash-and-burn agriculture and old-growth forest stands. We observed 796 interactions with 29 ant species and four plant species. About 26.51% were removals by 12 ant species, notably Dinoponera quadriceps and Ectatomma muticum, dispersing seeds up to 15 m. Only 14% of removed seeds reached nests while the rest were lost along foraging trails. Ant abundance of seed-dispersing ant community increased significantly with forest aboveground biomass, and both ant abundance and richness were significantly higher in secondary forest stands. Ant-seed interactions increased with biomass, being higher in old-growth forests. However, ant community composition, removal rates, and dispersal distances remained consistent across biomass and forest types. These findings may suggest that ant-mediated seed dispersal service quickly recovers during secondary succession, with implications for the dynamics of forest regeneration, given that ant-mediated seed dispersal is a prevalent and widespread phenomenon in the Caatinga dry forest.",

Frequency of ant occupancy and mean number of ants per plant were much higher on Qualea than on plants lacking extrafloral nectaries.

    "abstract": "In ant\u0013plant mutualisms mediated by plant-based liquid resources (e.g., extrafloral and pericarpial nectar), third-party exploiters are often present. Usually, the costs of having exploiters species seem to have little to no effect on ant\u0013plant mutualistic interaction. However, little is known about how and to what extent exploiters affect mutualistic interactions. In this study, we evaluated the cascading effects of Rhinoleucophenga myrmecophaga (Diptera) predatory larvae on the outcomes of the interaction between mutualistic ants and a pericarpial nectary (PN)-bearing plant, Cordiera elliptica (Rubiaceae). In a manipulative experiment controlling for the presence of ants and/or predatory larvae, we evaluated arthropods and larvae, plant fitness, and pericarpial nectar production. We found that: (a) the presence of larvae decreased ant abundance by 50% resulting in an increase of arthropod number by 38%; (b) the absence of ants negatively influenced larva development and survival; (c) fruits with larvae and without ants had lower volume and weight, fewer viable seeds, and a higher parasitism rate; and (d) the pericarpial nectar sugar concentration is higher in plants with larvae and without ants. We showed that the outcomes of the multitrophic relationship between ants, R. myrmecophaga larvae, and an PN-bearing plant led to costly cascading effects on this mutualistic relationship. This interaction can range from negative to positive, in which the predatory fly larvae directly and indirectly influence ants number and behavior, and consequently the plant fitness.",

    "abstract": "Most studies aiming to determine the beneficial effect of ants on plants simply consider the effects of the presence or exclusion of ants on plant yield. This approach is often inadequate, however, as ants interact with both non-tended herbivores and tended Homoptera.  Moreover, the interaction with these groups of organisms is dependent on ant density, and these functional relationships are likely to be non-linear. A model is presented here that segregates plant herbivores into two categories depending on the sign of their numerical response to ants (myrmecophiles increase with ants, non-tended herbivores decline). The changes in these two components of herbivores with increasing ant density and the resulting implications for ant-plant mutualisms are considered. It emerges that a wide range of ant densities needs to be considered as the interaction sign (mutualism or parasitism) and strength is likely to change with ant density. The model is used to interpret the results of an experimental study that varied levels of Aphis fabae infestation and Lasius niger ant attendance on Vicia faba bean plants. Increasing ant density consistently reduced plant fitness and thus, in this location, the interaction between the ants and the plant can be considered parasitic. In the Vicia faba system, these costs of ants are unlikely to be offset by other beneficial agents (e.g., parasitoids), which also visit extrafloral nectaries.",

Here, we use a phylogenetic approach to identify ecological factors that explain macroevolutionary trends in the mutualism between ants and honeydew-producing Homoptera. We also consider association between ant-Homoptera, ant-fungi and ant-plant mutualisms. Homoptera-tending ants are more likely to be forest dwelling, polygynous, ecologically dominant and arboreal nesting with large colonies of 104-105 individuals. Mutualistic ants (including those that garden fungi and inhabit ant-plants) are found in under half of the formicid subfamilies. At the genus level, however, we find a negative association between ant-Homoptera and ant-fungi mutualisms, whereas there is a positive association between ant-Homoptera and ant-plant mutualisms. We suggest that species can only specialize in multiple mutualisms simultaneously when there is no trade-off in requirements from the different partners and no redundancy of rewards.          *[The genera selected [139 of a possible 288 extant described genera (Moreau et al., 2006)] were those used by Moreau et al.

    "abstract": "Myrmecophytic symbioses are widespread in tropical ecosystems and their diversity makes them useful tools for understanding the origin and evolution of mutualisms. Obligate ant-plants, or myrmecophytes, provide a nesting place, and, often, food to a limited number of plant-ant species. In exchange, plant-ants protect their host plants from herbivores, competitors and pathogens, and can provide them with nutrients. Although most studies to date have highlighted a similar global pattern of interactions in these systems, little is known about the temporal structuring and dynamics of most of these associations. In this study we focused on the association between the understory myrmecophyte Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae) and its obligate ant partner Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae). An examination of the life histories and growth rates of both partners demonstrated that this plant species has a much longer lifespan (up to about 350 years) than its associated ant colonies (up to about 21 years). The size of the ant colonies and their reproductive success were strongly limited by the available nesting space provided by the host plants. Moreover, the resident ants positively affected the vegetative growth of their host plant, but had a negative effect on its reproduction by reducing the number of flowers and fruits by more than 50%. Altogether our results are important to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of ant-plant symbioses. The highly specialized interaction between long-lived plants and ants with a shorter lifespan produces an asymmetry in the evolutionary rates of the interaction which, in return, can affect the degree to which the interests of the two partners converge.",

The use of the galleries represents an innovative prey capture strategy compared with the more typical strategy of foraging on leaves.  However, because of a limited worker force in their colonies, the prey capture behavior of the ants results in a trade-off between plant protection (i.e. the ants patrol the foliage & attack intruders including herbivores) & ambushing prey in the galleries, which has a cascading effect on the fitness of all of the partners.  The quantification of partners' traits & effects showed that the 2 ant species differed in their mutualistic investment.  Less investment in the galleries (i.e. in fungal cultivation) translated into more benefits for the plant in terms of less herbivory & higher growth rates & vice versa.  However, the greater vegetative growth of the plants did not produce a positive fitness effect for the better mutualistic ant species in terms of colony size & production of sexuals nor was the mutualist compensated by the wider dispersal of its queens.  As a consequence, although the better ant mutualist is the one that provides more benefits to its host plant, its lower host-plant exploitation does not give this ant species a competitive advantage.  The local coexistence of the ant species is thus fleeting & should eventually lead to the exclusion of the less competitive species.]",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant mutualisms are useful models for investigating how plant traits mediate interspecific interactions. As plant\u0010derived resources are essential components of ant diets, plants that offer more nutritious food to ants should be better defended in return, as a result of more aggressive behavior toward natural enemies. We tested this hypothesis in a field experiment by adding artificial nectaries to individuals of the species Vochysia elliptica (Vochysiaceae). Ants were offered one of four liquid foods of different nutritional quality: amino acids, sugar, sugar + amino acids, and water (control). We used live termites (Nasutitermes coxipoensis) as herbivore competitors and observed ant behavior toward them. In 88 hr of observations, we recorded 1,009 interactions with artificial nectaries involving 1,923 individual ants of 26 species. We recorded 381 encounters between ants and termites, of which 38% led to attack. Sixty\u0010one percent of these attacks led to termite exclusion from the plants. Recruitment and patrolling were highest when ants fed upon nectaries providing sugar + amino acids, the most nutritious food. This increase in recruitment and patrolling led to higher encounter rates between ants and termites, more frequent attacks, and faster and more complete termite removal. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that plant biotic defense is mediated by resource quality. We highlight the importance of qualitative differences in nectar composition for the outcome of ant-plant interactions.

    "abstract": "Many neotropical ants form mutualistic associations with myrmecophytes, receiving shelter and/or food in exchange for protection. However, our knowledge about their natural history is still unclear. Here, we investigate the natural history of ant Pseudomyrmex concolor that nests inside the foliar rachis of Tachigali myrmecophila (Fabaceae). We describe the nest architecture, colony structure and rhythm activity of P. concolor in the Brazilian Amazon. We found P. concolor nests exclusively in T. myrmecophila. Its colony is established by claustral foundation with an independent queen, which remains the colony's only egg-laying. The nest of P. concolor is a hollow tubular construction of the swollen leaf petiole that constitutes the domatia of T. myrmecophila. The colony structure of P. concolor (eggs, larvae, pupae and adults) depends on plant traits, such as plant height, number of leaves and internal space of the domatia. Tachigali myrmecophila does not provide food for P. concolor, and the mealybugs are their only food source. Pseudomyrmex concolor has a bimodal cycle of activity, patrolling its host plant for 24 h a day and throughout the year, mainly during the Amazonian rainy season nights. Humidity and temperature are environmental factors that can explain much of the variation in the rhythm of this ant species daily activity, but not the change between the seasons. Our findings improve the knowledge of ant-plant mutualisms and eco-evolutionary studies on tropical forests.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims: The occurrence of nectaries in fruits is restricted to a minority of plant families and consistent reports of their occurrence are not found associated with Fabaceae, mainly showing cellular details. The present study aims to describe the anatomical organization and ultrastructure of the pericarpial nectaries (PNs) in Erythrina speciosa, a bird-pollinated species, discussing functional aspects of these unusual structures.  Methods: Samples of floral buds, ovaries of flowers at anthesis and fruits at several developmental stages were fixed and processed by the usual methods for studies using light, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Nectar samples collected by filter paper wicks were subjected to chemical analysis using thin-layer chromatography.  Key Results: The PNs are distributed in isolation on the exocarp. Each PN is represented by a single hyaline trichome that consists of a basal cell at epidermal level, stalk cell(s) and a small secretory multicellular head. The apical stalk cell shows inner periclinal and anticlinal walls impregnated by lipids and lignin and has dense cytoplasm with a prevalence of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. The secretory cells show voluminous nuclei and dense cytoplasm, which predominantly has dictyosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, plastids, mitochondria and free ribosomes. At the secretory stage the periplasmic space is prominent and contains secretion residues. Tests for sugar indicate the presence of non-reducing sugars in the secretory cells. Nectar samples from PNs contained sucrose, glucose and fructose.  Conclusions: The secretory stage of these PNs extends until fruit maturation and evidence suggests that the energetic source of nectar production is based on pericarp photosynthesis. Patrolling ants were seen foraging on fruits during all stages of fruit development, which suggests that the PNs mediate a symbiotic relationship between ants and plant, similar to the common role of many extrafloral nectaries.",

Therefore, to determine the distribution and structural aspects of EFNs, Cedrela fissilis Vell. leaves in different stages of development were collected, fixed, and processed for light and scanning electron microscopy. On the petiole, rachis and petiolule, EFNs were found to be arranged predominantly towards the abaxial surface, while their occurrence in leaflet blades was restricted to the abaxial surface of the major veins, noticeably on the midrib. Basal leaflets displayed few EFNs; however, we observed an increase towards the leaf's apex. The leaf can contain more than 300 inconspicuous EFNs, which show secretory activity throughout the leaf's life. Two EFN morphotypes were visible: flattened or elevated, both circular or slightly elliptical and similar in origin and tissue composition. The secretory tissue is embedded in the rachis cortex or in the major veins of the leaf blade and EFNs are not vascularized. The EFN secretory pole shows a uniseriate epidermis with compactly arranged cells and a thin cuticle; stomata and trichomes are absent. The observation of ant visits at these structures reinforces the assumption that EFNs mediate ant-plant interactions and play a protective role against herbivores throughout the life of a leaf.          *[The presence of Camponotus rufipes Fabricius ants was detected in C. fissilis leaves during field observations, but their visiting frequency was not quantified in this study.]",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims The distinction between pearl bodies (or pearl glands) and food bodies (FBs) is not clear; neither is our understanding of what these structures really represent. The present work examined the ontogenesis, structure, ultrastructure and histochemical aspects of the protuberances in Cissus verticillata, which have been described since the beginning of the 19th century as pearl glands or pearl bodies, in order to establish a relationship between their structure and function.  Methods Segments of stems and leaves in different stages of development were collected and fixed for study under light microscopy as well as electron transmission and scanning microscopy. Samples of FBs were subjected to chemical analysis using thin-layer chromatography.  Key Results The FBs in C. verticillata are globose and attached to the plant by a short peduncle. These structures are present along the entire stem during primary growth, and on the inflorescence axis and the abaxial face of the leaves. The FBs were observed to be of mixed origin, with the participation of both the epidermis and the underlying parenchymatic cells. The epidermis is uniseriate with a thin cuticle, and the cells have dense cytoplasm and a large nucleus. The internal parenchymatic cells have thin walls; in the young structures these cells have dense cytoplasm with a predominance of mitochondria and plastids. In the mature FBs, the parenchymatic cells accumulate oils and soluble sugars; dictyosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum predominate in the cytoplasm; the vacuoles are ample. Removal of the FBs appears to stimulate the formation of new ones, at the same place.  Conclusions The vegetative vigour of the plant seems to influence the number of FBs produced, with more vigorous branches having greater densities of FBs. The results allow the conclusion that the structures traditionally designated pearl glands or pearl bodies in C. verticillata constitute FBs that can recruit large numbers of ants.          *[The most frequent insect visitors were the ants Camponotus rengerri, Camponotus sp., Crematogaster sp., & Pachychondyla sp., which were observed carrying intact food bodies, apparently taking them back to their colonies.

    "abstract": "Spatial mosaics in resource productivity may facilitate competitive coexistence when species differ in their ability to exploit resource\u0010rich vs. resource\u0010poor conditions. In this study, I investigated the influence of a termite\u0010generated spatial mosaic in resource productivity on the dynamics of competition and coexistence in a guild of four acacia ants that reside on Acacia drepanolobium. Near termite mounds, both new shoot production of A. drepanolobium and densities of litter\u0010dwelling invertebrates (an important food source of the acacia ants) are higher than in \u001cmatrix\u001d habitats between mounds. This resource variation is spatially correlated with the outcome of competition among acacia ants for host trees; near the mounds, competitively dominant species are more likely to supplant subordinates, whereas the likelihood of subordinates replacing dominants on host trees increases with distance from mounds. Variation in competitive outcomes among patch types appears to result from differential responses among acacia ant species to resource heterogeneity. Analysis of average tissue \u00a5\u03c0uN levels indicated that acacia ant colonies near termite mounds had higher ratios of animal prey in their diets than colonies in matrix areas. Bait trials and analysis of average nest size in mound and matrix habitats suggest that competitively dominant species are disproportionately successful in exploiting higher prey densities near termite mounds. Increased dietary uptake of nitrogen\u0010rich prey may fuel more rapid colony growth in competitively dominant acacia ants, resulting in more pronounced asymmetries in colony size between dominant and subordinate species in mound areas. Because colony size asymmetry is a key determinant of interspecific competitive outcomes, colonies of subordinate species near termite mounds may be more vulnerable to aggressive take\u0010overs by dominants. In lower\u0010productivity matrix habitats, increased tolerance to low\u0010resource conditions may afford subordinate species greater persistence. Overall, these results suggest that termite\u0010induced habitat heterogeneity plays a significant role in the dynamics of the acacia ant community, and may contribute to species coexistence in this intensely competitive community.",

We studied ant aggression, damage by herbivores and seed predators, and fruit production among Acacia drepanolobium trees occupied by four different acacia\u0010ant species in an East African savanna. Levels of ant aggression in response to experimental disturbance differed strongly among the four species. All four ant species recruited more strongly to new leaf growth on host plants following disturbance, while recruitment to developing fruits was on average an order of magnitude lower. Host plants occupied by more aggressive ant species suffered significantly less vegetative damage from leaf\u0010feeding insects, stem\u0010boring beetles, and vertebrate browsers than host plants occupied by less aggressive ant species. However, there were no differences among fruiting host plants occupied by different ant species in levels of seed predation by bruchid seed predators.

    "abstract": "Understanding how cooperative interactions evolve and persist remains a central challenge in biology. Many mutualisms are thought to be maintained by \"partner fidelity feedback\", in which each partner bases their investment on the benefits they receive. Yet, we know little about how benefits change as mutualists vary their investment, which is critical to understanding the balance between mutualism and antagonism in any given partnership. Using an obligate ant-plant mutualism, we manipulated the density of symbiotic acacia ants (Crematogaster mimosae) and examined how the costs and benefits to Acacia drepanolobium trees scaled with ant abundance. Benefits of ants to plants saturated with increasing ant abundance for protection from branch browsing by elephants and attack by branch galling midges, while varying linearly for protection from cerambycid beetles. In addition, the risk of catastrophic whole\u0010tree herbivory by elephants was highest for trees with very low ant abundance. However, there was no relationship between ant abundance and herbivory by leaf\u0010feeding invertebrates, nor by vertebrate browsers such as giraffe, steinbuck, and Grant's gazelle. Ant abundance did not significantly influence rates of branch growth on acacias, but there was a significant negative relationship between ant abundance and the number of fruits produced by host plants, suggesting that maintaining high\u0010density ant colonies is costly. Because benefits to plants largely saturated with increasing colony size, while costs to plant reproduction increased, we suggest that ant colonies may achieve abundances that are higher than optimal for host plants. Our results highlight the conflicts of interest inherent in many mutualisms, and demonstrate the value of examining the shape of curves relating costs and benefits within these globally important interactions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cooperation is a central challenge in biology, because natural selection should favor \"free-loaders\" that reap benefits without reciprocating. For interspecific cooperation (mutualism), most approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial partners. However, natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and most mutualists, particularly longer-lived species interacting with shorter-lived partners (e.g., corals and zooxanthellae, tropical trees and mycorrhizae) interact with multiple partner species throughout ontogeny. Determining how multiple partnerships might interactively affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. The tropical tree Acacia drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose short-term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic. Using a long-term dataset, we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a tree. These sets include a \"sterilization parasite\" that prevents reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship. Trees associating with partner sets that include these \"parasites\" enhance lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different life stages. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating mutualism within a community context and suggest that lifespan inequalities among mutualists may help cooperation persist in the face of exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant protection symbioses, in which plants provide food and/or shelter for ants in exchange for protection from herbivory, are model systems for understanding the ecology of mutualism. While interactions between ants, host plants, and herbivores have been intensively studied, we know little about how plant-plant interactions influence the dynamics of these mutualisms, despite strong evidence that plants compete for resources, that hosting ants can be costly, and that host\u0010plant provisioning to ants can therefore be constrained by resource availability. We used field experiments in a semiarid Kenyan savanna to examine interactions between the ant\u0010plant Acacia drepanolobium, neighboring grasses, and two species of symbiotic acacia\u0010ants with divergent behaviors: Crematogaster mimosae, an aggressive symbiont that imposes high costs to host trees via consumption of extrafloral nectar, and Tetraponera penzigi, a less\u0010protective symbiont that imposes lower costs because it does not consume nectar. We hypothesized that by competing with acacias for resources, neighboring grasses (1) reduce hosts' ability to support costly C. mimosae, while having little or no effect on the ability of hosts to support low\u0010cost T. penzigi, and (2) reduce sapling growth rates irrespective of ant occupant. We factorially manipulated the presence/absence of grasses and the identity of ant occupants on saplings and evaluated effects on colony survivorship and sapling growth rates over 40 weeks. Contrary to prediction, the high\u0010cost/high\u0010reward nectar\u0010dependent mutualist C. mimosae had higher colony\u0010survival rates on saplings with grass neighbors present. Grasses appear to have indirectly facilitated the survival of C. mimosae by reducing water stress on host plants; soils under saplings shaded by grasses had higher moisture content, and these saplings produced more active nectaries than grass\u0010removal saplings. Consistent with prediction, survival of low\u0010cost/low\u0010reward T. penzigi did not differ significantly between grass\u0010removal treatments. Saplings occupied by low\u0010cost/low\u0010reward T. penzigi grew 100% more on average than saplings occupied by high\u0010cost/high\u0010reward C. mimosae, demonstrating that mutualist\u0010partner identity strongly and differentially influences demographic rates of young plants. In contrast, contrary to prediction, grass neighbors had no significant net impact on sapling growth rates. Our results suggest that neighboring plants can exert strong and counterintuitive effects on ant-plant protection symbioses, highlighting the need to integrate plant-plant interactions into our understanding of these mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions can lead to the reassembly of communities and understanding and predicting the impacts of exotic species on community structure and functioning are a key challenge in ecology. We investigated the impact of a predatory species of invasive ant, Pheidole megacephala, on the structure and function of a foundational mutualism between Acacia drepanolobium and its associated acacia\u0010ant community in an East African savanna. Invasion by P. megacephala was associated with the extirpation of three extrafloral nectar\u0010dependent Crematogaster acacia ant species and strong increases in the abundance of a competitively subordinate and locally rare acacia ant species, Tetraponera penzigi, which does not depend on host plant nectar. Using a combination of long\u0010term monitoring of invasion dynamics, observations and experiments, we demonstrate that P. megacephala directly and indirectly facilitates T. penzigi by reducing the abundance of T. penzigi\u0019s competitors (Crematogaster spp.), imposing recruitment limitation on these competitors, and generating a landscape of low\u0010reward host plants that favor colonization and establishment by the strongly dispersing T. penzigi. Seasonal variation in use of host plants by P. megacephala may further increase the persistence of T. penzigi colonies in invaded habitat. The persistence of the T. penzigi\u0013A. drepanolobium symbiosis in invaded areas afforded host plants some protection against herbivory by elephants (Loxodonta africana), a key browser that reduces tree cover. However, elephant damage on T. penzigi\u0010occupied trees was higher in invaded than in uninvaded areas, likely owing to reduced T. penzigi colony size in invaded habitats. Our results reveal the mechanisms underlying the disruption of this mutualism and suggest that P. megacephala invasion may drive long\u0010term declines in tree cover, despite the partial persistence of the ant\u0013acacia symbiosis in invaded areas.",

    "abstract": "Determining how competing species coexist is essential to understanding patterns of biodiversity. Indirect facilitation, in which a competitively dominant species exerts a positive effect on one competitor by more strongly suppressing a third, shared competitor, is a potentially potent yet understudied mechanism for competitive coexistence. Here we provide evidence for indirect facilitation in a guild of four African Acacia ant species that compete for nesting space on the host plant Acacia drepanolobium, showing that a competitively dominant acacia ant species indirectly creates establishment opportunities for the most subordinate species that may help to maintain diversity. Using long\u0010term observational data and field experiments, we demonstrate that the competitively dominant ant species outcompetes two competitively intermediate species, while tolerating colonies of the subordinate competitor; this creates opportunities for local colonization and establishment of colonies of the subordinate species within the dominant species\u0019 territories. Host plants occupied by this subordinate species are then more likely to be colonized by the intermediate species, which in turn are more likely to be displaced by the dominant species. This process has the potential to generate a cyclical succession of ant species on host trees, contributing to stable coexistence within this highly competitive community.",

Most of the epiphytes are planted by ants; therefore, seed selection by ants is a key driver of the epiphyte composition of AGs. However, deterministic post-dispersal factors, such as the surrounding environmental conditions and plant succession, may also influence epiphyte composition. Here we ask whether epiphyte composition on a local scale is associated with dispersal constraints, local environmental conditions (light availability, number of branches and nest height) or AG successional stage. We sampled all epiphyte species in 18 AGs formed by Camponotus femoratus and Crematogaster levior in Central Amazon, Brazil. AGs were located within a range of 1 km and at a maximum of 20 m from the edges of a dirt road within a primary forest. Epiphytic composition showed strong spatial structure, decreasing in similarity with increasing distance. Environmental conditions and AG successional stage were not related to AG floristic composition, suggesting a key role of stochastic processes related to seed dispersal. A combination of seed abundance and attractiveness in neighbouring AGs seems to drive the higher similarity in epiphyte composition among closer AGs.",

The probability of interacting with more aggressive ant species was not influenced by the number of meristems with active extrafloral nectaries or by arthropod biomass.

    "abstract": "This study examines the dispersal system of Guapira opposita in a tropical sandy rainforest in southeast Brazil. Guapira trees produce small fruits with a high protein content (28.4%) and low lipid content (0.3%), and the plant is primarily dispersed by birds. Mature fruits of G. opposita can fall spontaneously with the pulp intact, or be dropped by birds with bits of pulp attached. In either case, ground-dwelling ants rapidly remove the fruits to their nest (93% after 12 h). The ponerine ants Odontomachus chelifer and Pachycondyla striata are the main seed vectors among the ants, and together account for 56% (20 of 36) of the ant-fruit interactions recorded on the forest floor. Individual workers of O. chelifer and P. striata transport single fruits to their nests. Bits of pulp are fed to larvae and worker nestmates, and intact seeds are discarded outside the nest. Germination success in Guapira is higher for cleaned seeds (pulp removed) than for seeds coated by pulp. Guapira seedlings and juveniles are more frequent close to Odontomachus nests than at sites without such nests. Soil samples from Odontomachus nests had greater penetrability, and higher concentrations of P, K, and Ca than random soil samples. Field experiments suggest that the association between G. opposita seedlings and O. chelifer nests can potentially render the plant some protection against herbivores. Results indicate that fruit displacement by ponerine ants play an important role in the biology of G. opposita seeds and seedlings in the sandy forest, and illustrate the complex nature of the dispersal ecology of tropical tree species.",

    "abstract": "The four species of the central African genus Barteria show variation in habitat and in degree of association with ants. Whereas B. solida, restricted to submontane forests, attracts opportunistic ants to extrafloral nectar, the three other species, found in lowland rainforests (B. fistulosa, B. dewevrei) and in littoral scrub (B. nigritana), possess stem domatia of varying shapes and degrees of specialisation, hosting either non-specific arboreal ants (B. nigritana, some B. dewevrei) or two large species of ants of the genus Tetraponera Smith, 1852 that are specific to some species of Barteria (B. fistulosa, some B. dewevrei). We aimed to investigate whether this variation represents an evolutionary trend toward increasing specialisation of mutualism or the reduction or loss of myrmecophytic traits. For this, we determined phylogenetic relationships within the genus using DNA sequences (primarily nuclear ITS) and microsatellite genotypes (11 loci) on a large sample of individuals, mostly from Cameroon and Gabon. The two types of markers support an initial dichotomy that groups B. dewevrei with B. nigritana and B. fistulosa with B. solida respectively. Within these pairs, species do not appear reciprocally monophyletic. At microsatellite loci, B. nigritana forms a clade embedded within B. dewevrei; and within both B. solida and B. fistulosa, geographical populations show levels of differentiation similar to that observed between populations of B. solida and B. fistulosa. Geographic distance alone does not account for genetic differentiation between species, which indicates reproductive isolation. Divergence in each of the two pairs implies evolutionary transitions in habitat and in myrmecophytism. Specialised mutualism with specific ant species of the genus Tetraponera has been lost in species found in more marginal habitats.",

In return, the plants can obtain extra nutrients, but this depends on intimate contact between the branching adventitious roots growing within inhabited pitchers and the organic debris brought in by the ants.  D. major pitchers were sampled in 2 very different habitats in Thailand: coastal heathland in the South, & the canopy of a 30 m-high Dipterocarpus alatus in the NE.  We recognized only one species of Philidris in these 2 locations.  Up to a few hundreds of workers & much brood were found in each pitcher.  Several dealate queens were all mated & egg-laying.  Workers are polymorphic in size & morphometric analysis showed that large individuals have disproportionally big heads.  Philidris th01 divided each pitcher into compartments by building walls around the roots; this increases surface area for their brood, but this selfish behavior also matches the epiphyte's trophic interests.  The entrances of adjacent pitchers were often enclosed by soil runways, connecting separate pitchers into one extensive nest.  This external accumulation of substrate may also benefit the epiphyte.  Philidris th01 occurs in different habitats throughout Thailand, including disturbed vegetation.  Some nests were found away from D. major, indicating that this ant-plant mutualism is not obligate.]",

Using an experimental approach within the semiarid intertropical region of Tehuacan-Cuicatl\u00b7n, Mexico, we manipulated the availability of food sources by constantly offering artificial nectaries on the shrub Prosopis laevigata (Fabaceae).  Over 2 time periods (day & night), we tested how the presence of a high-quality food source affected ant aggressiveness to herbivores.  We offered dummy caterpillars & counted the number of marks left by enemy attacks.  Overall the attack rate was extremely high: 84.25% of the dummy caterpillars were injured.  Ants were responsible for 86.22% of the marks left by enemies, & their aggression increased during the day, especially towards caterpillars in trees with high-quality food sources.  During the night, ants probably rely mostly on their antennae to detect potential herbivores; therefore, their ability to detect dummy caterpillars was greater during the day.

    "abstract": "*[Crotalaria pallida is a plant highly attended by ants because of its extrafloral nectaries, sugar-producing glands with no pollination relationship, located on the base of each flower or pod.  Superficially, it may seem that the consequences of the plant relationship with its herbivores are necessarily opposed to the consequences to the herbivore.  On the other hand, a cautious observation reveals that some mechanisms; that produce negative effects on the herbivore not automatically lead to a benefit for the plant.  Therefore, this work aim to evaluate the magnitude of the costs & benefits of ant attendance to the extrafloral nectaries of C. pallida on the protection against phytophagous insects, by estimating its fitness in the presence & absence of ants, as well as using field observations of the interactions of these plants with wasps.  The rates of biomass gain & herbivory, likewise the flower, pod & seed production, & also seed weight didn't differ significantly between ant-attended & non ant-attended C. pallida plants.  As opposed to this, the pod attack was significantly lower in C. pallida plants not attended by ants, & the survival of these plants was higher, in comparison to the ant-attended plants.  A field experiment indicated that larvae predation don't seem to be influenced by the presence of wasps, but only by ant attendance.  On the other hand, during field observations all the wasps visiting C. pallida pods were affected by ant attendance, & some of them reduced its visitation time while others left the pod after meeting an ant.  The results we got with the experiments & field observations suggest that the ants don't affect C. pallida fitness, at least not under the conditions found in the area, where this work took place.]",

The aim of this work was to determine whether patch size and edge effect affect the composition and frequency of ants that visit the EFNs of Croton lachnostachyus, and how these changes may alter the reproductive success of plants in a fragmented landscape of the Chaco forest, Argentina. Data were analyzed considering patch size and edge effects - as indicators of fragmentation - on ant assemblages visiting plants and on plant reproductive success through a field experiment. Ant species composition differed between the edge and interior of fragments, but not among fragments of different sizes. Dolichoderinae species and some bigger ants as Camponotus mus (Formicinae) were more abundant at the edges, whereas Myrmicinae ants dominated the interior of fragments. Foliar damage was higher in plants located at interior than at edges of fragments. The ant-exclusion experiment showed that seed mass, germinability, and foliar damage did not differ between control and ant-excluded plants. In contrast, fruit (year 2011) and seed production (years 2010 and 2011) was higher in control plants. We highlight the importance of studying ant-plant interactions combining different attributes of biodiversity (composition, structure, and function) to better understand ecological processes in fragmented landscapes.          *[A total of 21 species were found visiting extrafloral nectaries of C. lachnostachyus, representing 9 genera, in 4 subfamilies]",

    "abstract": "1. Deceptive species are a characteristic trait of insect-plant mutualisms. Deception of pollinators is essential for reproduction in diverse plant species; however, mimicry in seed dispersal is almost unknown. Myrmecochory, the dispersal of diaspores by ants, is a mutualism in which the elaiosome, a lipid-rich seed appendage, works as an ant reward. This coevolved interaction may be exploited by cheating, non-rewarding diaspores that mimic elaiosomes.   2. Our study assesses the impact of the morphology and fatty acid composition of diaspores on ant dispersal in rewarding and cheating myrmecochores and non-myrmecochorous species. Four elaiosome types (defined by Sernander 1906) were included in our research: the 'Viola odorata type', with a clearly defined elaiosome, the similar but diplochorous 'Euphorbia type' with an additional ballistic dispersal of diaspores, and the 'Puschkinia' and 'Hepatica' types, which we classify as 'cheaters' as they mimic ant rewards by chemical cues.   3. We tested the influence of morphology, chemical composition of diaspores and presence of rewards on removal rates of diaspores, dummies impregnated with seed extracts and pure fatty acids and scent-standardized diaspores in a population of Formica polyctena ants with 10 European spring ephemerals, mostly Ranunculaceae. The main free fatty acids of diaspores were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis.   4. Removal rates of diaspores and dummies treated with seed extracts were significantly influenced by their fatty acid composition. Discriminant function analysis confirmed oleic acid as the main trigger substance eliciting seed-removal behavior by ants in most species. Oleic acid content and removal rates differed among elaiosome types and were highest in rewarding myrmecochores, lower in cheaters and smallest in non-myrmecochorous seeds. Removal rates of scent-standardized diaspores did not differ among mutualists and cheaters suggesting a selective pressure for morphological adaptation and were lowest in non-myrmecochorous species, thus corroborating an influence of diaspore morphology on ant-removal patterns.  5. For the first time, we demonstrate chemical mimicry in myrmecochory as a means of seed dispersal. Evolutionary stability of the ant-seed mutualism is maintained by the ability of ants to discriminate between certain types of rewards and to respond with differential diaspore distribution rates.",

    "abstract": "Some species of cynipid wasp engage in mutualisms with ants by producing nectar\u0010secreting galls, providing carbohydrates, and receiving protection from parasitoids. The galls are functionally similar to extrafloral nectaries, plant structures well known for their role in ant-plant mutualisms. Though not well known, nectar\u0010secreting galls may have important ecological and evolutionary implications for arthropods, plants, and the evolution of ant\u0010mutualisms. Here, I review the known ecology of nectar\u0010secreting galls and speculate on their wider ecological significance based on past research and similar ecological systems. I then develop a conceptual framework for considering the possible historical role of nectar\u0010secreting galls in the evolution of ant\u0010mutualisms. I review current knowledge on the origin of ant\u0010mutualisms and develop a hypothesis for the role of nectar\u0010secreting galls using examples of similar, contemporary species interactions. Finally, I lay out some of the future directions for research into nectar\u0010secreting galls and their species interactions, including important questions that remain to be addressed. Future studies of the diversity and ecology of nectar\u0010secreting galls are necessary to determine the extent to which they may be involved in ecological functioning and the evolution of ant\u0010mutualisms, and it is hoped that this review will contribute to motivating and developing future research.",

Obligate myrmecophiles that do not attract ants through stridulatory or chemical signaling are limited to habitats, where ants are reliably present for other reasons, either among ant-attended hemipterans, on ant-plants, or around ant nests.  Particularly in the tropics, obligate ant associates that passively coexist with ants are more diverse than previously recognized, including, for example, hundreds of African species in the lycaenid subfamily Poritiinae.  Mutualists & parasites of ants have been reported in 11 families: Tineidae, Tortricidae, Cyclotornidae, Coleophoridae, Crambidae, Erebidae, Notodontidae, Hesperiidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae, and Riodinidae.  Altogether, myrmecophily has originated at least 30 times in Lepidoptera, & many groups may remain undiscovered.  The butterfly families Lycaenidae & Riodinidae contain the vast majority of ant-associated species: larvae of at least 3841 (71%) of the ~5390 described Lycaenidae & 308 (20%) of the ~1562 described Riodinidae are known or inferred to be ant-associated,.  Both families possess specialized, convergently developed exocrine glands & stridulatory devices to communicate with ants.  Many caterpillar-ant relationships previously characterized as mutualisms may actually be parasitic, as caterpillars can manipulate ants & ultimately exert a fitness cost.  In the family Lycaenidae, highly specialized & obligate ant associations are found largely in the Old World tropics, Australia, & Southern Africa, where the stoichiometry of soil micronutrients, particularly sodium and phosphorus, climate, host plants, & geography may all selectively shape caterpillar-ant associations.]",

Our analysis has taken the perspective of the butterfly.  Since larval survival is correlated with the level of ant attendance, any perturbation that subsequently alters the level of attendance provides us with a powerful bioassay.   The social behavior of the larvae & the pupae also appears to affect levels of ant attendance in complex ways.  Variation in the host plant quality & attendant ant colonies may affect the butterfly's overall distribution & clumping patterns, since females are more likely to lay eggs on high quality host plants that also contain ants.  However, even when a larva hatches  out upon a particular host plant. its propensity to aggregate with conspecifics can affect its numbers of attendant ants.  Joining or not joining a group is an additional fine-tuning mechanism by which a larva can adjust the level of ant  attendance.]",

Twenty-seven study trees possessed basal fire scars, and 26 fell toward the scarred side. Nine Basidiomycetes, including Fomes annosus, Poria albipellucida, Poria incrassata, and Armillaria mellea, were associated with decayed wood. Carpenter ants were found in or adjacent to the failure zone of nearly half of the study trees. Physical disturbances (e.g., roads, trails, streams) were associated with 22 tree failures, but their role in initiating requires further investigating.

    "abstract": "Plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) serve diverse ecological functions by providing nectar to a broad spectrum of arthropods (e.g., ants, parasitoids). This study examined the extent to which plant architecture of American elderberry (Sambucus canadensis L.; Sambucus nigra ssp. canadensis [L.] Bolli), resulting from two pruning methods that produced herbaceous (base-pruning) and woody (high-pruning) stems, and elderberry genotype (nine genotypes were evaluated) influenced ant attendance and arthropod abundance and diversity on elderberry EFNs. Results showed that the proportion of elderberry plants that produced EFNs was significantly greater for the base-pruning compared to the high-pruning method. The positive relationship found between the number of EFN-bearing plants that secreted nectar and ant attendance on EFNs was greater for the base-pruned plants compared to high-pruned plants. Plant genotype also significantly influenced the outcome. When base-pruned, the proportion of plants attended by ants was greatest for the genotypes Ocoee and Marge. The proportion of plants visited by other arthropods (e.g., parasitoids and predators) was greatest for the genotypes Ocoee, Bob Gordon, and Wyldewood. Overall, our findings indicate that the combination of plant genotype selection and selective pruning can modulate insect\u0013plant interactions including mutualistic ant\u0013elderberry associations and visitations by an array of arthropods.           *[NOTE: This identification needs to be confirmed.

Being ubiquitous and abundant, ant communities can affect the availability of resources to both primary and secondary consumers. As nitrogen is a limiting nutrient for plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems, deposition of ant manure may augment the host plants' acquisition of nitrogen. In this study, we quantified the manure deposited by colonies of the Asian weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina. We developed a method to estimate the amount of manure deposited in host trees (Mangifera indica) based on the trail activity of O. smaragdina. The rate of manure deposition was on average 62.3 kg dw ha-1 y-1, of which 0.2 kg ha-1 y-1 was deposited as urea-N, a nutrient that may be absorbed directly through the leaves, and 1.9 kg ha-1 y-1 was deposited as total nitrogen. Furthermore, ants given access to sucrose solution increased their rate of manure deposition significantly, suggesting that nectaries and/or trophobionts may play a major role in the production of ant manure. This study reveals that O. smaragdina can supply a significant amount of nitrogen to their host plants. In light of their remarkable abundance, the manure deposition by ants may have a hitherto unappreciated impact on the allocation of nutrients within their ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient supplies to plants from ants are well known from specialised myrmecophytic symbioses and from plants growing in soil close to ant nests. However, above\u0010ground nutrient pathways may play a largely unrecognised role also in less specialised ant-plant interactions - - the numerous facultative relationships, where ants forage on plants. In a laboratory experiment, weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) were confined to the canopies of coffee (Coffea arabica) seedlings, excluding any ant\u0010to\u0010plant transfer of nutrients via the soil strata. When ants were fed 15N\u0010labelled glycine and subsequently deposited faecal droplets on the seedlings, coffee leaves showed increased levels of 15N and total nitrogen compared to control plants without ants. This was evident for both exposed leaves and leaves covered in plastic bags (i.e. not directly exposed to ants). Thus, nitrogen from ant excretions was absorbed through the coffee leaves, and subsequently, translocated within the plants and possibly leading to the observed higher shoot/root (wet weight) ratios observed on ant\u0010plants compared to controls. Synthesis. These results reveal an undescribed foliar uptake of ant\u0010provided nutrients. If this is a general mechanism, a vast amount of ant-plant interactions involves fertilisation. Foliar fertilisation by ants may be an important steady benefit to plants, which has driven the evolution of ant-plant mutualisms in parallel with the well\u0010recognised but probably more fluctuating benefit from herbivore protection. Given the world\u0010wide abundance of plant canopies foraged by ants, this nutrient pathway may be of high ecological significance.",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant interactions have mainly been considered as a protection mutualism where ants increase plant performance through protection from herbivory. However, host plants may also benefit from nutrients deposited by ants. Nitrogen limits the plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems and the nutrient exchange between ants and plants may be an important mechanism operating in ant-plant interactions. In this study, we quantified the exchange of macronutrients (carbon and nitrogen) between ants and plants, using the Asian weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina as a model species in a mango agroecosystem. A method was developed with which the amount of nitrogen retrieved to their host trees could be predicted by the trail density of O. smaragdina. Ant nutrient consumption was calculated based on data on O. smaragdina abundance and per capita consumption rates obtained in laboratory colonies. On a yearly basis, the influx of nitrogen to the host tree, originating from captured prey, averaged 14.4 (range 8.0-46.4) kg N ha-1 y-1. The loss of carbon from the host tree due to ant consumption of exudates from nectaries and tended homopterans averaged 278.1 (range 149.3-939.9) kg C ha-1 y-1. O. smaragdina may provide their host plant with a significant source of nitrogen albeit a substantial amount of carbon is consumed from the host plant. This study reveals that the flow of nutrients between ants and plants may play a critical and underestimated role in ant-plant mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Protective ant-plant mutualisms - - where plants provide food or shelter to ants and ants protect the plants from herbivores - - are a common feature in many ecological communities, but few studies have examined the effect of disturbance on these interactions. Disturbance may affect the relationship between plants and their associated ant mutualists by increasing the plants' susceptibility to herbivores, changing the amount of reward provided for the ants, and altering the abundance of ants and other predators. Pruning was used to simulate the damage to buttonwood mangrove (Conocarpus erectus) caused by hurricanes. Pruned plants grew faster than unpruned plants, produced lower levels of physical anti-herbivore defenses (trichomes, toughness), and higher levels of chemical defenses (tannins) and extrafloral nectaries. Thus, simulated hurricane damage increased plant growth and the amount of reward provided to ant mutualists, but did not have consistent effects on other anti-herbivore defenses. Both herbivores and ants increased in abundance on pruned plants, indicating that the effects of simulated hurricane damage on plant traits were propagated to higher trophic levels. Ant-exclusion led to higher leaf damage on both pruned and upruned plants. The effect of ant-exclusion did not differ between pruned and unpruned plants, despite the fact that pruned plants had higher ant and herbivore densities, produced more extrafloral nectaries, and had fewer physical defenses. Another common predator, clubionid spiders, increased in abundance on pruned plants from which ants had been excluded. I suggest that compensatory predation by these spiders diminished the effect of ant-exclusion on pruned plants.",

'Silver' C. erectus plants have a dense layer of leaf hairs, or trichomes, while 'green' plants have very few trichomes. Ants are attracted to extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) produced on the foliage of both high- and low-trichome morphs. 2.High-trichome plants produced fewer and smaller EFNs. Conocarpus erectus plants with fewer and smaller EFNs produced less nectar and attracted fewer ants. 3.Ant exclusion increased herbivory and decreased growth in low-trichome plants, but had no detectable effect on herbivory and growth in high-trichome plants. 4.Synthesis. This study demonstrates that intraspecific variation in a direct anti-herbivore defence influences the magnitude of the beneficial effect of ants on plants. Individuals with low trichome densities benefitted from ant mutualists while individuals with high trichome densities did not. This likely creates stronger selection for the maintenance of EFN production in low-trichome plants, a conclusion supported by the fact that low-trichome plants produced more and larger EFNs than high-trichome plants, and suggests that the two morphs are on divergent evolutionary trajectories with regard to anti-herbivore defence.          *[The most common ant visitors are Camponotus tortuganus Emery, 1895; Brachymyrmex obscurior Forel, 1893; Crematogaster lucayana Wheeler, 1905; Crematogaster steinheili Forel, 1881; Dorymyrmex pyramicus Roger, 1863; Pseudomyrmex pallidus Smith 1855; & a Paratrechina sp.

In a Caribbean island system, a major manifestation of environmental change is seaweed deposition, which has been linked to eutrophication, overfishing, and hurricanes. Here, we show in a whole-island field experiment that without seaweed two predators- -lizards and ants- -had a substantially greater-than-additive effect on herbivory. When seaweed was added to mimic deposition by hurricanes, no interactive predator effect occurred. Thus environmental change can substantially restructure food-web interactions, complicating efforts to predict anthropogenic changes in ecosystem processes.  \u00a9AAAS.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between species are evolutionary malleable and may suffer changes in small timescales. Environmental disturbances, such as fire, can deeply affect species interactions, but how they influence the outcome of a mutualistic interaction has yet to be studied. In order to test the hypothesis that an environmental disturbance, in this case fire, may produce differences in the outcome of the association of ants with the extrafloral-nectaries-bearing plant Qualea multiflora Mart. (Myrtales: Vochysiaceae), a previous study was replicated, but this time after fire incidence, at the same study site and with the same plant species. Eight ant species visited Q. multiflora, and the most abundant genera were Crematogaster, Cephalotes, and Camponotus. Herbivores were found in branches with and without ants with no statistical difference, but foliar herbivory was always higher in branchs where ants were absent. Leaves were infested by fungi, and fungi spots were higher in branches where ants were present. Compared to the previous study, it was clearly observed that ant benefits to Q. multiflora varied over time. The most common ant species still protected leaves against chewing herbivores, but a new kind of leaf damage appeared, namely fungi spots. Data also support that ants may be acting as vectors of fungi spores on plants, as ant visited branches had higher fungus incidence than non-visited branches. Fire is a major source of disturbance in tropical savannas, and we suggest that it can cause strong variation in the outcomes of interactions between ants and plants with extrafloral nectaries in the Brazilian tropical savanna.",

    "abstract": "*[This study, conducted from April 1995 to June 1997, investigates the interaction between ants & non-myrmecochorous diaspores in a lowland Atlantic rain forest (Parque Estadual Intervales) in southeast Brazil.  Chapter 1 reports a survey of the ant-nonmyrmecochorous diaspore interactions carried out during 2 years along a 5-km transect sampled monthly.  A total of 886 interactions involving 37 ant species & 56 different diaspores were recorded.  No seasonal pattern of diaspore use by ants became clear.  The monthly number of interactions was not significantly correlated either with rainfall or mean temperature.  The number of ant species recorded in the interactions, however, was associated with these climatic parameters.  Any seasonal pattern of diaspore use by the ant community may have been masked by the year-round use of diaspores by the 2 most common litter-foraging ant species (one Pheidole & one Solenopsis) at the study site, & by the massive & episodic fruiting of some plant species whose diaspores are especially attractive to ants.  In Chapter 2, 6-nonmyrmecochorous plant species (Virola oleifera, Eugenia stictosepala, Cabralea canjerana, Citharexylum myrianthum. Alchornea glandulosa, & Hyeronima alchorneoides) whose diaspores differ in size & lipid content were selected to investigate how these features affect the outcome of ant-diaspore interactions.  Ants were in general rapid at discovering & cleaning the diaspores (ie., removal of pulp or aril).  Recruitment rate & ant attendance were higher for lipid-rich diaspores than for lipid-poor ones.  Removal rate & displacement distance were higher for small diaspores.  The large ponerine ant Pachycondyla striata, one of the most frequent attendants to lipid-rich arillate diaspores, transported the latter into their nests & discarded cleaned intact seeds on refuse piles outside the nest.  Gennination tests with cleaned & uncleaned diaspores revealed that the removal of pulp or aril may increase germination success in Virola oleifera, Cabralea canjerana, Citharexylum myrianthum, & Alchornea glandulosa.  Gas chromatography analyses revealed a close similarity in the fatty acid composition of the arils of the lipid-rich diaspores & the elaiosome of a typical myrmecochorous seed (=Ricinus communis), corroborating the suggestion that some arils & elaiosomes are chemically similar structures.  In Chapter 3, the removal of three seed species (Philodendron corcovadensis & P. apendiculatum Araceae, & Aechmea sp. - Bromeliaceae) from the feces of Capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) by ants in the understory & in 5 treefall gaps was investigated.  I asked if seed removal varied among seed species, between understory & gaps, & also among gaps differing in size and age.  Seventeen ant species, in 4 subfamilies & 9 genera, were recorded on the feces, 8 of which were observed removing seeds.  On average, 68% of the seeds were removed from the feces portions containing 15 seeds each after 24 h.  For both the understory vs. gap & the among-gap comparisons, seed species significantly affected the proportion of seeds removed, while deposition site had no effect.  These results can be interpreted as a consequence of the equalizing effect that 3 myrmicine ants (Pheidole spp.) had upon seed removal.  These species were responsible for the bulk of ant-seed interactions observed (77% in the both understory & gaps sites) & figure among the most abundant litter-foraging ants in the understory & gaps.   In conclusion, interactions between ants & fallen nonmyrmecochorous diaspores is common, especially in lowland rainforests where the abundance of ants is coupled with the year-round availability of fleshy diaspores.   The size & the lipid-content of the diaspores are major determinants of the outcome of such interactions.]",

The ants treat the arillate seeds in three different ways: (1) the large ponerine ants Pachycondyla striata and Odontomachus chelifer individually remove the seeds to their nests, (2) many species (Pheidole spp.) recruit workers to remove the aril on the spot, or (3) Solenopsis spp. recruit nestmates and cover the seeds with soil before removing the aril on the spot. The ants remove the aril exceptionally rapidly, and removal greatly facilitates seed germination. Seed predation by insects below fruiting trees is severe, and field experiments using vertebrate exclosures showed that rodents also prey heavily upon seeds found near parent trees. Ponerine ants actively remove seeds from this predation-prone zone. By removing bird-manipulated and naturally fallen seeds, ants can play a key role in the fate of medium-sized seeds like those of C. canjerana.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are among the main drivers of biodiversity losses, which can be caused by alterations in habitat structure. Animal-plant mutualistic interactions created in recipient communities may enhance alien species invasiveness. In this study, we investigate the relationships between the Japanese raisin tree (Hovenia dulcis) and ground\u0010foraging ant communities in the Atlantic Rainforest. Seven paired sites (n = 14) of invaded and uninvaded forests (control) were chosen. We sampled ant communities with pitfall traps in those sites during 2018 wintertime, before (June) and after H. dulcis infructescences fall on the forest floor (July). In June, leaf\u0010litter mass of invaded sites was higher, but ant diversity and composition were not affected. In July, leaf\u0010litter mass reduced, and infructescence offer triggered a higher ant diversity and distinct ant species composition in invaded sites. We additionally performed an experiment to understand the potential use of H. dulcis diaspores by ant species. We recorded 19 species exploiting H. dulcis diaspores, of which 18 consumed the fleshy peduncle in situ, and two removed diaspores for distances >1 cm. Our study indicates the invasion did not negatively affect ant communities by altering the leaf\u0010litter layer. On the contrary, ant communities benefited from the high\u0010resource availability during exposure to cold stress. Ant-H. dulcis diaspore interactions could further contribute to seed germination and propagule establishment, potentially enhancing H. dulcis invasiveness.

Given escalating climate extremes, understanding the effects of these phenomena on ecological relationships is crucial for biodiversity conservation. To understand how fire and frost affect interactions and influence biological communities in the Cerrado, our study aimed to comprehend the effects of these two disturbances on extrafloral nectar (EFN)-bearing plants (Ouratea spectabilis, Ochnaceae) and their interactions. Our main hypothesis was that plants affected by fire would grow again more quickly than those affected only by frost due to the better adaptation of Cerrado flora to fire. The results showed that fire accelerated the regrowth of O. spectabilis. Regrowth in plants with EFNs attracted ants that proved to be efficient in removing herbivores, significantly reducing foliar herbivory rates in this species, when compared to the species without EFNs, or when ant access was prevented through experimental manipulation. Post-disturbance ant and herbivore populations were low, with frost leading to greater reductions. Ant richness and diversity are higher where frost precedes fire, suggesting that fire restores Cerrado ecological interactions better than frost, with less impact on plants, ants, and herbivores.",

Ants increased plant flowering success by decreasing the densities of herbivores, and the effects of ants on folivores were positively related to the density of aphids. Unexpectedly, N fertilization produced no changes in plant N concentrations. Plants grown in higher N grew and flowered more, but aphid honeydew chemistry stayed the same, and neither the density of aphids nor the rate of ant attraction per aphid changed with N addition. The positive effects of ants and N addition on plant fitness were thus independent of one another. We conclude that N was the plant's limiting nutrient and propose that addition of the limiting nutrient is unlikely to alter the strength of mutualistic trophic cascades.",

In symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms, plants provide nesting space and food for ants, and ants defend plants against herbivores. The benefit to the plant of sustaining the growth of symbiotic ant colonies depends on whether defense by the growing ant colony outpaces the plant's growth in defendable area and associated herbivore pressure. These relationships were investigated in the symbiotic mutualism between Cordia alliodora trees and Azteca pittieri ants in a Mexican tropical dry forest. As ant colonies grew, worker production remained constant relative to ant-colony size. As trees grew, leaf production increased relative to tree size. Moreover, larger trees hosted lower densities of ants, suggesting that ant-colony growth did not keep pace with tree growth. On leaves with ants experimentally excluded, herbivory per unit leaf area increased exponentially with tree size, indicating that larger trees experienced higher herbivore pressure per leaf area than smaller trees. Even with ant defense, herbivory increased with tree size. Therefore, although larger trees had larger ant colonies, ant density was lower in larger trees, and the ant colonies did not provide sufficient defense to compensate for the higher herbivore pressure in larger trees. These results suggest that in this system the tree can decrease herbivory by promoting ant-colony growth, i.e., sustaining space and food investment in ants, as long as the tree continues to grow.",

    "abstract": "The Neotropical myrmecophytic tree Cordia alliodora hosts symbiotic Azteca ants in most of its widespread range. The taxonomy of the genus Azteca is notoriously difficult, which has frequently obscured species identity in ecological studies. We used sequence data from one mitochondrial and four nuclear loci to infer phylogenetic relationships, patterns of geographic distribution, and timing of diversification for 182 colonies of five C. alliodora-dwelling Azteca species from Mexico to Colombia. All morphological species were recovered as monophyletic, but we identified at least five distinct genetic lineages within the most abundant and specialized species, Azteca pittieri. Mitochondrial and nuclear data were concordant at the species level, but not within species. Divergence time analyses estimated that C. alliodora-dwelling Azteca shared a common ancestor approximately 10-22 million years ago, prior to the proposed arrival of the host tree in Middle America. Diversification in A. pittieri occurred in the Pleistocene and was not correlated with geographic distance, which suggests limited historical gene flow among geographically restricted populations. This contrasts with the previously reported lack of phylogeographic structure at this spatial scale in the host tree. Climatic niches, and particularly precipitation-related variables, did not overlap between the sites occupied by northern and southern lineages of A. pittieri. Together, these results suggest that restricted gene flow among ant populations may facilitate local adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. Differences in population structure between the ants and their host trees may profoundly affect the evolutionary dynamics of this widespread ant-plant mutualism.",

    "abstract": "1. Induced chemical responses to herbivory have been widely documented, however less attention has been given to the induced morphological defenses, particularly those that mediate protection mutualisms. One of the most widely studied mutualisms is the ant-plant protection mutualism, in which ants and other predatory arthropods defend plants against herbivores in exchange for food or housing. 2. Chemical and morphological traits that mediate this protection mutualism attract beneficial partners to plants. Thus induction of traits can lead to greater protection by mutualists when herbivores are present. In this study we examined whether extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are induced in response to simulated herbivory in Prunus avium. 3. In a greenhouse experiment, continuous damage to seedlings was simulated in two treatments intended to mimic different types of herbivores: (i) 50% of the area of each leaf was removed using a paper hole punch (e.g. insect herbivore simulation), and (ii) 50% of the area of each leaf was removed using scissors (e.g. browsing mammal simulation). Seedlings in the control group were not damaged. 4. Post-treatment, damaged plants produced significantly more EFNs per leaf on pre-existing leaves, as well as those that emerged following the onset of damage, than plants in the control group. Regardless of treatment, leaves emerging earlier supported fewer EFNs than leaves emerging later in the experiment. 5. Allocation to defense by seedlings, which have limited resources available, suggests the protection mutualism could be important to plant fitness in the field. Further study of patterns of EFN induction in P. avium seedlings is needed to better understand the significance of this induced response.",

In this scenario, we investigated the responses of ant assemblages and diaspore removal by ants to the transformations caused by mining and rehabilitation predicting that (a) the increase in plant density (a proxy for mining intensity) led to an increase in ant richness, percentage of diaspores removed, and changes in species composition that in turn are correlated with changes in environmental variables; (b) the increase in vegetation structure (a proxy for rehabilitation ages) led to an increase in ant richness, percentage of diaspores removed, and changes in species composition that in turn are correlated with changes in environmental variables. Additionally, we also verified which functional groups were primarily responsible for diaspore removal. We sampled arboreal and epigeic ants, diaspore removal by ants, and environmental variables. We found that ant richness and diaspore removal in mining intensity gradient are positively correlated to plant density. Although vegetation structure is positively correlated with ant richness, we found no changes in diaspore removal in rehabilitation gradient. Epigeic omnivore and epigeic generalist predator ants were the most responsible for diaspore removal. Then, we observed that mining decreases ant richness, altering ant assemblages and their functions, and rehabilitation with exotic plants is ineffective to promote the colonization by the main diaspore-removing ants.",

Applying this rate to a rate-smoothed Bayesian chronogram of the ants, the Decacrema from Macaranga are inferred to be at least 12 million years old, mid-Miocene.  However, using the extremes of rate variation in COI produces an age as recent as 6 million years.

The analyses revealed that each ant, plant or coccid operational (taxonomic) unit often associated with multiple operational (taxonomic) units of each of the other 2 guilds.  However, where testing was feasible, a 'preference' for one or sometimes 2 partner operational (taxonomic) units of each guild was often detected.  Mutual 'preferences' or 'avoidances' were relatively common among the symbionts, & no conflicts of interest were apparent.  The network of preferred partners among all 3 guilds showed compartmentalization structured by the presence/absence of plant epicuticular wax, suggesting that this feature plays a fundamental role in how the symbionts select partners that best serve their needs.

    "abstract": "Plants frequently attract natural enemies of their herbivores, resulting in a reduction in tissue damage and often in enhanced plant fitness. While such indirect defenses can dramatically change as plants develop, only recently have ecologists begun to explore such changes and evaluate their role in mediating plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions. Here we review the literature documenting ontogenetic patterns in plant rewards (i.e. extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), food bodies (FBs) and domatia) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and identify links between ontogenetic patterns in such traits and the attraction of natural enemies (ants). In the case of reward traits we concentrate in ant-plant studies, which are the most numerous. We report that all indirect defensive traits commonly vary with plant age but ontogenetic trajectories differ among them. Myrmecophytic species, which provide both food and shelter to their defenders, do not produce rewarding traits until a minimum size is reached. Then, a pronounced increase in the abundance of food rewards and domatia often occurs as plants develop, which explains the temporal succession or colony size increase of mutualistic ant species and, in some cases, leads to a reduction in herbivore damage and enhanced fitness as plants age. In contrast, ontogenetic patterns were less consistent in plant species that rely on VOC emissions to attract natural enemies or those that provide only food rewards (EFNs) but not nesting sites to their associated ants, showing an overall decline or lack of trend with plant development, respectively. Future research should focus on uncovering: (i) the costs and mechanisms underlying ontogenetic variation in indirect defenses, (ii) the relative importance of environmental and genetic components shaping these ontogenetic trajectories, and (iii) the consequences of these ontogenetic trajectories on plant fitness. Advances in this area will shed light on the context dependency of bottom-up and top-down controls of herbivore populations and on how natural selection actually shapes the ontogenetic trajectories of these traits.",

    "abstract": "Secondary seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) is an important process in semi\u0010arid environments where seeds are transported from the soil surface to an ant nest. Microsites from which ants often remove seeds are the small pits and depressions made by native and exotic animals that forage in the soil. Previous studies have demonstrated greater seed retention in the pits of native than exotic animals, but little is known about how biotic factors such as secondary seed dispersal by ants affect seed removal and therefore retention in these foraging pits. We used an experimental approach to examine how the morphology of burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur), greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis), short\u0010beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) foraging pits and ant body size influenced ant locomotion and seed removal from pits along an aridity gradient. Ants took 3.7\u0010times longer to emerge from echidna pits (19.6 s) and six\u0010times longer to emerge from bettong pits (30.5 s) than from rabbit pits (5.2 s), resulting in lower seed removal from bettong pits than other pit types. Fewer seeds were removed from pits when cages were used to exclude large body\u0010sized (>2 mm) ants. Few seeds were removed from the pits or surface up to aridity values of 0.5 (humid and dry sub\u0010humid), but removal increased rapidly in semi\u0010arid and arid zones. Our study demonstrates that mammal foraging pit morphology significantly affects ant locomotion, the ability of ants to retrieve seeds, and therefore the likelihood that seeds will be retained within foraging pits.          *[Fourteen ant species from 7 genera were recorded in the second study.  Ants located & removed some or all seeds from 94% of all pits.          We recorded a total of 52 ant species from 10 genera over the aridity gradient study.

A magic trait was assumed to simultaneously mediate mate choice, intraspecific competition, & mutualisms.  In scenarios of intimate, specialized mutualisms, individuals interact with one or few individual mutualistic partners, & diversification is constrained only if the mutualism is obligate.  In other scenarios, increasing numbers of different partners per individual limit diversification by generating stabilizing selection.  Stabilizing selection emerges from the greater likelihood of trait mismatches for rare, extreme phenotypes than for common intermediate phenotypes.  Constraints on diversification imposed by increased numbers of partners decrease if the trait matching degree has smaller positive effects on fitness.  When trait matching matters, mutualism-generated stabilizing selection would thus often constrain diversification in obligate mutualisms, such as ant-myrmecophyte associations, & in low-intimacy mutualisms, including plant-seed disperser systems.]",

    "abstract": "1. The simultaneous occupation of a rare understorey ant-acacia Acacia mayana by its guarding ant Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus, and an apparent opportunist parasite of the mutualism, the generalist ant Camponotus planatus is described. The two ant species occur together in 30.7% of the 26 mature A. mayana plants [23.5% of all trees (n = 34)] surveyed, but C. planatus is absent from saplings below 1 m in height (n = 8). 2.  While P. ferrugineus shows behavior compatible with effective host-tree defense, C. planatus does not attack phytophagous insects and appears ineffective as an ant-guard. Camponotus planatus does, however, occupy swollen thorns (pseudogalls) on the host tree, and harvests nectar from extrafloral leaf nectaries. It is proposed that C. planatus is a parasite of the Acacia-Pseudomyrmex mutualism. 3. Camponotus planatus does not harvest the second trophic reward produced by the tree for its Pseudomyrmex ant-guards, protein-rich food (Beltian) bodies. Camponotus planatus lack the specialized larval adaptations needed to use Beltian bodies as brood food, suggesting that this resource is potentially more resistant to exploitation by generalists than extrafloral nectar. 4. In competition for access to nectaries, C. planatus effectively displaced P. ferrugineus in 99.8% of encounters. These results suggest not only that C. planatus is a parasite of this mutualism, but also that it is able to effectively counteract the aggression shown to other insects by the resident ant-guards.",

    "abstract": "Ant\u0010acacias represent a classic insect\u0013plant mutualism: the ants defend the plant from attack by herbivores, and in return are provided with trophic rewards and living space within swollen thorns. A potential drawback of this and other ant\u0013plant mutualisms is that ant\u0010guards may drive away useful insects, particularly pollinators. We assess the potential for ant\u0013pollinator conflict in a Mexican ant\u0010acacia, Acacia hindsii. This Acacia is guarded by a highly aggressive ant (Pseudomyrmex veneficus), which resides entirely within the host plant canopy and is provided with extrafloral nectar and protein\u0010rich Beltian bodies. Acacia hindsii flowers released their pollen from 0700 to 0830 hours, and were visited by pollinators from 0730 to 1300 hours. Over the same time period ants maintained high activity levels at extrafloral nectaries on young leaves. Although daily activity of ants and pollinators overlapped substantially in time, it was largely separated in space: resources exploited by the ants are predominantly concentrated within new growth, while inflorescences are present only on shoots from the previous year. Ants nevertheless visit extrafloral nectaries on older leaves near inflorescences, and there is thus potential for ant\u0013pollinator conflict. Bioassays of ant behavior showed young A. hindsii inflorescences induce an avoidance response in its ant\u0010guards, which reinforces spatial segregation between ants and pollinators. This effect is absent from buds or postreproductive flowers. Young flowers of two non\u0010myrmecophilous Acacia species also induced significant (though less potent) repellent effects, suggesting a general role for ant\u0010repellents in Acacia, with selective enhancement in myrmecophilous species.",

We evaluate how Copaifera langsdorffii, a widespread tree species adapted to multiple ecosystems, responds to shifts in nutrient and water availability through experimental supplementation and how it affects its insect communities. We also evaluate how the presence of extrafloral nectaries (EFN) exudates modifies galling insect diversity and herbivory rates. Such experimental approach is scarce, as we simultaneously evaluate biotic and abiotic factors and cover the entire reproductive cycle of a species in natural environments, bringing important contributions to better understand how bottom-up factors drive species interactions and possibly community assembly. The experiment was set in an ironstone outcrop vegetation, where we deployed supplementation treatments in 80 plant individuals divided into the following field treatments: (T1/=/Fertilizer, T2/=/EFN simulation (Eppendorf tubes with a 20% sugar solution), T3/=/fertilizer/+/EFN simulation, T4/=/water spray, T5/=/EFN control (microtube with water), and T6/=/Control.. We observed lower sclerophylly and greater leaf area in plant individuals that were supplemented with nutrients and water. Herbivory rates were lower and ant abundance was higher in plants with artificial EFNs available. While we did not observe variations in richness and abundance of galling insects, the patterns of co-occurrence of galls varied with the availability of resources (nesting space) in the plant. This study illustrates how variations in nutrient availability to plants modify interactions with insect communities. Ant-plant interactions can have a negative impact on general herbivory rates, however ants seem to have a more harmonious relationship with the galling insects.          *[Camponotus rufipes is the only ant identified in paper.]",

    "abstract": "The ant-plant mutualism mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) is based on the provision of extrafloral nectar (a sugar-rich liquid) in exchange for ant defense against herbivores. The extrafloral nectar production can vary depending on the intensity or types of leaf damage caused by different mouthparts of insect herbivores (i.e., sucking or chewing insects). However, it is poorly known how the type of herbivore damage changes the outcomes of tri-trophic interactions. Here, we address how the damage inflicted by different herbivore groups affects extrafloral nectar production and ants\u0019 attendance and aggressiveness. Through an experimental field study, we tested whether the type of leaf damage, sucking or chewing, changes extrafloral nectar volume and sugar concentration, and subsequently ant composition and behavior. We evaluated the extrafloral nectar production and ant attendance and aggressiveness before and after simulated herbivory in Qualea parviflora (Vochysiaceae), a Brazilian savanna EFN-bearing plant. We found that only plants with sucking damage increased the sugar concentration of their extrafloral nectar, only plants with chewing damage increased ant abundance, and surrogate herbivore predation differed before and after simulated herbivory only for sucking damage. We provided the first evidence that the type of damage can influence ant aggressiveness via changes in extrafloral nectar production, translating to changes in the outcomes of this ant-plant mutualism. Ultimately, studies should consider the effects of herbivore damage type when studying insect-plant interactions.",

    "abstract": "Establishing a horizontally transmitted mutualism is a critical step for many organisms, particularly when an individual can engage with only one partner over its lifetime. Ant foundresses shed their wings before they start to lay eggs, which makes host choice particularly critical for plant\u0010ants that exclusively colonize myrmecophytes. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can indicate the identity and physiological condition of an individual and frequently serve as signals or cues that facilitate partner choice. Thus, we hypothesized that obligate plant\u0010ants use VOCs to determine the quality of potential host plants. Indeed, winged females of the plant\u0010ant, Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus, used plant odours to identify high\u0010quality acacia hosts among different species and among individuals of the same species. The VOC blend of a branch was related to reward production and, interestingly, the least attractive blend contained the highest number of compounds. Although only seven different VOCs could be detected in the blend of the high\u0010reward host species, the low\u0010reward host emitted 13 different compounds, among which (S)\u0010(\u0010)\u0010limonene and \u2264\u0010linalool were the dominant ones. Complementing the odour of the high\u0010reward host with (S)\u0010(\u0010)\u0010limonene, \u2264\u0010linalool or \u00b1\u0010terpinene reduced its attractiveness. Strikingly, these compounds inhibited bacterial pathogens of the host plant. Synthesis. Plant\u0010ants can use host plant odours that contain resistance\u0010related VOCs to judge on host quality, likely because of negative crosstalk between direct resistance to disease and investment in ant\u0010mediated defence. VOCs can serve as cues that provide reliable information for partner choice, particularly when their emission results from a physiological process that causally relates to the quality of an individual as a mutualist.",

The trees form a mutualism with one of 3 ant species, in order of most to least common at the study site: Pseudomyrmex spinicola, P. flavicornis, & Crematogaster brevispinosa.  I found that chemical compounds produced by Mozena sp. in both the metathoracic gland & the cuticle reduced the number of ant attacks & cuticular compounds appeared to be essential in escaping recognition on ant-occupied Vachellia spp. trees.  The compounds were effective on multiple colonies & for multiple ant species, thus they are not strictly host-specific or species-specific.  In addition, gas chromatography & mass spectrometry analyses of cuticular compounds revealed a close match between chemical profiles of Mozena sp. & Pseudomyrmex spinicola ants, suggesting chemical mimicry is the primary mechanism by which Mozena sp. exploits the ant-acacia mutualism.  To examine the prevalence of a cost of exploitation for plant partners in exploited mutualisms, I conducted a meta-analysis of studies from the published literature.  I found that exploitation has a weak, negative, but insignificant impact on the reproductive success of mutualistic plants.  Collectively, these analyses illuminated methods by which exploiters may succeed in infiltrating mutualisms & suggested that the relatively low costs of exploitation may account for the lack of destabilization & degradation by exploiters of some mutualistic interactions.]",

The present study explored this variation by focusing on correlations between morphophysiological characteristics of Cecropia pachystachya plants and the sizes of the populations of their breeding ant colonies (Azteca ovaticeps and A. alfari) in secondary forest and pasture habitats in the Atlantic Forest. We hypothesize that forest plants are (i) larger and (ii) harbor more populous colonies than pasture plants. More populous colonies have a greater number of workers to defend their host plant, so we hypothesize that aggressiveness depends on the (iii) ant species and habitat. In each habitat, we collected 60 plants hosting Azteca colonies (queen, worker, immature, and winged individuals). The heights and stem diameters of the plants were measured and the M\u00b8llerian bodies were counted. We counted the number of workers, immature individuals, and winged individuals as an indicator of the size of the Azteca populations. We conducted aggressive behavior tests among individuals from 35 different colonies. In general, plants and colonies were smaller in the pasture than in the forest. In both habitats, the populations of A. ovaticeps were larger than those of A. alfari, but they were not more aggressive. The habitat directly influenced the physical structures of the plants and those in turn influenced the size of the ant populations. The conversion of forests into simplified habitats such as pastures can lead to a drastic reduction or local extinction of certain ant populations and compromise Cecropia-Azteca mutualistic relations.",

    "abstract": "Placement of seeds in favourable microsites by inhumation in ant nests is considered a principal advantage of myrmecochory. However, nest chambers may be too deep to allow seedling emergence. In this case, successful germination requires secondary transport of seeds to shallower sites. Little is known about the architecture of nests of seed-dispersing ants and the locations within nests to which seeds are initially transported. These data are essential to assess the importance of secondary transport for germination success of seeds. We studied dispersal of Manihot esculenta subsp. flabellifolia seeds by Ectatomma brunneum ants in French Guianan savannas. We followed movements of seeds within nests by offering marked diaspores to foraging workers, observing transport into the nest, then excavating to determine locations of marked seeds. In 4 nests, chambers ranged from 2 to 40 cm deep. Because elaiosomes are fed to brood, Manihot diaspores were initially transported to deep chambers, where brood was concentrated. Recovered diaspores had been carried to chambers 14-40 cm deep, all deeper than the maximum burial depth for emergence (~ 13.8 cm) predicted from the mass (~ 0.13 g) of Manihot seeds. Nest architecture thus makes secondary vertical transport of seeds crucial for dispersal success of this species. Failure of secondary transport may be an underestimated mortality factor in myrmecochorous plants.",

This paper draws together geographical variation and various correlates of individual seed dispersal success to evaluate spatial variation in major determinants of seed removal rates of the myrmecochore Helleborus foetidus, whose ant assemblages and diaspores vary geographically. 2. We censused seed removal by ants directly from individual plants in 12 populations and four regions across the Iberian Peninsula, and measured the elaiosomed seed, plant fecundity, and the biotic and abiotic environment in the close vicinity of each plant.  The relative effect of these three groups of variables on seed removal was then modeled at each region using structural equation models and path analyses. 3. We found a pervasive effect of the close surroundings of each plant on dispersal. We also found a geographically variable influence of diaspore traits on dispersal. Such variable influence of the diaspore was closely related to the compositional and functional variation in ant guilds. 4. Synthesis: The appearance of an effect of diaspore and plant traits on dispersal depended on the surroundings of the plant, the identity of the ant visitors and ant abundance. This dependence itself might lead to different directions of selection among populations, a conclusion that has not emerged from seed offerings to ants, which is the usual protocol in myrmecochory research.",

Each Piper species has 3 unique amides, & in each experiment, larvae were fed diets containing different concentrations of single amides or combinations of the 3.  The amides from P. imperiale had negative synergistic effects on generalist survival & specialist pupal mass, but had no effect on specialist survival.  Piper cenocladum amides also acted synergistically to increase mortality caused by parasitoids, & the direct negative effects of mixtures on parasitoid resistance & pupal mass were stronger than indirect effects via changes in growth rate & approximate digestibility.  Our results are consistent with plant defense theory that predicts different effects of plant chemistry on generalist versus adapted specialist herbivores.

    "abstract": "Abstract (in part): This research quantified the number of ant-plant associations mediated by liquid/energy food sources and the intensity of their use by ants. Thirty ant species and 102 plant species were related in 312 associations. The Leguminosae (23 species) was the family of plants most visited by ants. Camponotus planatus was the ant using the most plant species (72) as food source. Ant-plant specificity was very low. Food resources most used by ants were nectar from reproductive structures, homopteran honeydew, floral nectar, and extrafloral nectar. (....) Introduction (in part): Plants must meet all of the dietary or other needs (e.g. nesting) of ants in order to obtain high levels of defense and specificity. As this is rare, most ant-plant associations are predicted to be relatively unspecialized and opportunistic. Discussion (in part): Given the low number of species-specific ant-plant associations found in this study (=e.g. Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus/Acacia cornigera it appears that ant-plant associations in the study area are largely fortuitous, diffuse, and facultative. Specialization between particular ant and plant species is rare, suggesting that only occasionally does selection favor obligate mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Despite recognition of key biotic processes in shaping the structure of biological communities, few empirical studies have explored the influences of abiotic factors on the structural properties of mutualistic networks. We tested whether temperature and precipitation contribute to temporal variation in the nestedness of mutualistic ant-plant networks. While maintaining their nested structure, nestedness increased with mean monthly precipitation and, particularly, with monthly temperature. Moreover, some species changed their role in network structure, shifting from peripheral to core species within the nested network. We could summarize that abiotic factors affect plant species in the vegetation (e.g., phenology), meaning presence/absence of food sources, consequently an increase/decrease of associations with ants, and finally, these variations to fluctuations in nestedness. While biotic factors are certainly important, greater attention needs to be given to abiotic factors as underlying determinants of the structures of ecological networks.          *[Crematogaster brevispinosa = C. rochai.]",

The effects of temperature & precipitation on the seasonal distribution of the number of ant-plant interactions differed among habitats.  The general linear models fitted to the ant-plant interaction curves explained 78.8% of the variation for La Mancha, 80.1% for Zapotitlan, 18% for San Benito, and 29.5% for Xalapa.  Even though rainfall is low in Zapotitlan and San Benito, minimum temperature was the most important factor accounting for the seasonal distribution & low number of interactions.  At La Mancha, with milder minimum temperatures & higher water availability, temperature alone did not account for the seasonal distribution & number of interactions, whereas the effect of the precipitation X temperature interaction was highly significant.  Xalapa exhibits the lowest temperatures & the highest precipitation, but the role of these factors was only marginal.  We suggest that the vegetation at Xalapa, a mixture of tropical and temperate floristic elements, constrains ant-plant interactions due to a limited presence of nectaries.  Also, ants are less abundant in cool and relatively aseasonal habitats.  The other habitats have tropical floristic elements that are abundant & frequently have nectar-producing structures.  We report considerable variation among habitats in the number & seasonal distribution of ant-plant interactions.

The study was done during September of 1999 at the Reserva Ecol\u00dbgica of IBGE (ca. 35 km S of Brasilia-DF, Brasil).  The results show that ants were attracted both to the experimental food source & to the membracids.  Moreover, the mean number of ants visiting the experimental nectary was significantly higher than those visiting the membracids.  However, the membracids were never left unattended, which suggests that ants, even though presented with an abundant & rich food source, do not abandon other sources.  The latter can be explained due to an increment in the honeydew production rate by the membracids, thus the attention levels of ants does not vary.  Another possibility is the fidelity of worker ants to a food source and its location.]",

The trees' ant fauna was dominated by ground-nesting species & ants were scarce in tree crowns, constituting only 2% of all arthropods collected by branch beating.  Leaf damage was principally caused by caterpillars (mainly the pyralid Eulepte gastralis) & by beetles (mainly the chrysomelid Walterianella inscripta).  Sugar baits at tree trunks revealed that rewarding food resources recruited high ant numbers to some tree individuals.  Activity of the dominant ant, Ectatomma ruidum, at baits was negatively related to leaf damage by E. gastralis, suggesting that trees might be better protected from this herbivore, when ant abundance is high.  Exclusion of ants resulted in increased beetle diversity.  The key herbivore W. inscripta was significantly more abundant on ant-exclusion branches at the beginning, but not towards the end of the rainy season, when beetle density increased.

    "abstract": "Invasive species can indirectly affect ecosystem processes via the disruption of mutualisms. The mutualism between the whistling thorn acacia (Acacia drepanolobium) and four species of symbiotic ants is an ecologically important one; ants strongly defend trees against elephants, which can otherwise have dramatic impacts on tree cover. In Laikipia, Kenya, the invasive big\u0010headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) has established itself at numerous locations within the last 10-15 years. In invaded areas on five properties, we found that three species of symbiotic Crematogaster ants were virtually extirpated, whereas Tetraponera penzigi co\u0010occurred with P. megacephala. T. penzigi appears to persist because of its nonaggressive behavior; in a whole\u0010tree translocation experiment, Crematogaster defended host trees against P. megacephala, but were extirpated from trees within hours. In contrast, T. penzigi retreated into domatia and withstood invading ants for >30 days. In the field, the loss of defensive Crematogaster ants in invaded areas led to a five\u0010 to sevenfold increase in the number of trees catastrophically damaged by elephants compared to un\u0010invaded areas. In savannas, tree cover drives many ecosystem processes and provides essential forage for many large mammal species; thus, the invasion of big\u0010headed ants may strongly alter the dynamics and diversity of East Africa's whistling thorn savannas by disrupting this system\u0019s keystone acacia-ant mutualism.",

    "abstract": "Plant-plant interactions can be a complex mixture of positive and negative interactions, with the net outcome depending on abiotic and community contexts. In savanna systems, the effects of large herbivores on tree-grass interactions have rarely been studied experimentally, though these herbivores are major players in these systems. In African savannas, trees often become more abundant under heavy cattle grazing but less abundant in wildlife preserves. Woody encroachment where cattle have replaced wild herbivores may be caused by a shift in the competitive balance between trees and grasses. Here we report the results of an experiment designed to quantify the positive, negative, and net effects of grasses, wild herbivores, and cattle on Acacia saplings in a Kenyan savanna. Acacia drepanolobium saplings under four long-term herbivore regimes (wild herbivores, cattle, cattle + wild herbivores, and no large herbivores) were cleared of surrounding grass or left with the surrounding grass intact. After two years, grass-removal saplings exhibited 86% more browse damage than control saplings, suggesting that grass benefited saplings by protecting them from herbivory. However, the negative effect of grass on saplings was far greater; grass-removal trees accrued more than twice the total stem length of control trees. Where wild herbivores were present, saplings were browsed more and produced more new stem growth. Thus, the net effect of wild herbivores was positive, possibly due to the indirect effects of lower competitor tree density in areas accessible to elephants. Additionally, colonization of saplings by symbiotic ants tracked growth patterns, and colonized saplings experienced lower rates of browse damage. These results suggest that savanna tree growth and woody encroachment cannot be predicted by grass cover or herbivore type alone. Rather, tree growth appears to depend on a variety of factors that may be acting together or antagonistically at different stages of the tree's life cycle.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of ant-plant-herbivore interactions for the plant depend on the abundance of ants and herbivores and the selective pressures these arthropods exert. In plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFN), different mean trait values may be selected for by different populations in response to local herbivore pressure, ultimately resulting in the evolution of differences in plant traits that attract ants as defensive agents against herbivory. To determine if variation in traits that mediate ant-plant interactions reflect herbivore selective pressures, we quantified intra- and inter-population variation in plant traits for eight populations of the EFN-bearing annual Chamaecrista fasciculata (Michx.) (Fabaceae). Censuses in rural and urban areas of Missouri and Illinois (USA) showed population differences in ant attendance and herbivore pressure. Seeds were collected from each population, and plants were grown in a common greenhouse environment to measure sugar production, nectar volume and composition, EFN size and time of emergence, leaf pubescence, and leaf quality throughout plant development. Populations varied mainly in terms of nectary size, sugar production, and nectar volume, but to a lesser degree in leaf pubescence. Populations of C. fasciculata within urban areas (low in insect abundance) had small nectaries and the lowest nectar production. There was a positive correlation across populations between herbivore density and leaf damage by those herbivores on the one hand and sugar production and nectar volume on the other. These results, in conjunction with lack of evidence for maternally based environmental effects, suggest that population differences in herbivore damage have promoted differential evolution of EFN-related traits among populations.",

Given the background of specialized pollination for the family and the genus, we explored the floral visitors of B. andrieuxii, describing the flower ecology of this saprophilous species. We found that flowers display thermogenesis, as their temperature was above the air temperature. Flowers produce nectar only at noon, in similar quantities and concentrations among both female and male inflorescences. Floral visitors belong to four functional groups: ants, carrion flies, flies, and butterflies. Their visitation peaks coincide with the moment of nectar secretion. Butterflies were the most common visitors, foraging male and female inflorescences, always touching sexual organs. We observed oviposition behavior and found eggs on floral tissues after butterfly visits. Lepidopteran larvae were found in all analyzed infructescences, feeding on floral and fruit tissues. Despite the larvae appearing to develop parallel to fruits and seeds, these insects did not affect the fruit or seed development. We conclude that B. andrieuxii have brood-site pollination by butterflies of genus Cissia in the studied population. The flowers display traits related to this pollination type: dark-colored flowers, a rotten-fruit smell, and thermogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Symbiosis between plants and ants include examples in which the plant provides shelter and/or food for ants that, in turn, act in the defense or in the dispersion of seeds from the host plant. Although traditionally referred as mutualistic, the results of these interactions may vary with the ecological context in which patterns are involved. A range of species have facultative association with Turnera subulata (Turneraceae). Here, using behavioral bioassays, we investigated the effects of the most frequent ant species associated with T. subulata (Brachymyrmex sp.1, Camponotus blandus (Smith), Dorymyrmex sp.1, Crematogaster obscurata Emery, and Solenopsis invicta Buren) in the dispersion of plant host seeds and in the number of seedlings around the associated ant nests. We also evaluated the effects of these ant species in the germination of T. subulata seeds, in the consumption of elaiosome, and in the attractiveness to elaiosome odor. Our results showed that the ant species associated with T. subulata presented variation in the attraction by the odor and in the rate of consumption of the elaiosomes. However, none of the ant species studied contributed significantly to the increase of seed germination and seedling growth. Our results suggest that the consumption of the elaiosome by ant species is not a determinant factor to the success of germination of T. subulata.

    "abstract": "Interactions among plants secreting extrafloral nectar (EFN) and arthropods, mainly ants, have traditionally been considered as a classic example of mutualism. However, the net balance of these interactions can be highly variable according to biotic and abiotic factors. In the present study, we investigated whether the production of EFN in the Neotropical shrub Turnera subulata (Turneraceae) is induced by ecological context (i.e. biotic and abiotic factors). For this, we tested the hypotheses that the production of EFN in T. subulata plants is increased according to the biotic (phonological stage, herbivore and its simulation, presence of associated ants) and abiotic factors (water stress) in order to protect the most valuable and vulnerable parts. Manipulative experiments were carried out under greenhouse conditions. First, the production of EFN was analyzed in plants of T. subulata in vegetative and reproductive stages with and without water stress. Then, EFN production in response to herbivory and presence of associated ants were tested in plants in the reproductive with and without water stress. EFN volume was estimated with microcapillaries tubes. In general, plants under water stress produced less EFN than plants without stress. The production of EFN was increased in the reproductive stage and under herbivory. Plants under herbivory and with water stress produced a higher amount of EFN only when experience damages caused by the specialist herbivore. On the other hand, plants did not respond to the removal of EFN by ants or manually. Our results demonstrate that T. subulata can modulate the production of EFN according to the ecological context. The plastic response in the production of EFN by T. subulata seems to minimize the costs in defense.",

Most studies to date, however, have focused on the impacts just two species (Linepithema humile and Solenopsis invicta). The impacts of many other invasive ant species on ecological processes in their introduced range are unknown. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the invasive ant Pachycondyla chinensis disrupts ant-seed dispersal mutualisms by displacing native ant species, especially the keystone mutualist Aphaenogaster rudis, while failing to disperse seeds itself. In a paired design we measured the impact of P. chinensis on the native ant-plant seed dispersal mutualism. The number of A. rudis workers was 96% lower in invaded than in intact plots, and the number of seeds removed was 70% lower in these plots. Finally, in invaded plots the abundance of Hexastylis arifolia, a locally abundant myrmecochorous plant, was 50% lower than in plots where P. chinensis was absent. A parsimonious interpretation of our results is that P. chinensis causes precipitous declines in the abundance of A. rudis within invaded communities, thereby disrupting the ant-plant seed dispersal mutualisms and reducing abundances of ant-dispersed plants. In sum, the magnitude of the effects of P. chinensis on seed dispersal is quantitatively similar to that documented for the intensively studied invasive Argentine ant. We suggest that more studies on the impacts of less-studied invasive ant species on seed dispersal mutualisms may increase our knowledge of the effects of these invaders on ecosystem function.",

However, mutualistic interactions are not well resolved because of a historical bias toward examining antagonistic interactions. Here we examine both antagonistic and facilitative interactions between tropical plants and arthropods by characterizing the biotic interactions between a common myrmecophytic shrub, Piper immutatum Trel. (Piperaceae), the ants hosted by this plant, Pheidole sp. (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), and their associated communities of herbivorous and predatory arthropods. To determine if ant mutualists affect the altitudinal distribution of Neotropical myrmecophytes, P. immutatum interactions with arthropods were quantified across a tropical elevational gradient. Piper immutatum was most abundant in lower montane forests (1000-1600 m asl) and disappeared above 1600 m asl, and colonies of Pheidole sp. inhabited 90 percent of the sampled plants. The myrmecophyte was then transplanted within and beyond its altitudinal range, excluding ants from half of the transplanted plants. Plant survival was affected primarily by elevation, with only 20 percent surviving above 1600 m asl. Ant exclusion did not significantly affect plant mortality. Nevertheless, ant colony size did affect both herbivory and nutrient availability for surviving P. immutatum, with nutrient availability having a stronger effect than antiherbivore defense on growth and biomass. This approach of studying the contributions of ant mutualisms across the myrmecophyte's habitat range yields an improved picture of the role of mutualistic interactions in determining community structure.",

    "abstract": "Individual species can have profound effects on ecological communities, but, in hyperdiverse systems, it can be challenging to determine the underlying ecological mechanisms. Simplifying species\u0019 responses by trophic level or functional group may be useful, but characterizing the trait structure of communities may be better related to niche processes. A largely overlooked trait in such community-level analyses is behaviour. In the Neotropics, epiphytic tank bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) harbour a distinct fauna of terrestrial invertebrates that is mainly composed of predators, such as ants and spiders. As these bromeliad-associated predators tend to forage on the bromeliads' support tree, they may influence the arboreal invertebrate fauna. We examined how, by increasing associated predator habitat, bromeliads may affect arboreal invertebrates. Specifically, we observed the trophic and functional group composition, and the behaviour and interspecific interactions of arboreal invertebrates in trees with and without bromeliads. Bromeliads modified the functional composition of arboreal invertebrates, but not the overall abundance of predators and herbivores. Bromeliads did not alter the overall behavioural profile of arboreal invertebrates, but did lead to more positive interactions in the day than at night, with a reverse pattern on trees without bromeliads. In particular, tending behaviours were influenced by bromeliad-associated predators. These results indicate that detailed examination of the functional affiliations and behaviour of organisms can reveal complex effects of habitat-forming species like bromeliads, even when total densities of trophic groups are insensitive.",

Based on previous knowledge regarding the existence of extended benefits for birds in the acacia-ant interaction, the role of the rufous-naped wren was analyzed within the ant-acacia system. Nest predation was assessed taking into account tree species with and without myrmecophytic interactions, tree cover and height, the presence and abundance of ants, predator type, and the distance between each nest and the closest myrmecophyte acacia. The probability of survivorship of artificial nests using a known fate analysis was calculated. The results showed non-significant differences in the probability of survivorship regardless of the presence and density of myrmecophyte acacias, tree cover and height, the presence and abundance of ants, or predator type. Interestingly, the highest degree of predation in the artificial nests was related to the rufous-naped wren.

Here, we provide a qualitative and quantitative field account on the natural history and ecology of these two ant species. The study was carried out in a cerrado reserve in south-eastern Brazil across a rainy/hot season (summer) and a dry/cold season (winter). The ants were found in two vegetation physiognomies: all nests of C. rufipes were located in the cerrado sensu stricto (scrub of shrubs and trees, 3-8 m tall), whereas C. renggeri occurred mostly in the cerrad\u201eo (forest with more or less merging canopy, 10-12 m tall). Both species nested in fallen or erect dead trunks, as well as underground. In addition, C. rufipes built nests using dead plant material arranged or not around shrub bases. Colonies of C. rufipes were generally more populous than those of C. renggeri, and both species had colonies with more than one dealated queen. Both species were active mainly at night and foraged for resources near their nests, mainly extrafloral nectar and hemipteran honeydew (aphids and mealybugs). The average size of the home ranges of C. renggeri in cerrado sensu stricto and cerrad\u201eo varied from H 2.8 to 4.0 m\u2264 and apparently were not affected by season. In C. rufipes, however, foraging grounds in cerrado sensu stricto showed a twofold increase from dry/cold (H 4.5 m\u2264) to rainy/hot season (H 9.8 m\u2264).

In open pollinated plants & when access was given exclusively to flying insects, fruit set was nearly 100%.  In plants visited by ants only, roughly one third of flowers set fruit, & almost none set fruit when all insects were excluded.  The germination rate of seeds from flowers pollinated by flying insects was 31 +-7% in contrast to 1 +- 1% resulting from ant pollination.

Effects reviewed were plant herbivory, herbivore abundance, hemipteran abundance, predator abundance, plant biomass and reproduction in studies where ants were experimentally removed (n = 273 independent comparisons). Ant removal exhibited strong effects on herbivory rates, as plants without ants suffered almost twice as much damage and exhibited 50% more herbivores than plants with ants. Ants also influenced several parameters of plant fitness, as plants without ants suffered a reduction in biomass (-23.7%), leaf production (-51.8%), and reproduction (-24.3%). Effects were much stronger in tropical regions compared to temperate ones. Tropical plants suffered almost threefold higher herbivore damage than plants from temperate regions and exhibited three times more herbivores. Ant removal in tropical plants resulted in a decrease in plant fitness of about 59%, whereas in temperate plants this reduction was not statistically significant. Ant removal effects were also more important in obligate ant-plants (=myrmecophytes) compared to plants exhibiting facultative relationships with Hemiptera or those plants with extrafloral nectaries and food bodies. When only tropical plants were considered and the strength of the association between ants and plants taken into account, plants with obligate association with ants exhibited almost four times higher herbivory compared to plants with facultative associations with ants, but similar reductions in plant reproduction. The removal of a single ant species increased plant herbivory by almost three times compared to the removal of several ant species. Altogether, these results suggest that ants do act as plant biotic defenses, but the effects of their presence are more pronounced in tropical systems, especially in myrmecophytic plants.",

The caterpillars shelter in the domatia & feed on food bodies whose production increases as a result.  They delay colonization by ants by weaving a silk shield above the youngest trichilium, where the food bodies are produced, blocking access to them.  This probable temporal priority effect also allows female moths to lay new eggs on trees that already shelter caterpillars, & so to occupy the niche longer & exploit Cecropia resources before colonization by ants.  However, once incipient ant colonies are able to develop, they prevent further colonization by the caterpillars.  Although no higher herbivory rates were noted, these caterpillars are ineffective in protecting their host trees from a pathogenic fungus, Fusarium moniliforme (Deuteromycetes), that develops on the trichilium in the absence of mutualistic ants.  Saplings were also associated with the 2 Cecropia-ant species typical of the area, A. alfari & A. ovaticeps, as well as, unexpectedly, the fire ant Solenopsis saevissima.

    "abstract": "Predators and parasitoids of herbivores can play important roles in plant defense. Plant traits that attract the enemies of herbivores are presumed to have co\u0010evolved with these enemies in obligate relationships such as ant\u0013Acacia mutualisms. In facultative interactions, selection via herbivores' enemies also may shape plant traits, although no study has yet demonstrated all of the necessary criteria to document selection in a single tri\u0010trophic system. Using manipulative experiments during a two\u0010year study, I showed that predatory ants can act as agents of selection on extrafloral nectary (EFN) traits. Wild cotton (Gossypium thurberi) EFNs attract a number of generalist ant species that consume and disturb herbivores. Sire-offspring regression analyses demonstrated that both the proportion of leaves with EFNs and EFN size exhibit heritable variation in G. thurberi. A two\u0010year insecticide experiment revealed that herbivory reduced plant growth and seed production in the field, independently of the effects of ants. Both ant abundance and EFN availability were manipulated in the field using a 2 x 2 factorial design. When ant visitation was reduced, plants supported more herbivores, experienced greater leaf damage, and produced fewer flowers and seeds. Furthermore, fewer ants visited plants with experimentally reduced EFNs; leaf damage was higher and seed number was lower compared to plants with ambient levels of EFN, indicating that EFNs mediate the benefits of ants. In addition, natural variation in EFN frequency correlated positively with seed production. This study provides the strongest support yet that casual ant associates can influence the evolution of extrafloral nectary traits and suggests that plant evolution in facultative mutualisms depends on community\u0010level dynamics.",

Behavioral experiments conducted in 2 populations over 2 years demonstrated that B. thurberiella caterpillars were substantially less likely to damage wild cotton leaves in the presence of ants due to ant-induced changes in caterpillar behavior.  In the absence of ants, caterpillars spent more time stationary (potential feeding time) & less time dropping from leaves by a thread of silk than when ants were present.  Furthermore, ants altered the spatial distribution of both caterpillars & damage.

    "abstract": "Geographic variation in the outcome of interspecific interactions may influence not only the evolutionary trajectories of species but also the structure of local communities. We investigated this community consequence of geographic variation for a facultative mutualism between ants and wild cotton (Gossypium thurberi). Ants consume wild cotton extrafloral nectar and can protect plants from herbivores. We chose three sites that differed in interaction outcome, including a mutualism (ants provided the greatest benefits to plant fitness and responded to manipulations of extrafloral nectar), a potential commensalism (ants increased plant fitness but were unresponsive to extrafloral nectar), and a neutral interaction (ants neither affected plant fitness nor responded to extrafloral nectar). At all sites, we manipulated ants and extrafloral nectar in a factorial design and monitored the abundance, diversity, and composition of other arthropods occurring on wild cotton plants. We predicted that the effects of ants and extrafloral nectar on arthropods would be largest in the location with the mutualism and weakest where the interaction was neutral. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that the presence of ants altered arthropod composition, but only at the two sites in which ants increased plant fitness. At the site with the mutualism, ants also suppressed detritivore/scavenger abundance and increased aphids. The presence of extrafloral nectar increased arthropod abundance where mutual benefits were the strongest, whereas both arthropod abundance and morphospecies richness declined with extrafloral nectar availability at the site with the weakest ant-plant interaction. Some responses were geographically invariable: total arthropod richness and evenness declined by approximately 20% on plants with ants, and extrafloral nectar reduced carnivore abundance when ants were excluded from plants. These results demonstrate that a facultative ant-plant mutualism can alter the composition of arthropod assemblages on plants and that these community-level consequences vary across the landscape.",

Acacia ant colonies engage in lethal contests for resources, in which even eventual victors suffer heavy casualties.

Costs of fighting appear to be offset, and recovery from conflict hastened, by the inclusion of nonrelatives into colonies.          *[We tracked the outcomes of experimentally induced field conflicts between highly territorial acacia ant Crematogaster mimosae colonies.  We provide evidence that the victors of colony fights have reduced worker forces to defend larger territories.

Using molecular genetics, we discovered that fatal fights significantly decrease within-colony worker relatedness.  We find that reduced relatedness can be explained by colonies increasing worker number via non-kin enemy adoption or queen-right colony fusion.

    "abstract": "There are many examples of mutualistic interactions between ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFN). The annual legume Chamaecrista nictitans (Caesalpineaceae) secretes nectar from EFN, specialized structures that attract ants, spiders, and other arthropods. The effects of manipulated C. nictitans patch size and location on plant-ant interactions were tested. Defense from herbivores was not detected; plants with ants did not set significantly more fruit or seed than plants with ants excluded. On the contrary, in one year, plants without ants set more fruit and seed than C. nictitans with ants. The cause of this was not determined. Furthermore, insect herbivore damage was low during three years of observations. Sennius cruentatus (Bruchidae), a specialist seed predator beetle, escaped ant defense despite the presence of numerous ants. Beetle progeny are protected during development by living inside maturing C. nictitans fruit and preventing fruits from dehiscing before emerging as adults. Although ants reduced percent of infestation in 1995, the total number of S. cruentatus per plant was not affected by ants in years of infestation. Overall, larger experimental C. nictitans patches attracted more ants, parasitoid wasps, and percent infestation by S. cruentatus while insect herbivores declined with increasing patch size. Location of patches within fields, however, did not affect numbers of arthropod visitors. Similar to manipulated populations, very little insect herbivory occurred in four reference populations. In contrast to the experimental populations, no S. cruentatus were recovered in reference populations of C. nictitans. Herbivory by insects may not always depress seed set by C. nictitans or may not exceed a threshold level. Thus, herbivory-reduction by ants may not have been detectable in these results. Seed predation may be more influential on C. nictitans reproduction.",

We focused here on specialist plant-ant species of the genus Allomerus that grow a fungus to build galleries on their host-plant stems. Allomerus-inhabited domatia, thus, might be a rich arena for microbes associated with the ants, the plant, and the fungus. We investigated the microbial communities present in domatia colonised by four arboreal ants: Allomerus decemarticulatus, A. octoarticulatus, A. octoarticulatus var. demerarae, and the non-fungus growing plant-ant Azteca sp. cf. depilis, inhabiting Hirtella physophora or Cordia nodosa in French Guiana. We hypothesized that the microbial community will differ among these species. We isolated microorganisms from five colonies of each species, sequenced the 16S rRNA or Internal TranscribedSpacer (ITS) regions, and described both the alpha and beta diversities. We identified 69 microbial taxa, which belong to five bacterial and two fungal phyla. The most diverse phyla were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The microbial community of Azteca cf. depilis and Allomerus spp. differed in composition and richness. Geographical distance affected microbial communities and richness but plant species did not.

    "abstract": "Experimental studies assessing the impact of demographic changes on aggression and inter\u0010group competitive outcomes in communities of social species are rare. This gap in our knowledge is important, not only because social species are foundational elements of many terrestrial ecosystems, but because interference competition among social groups often involves decision\u0010like processes influenced by demographic and environmental contexts. In East Africa, the symbiotic ant Crematogaster mimosae is a co\u0010dominant competitor that engages in high\u0010mortality, intra\u0010 and interspecific battles for sole possession of host trees. We manipulated worker density on C. mimosae Acacia host trees, and the colony's opportunity to expand onto neighboring trees to identify how these factors influenced colony\u0010level aggression, expansion success, and longer\u0010term survivorship. Worker density on focal trees was increased through translocation of domatia\u0010bearing branches, and was decreased using partial tree fumigations. We examined impacts of density manipulations on aggression and immediate expansion success under two different risk scenarios. We tied focal trees to either an experimentally emptied\u0010tree (low\u0010risk treatment), or to a C. nigriceps\u0010occupied tree (high\u0010risk treatment). Expansion success onto emptied neighbor trees was 100% for controls and increased\u0010density colonies, but only 50% for decreased\u0010density colonies, despite the fact that host trees are a limiting resource in this system. Success expanding onto trees occupied by a heterospecific competitor reached 36%, 40%, and 79% in decreased, control, and increased\u0010density trees, respectively. Our results show that changes in worker density due to disturbances or inter\u0010group battles have the potential to disrupt competitive hierarchies. Worker density manipulations also affected longer\u0010term colony persistence. Behavioral and genetic data revealed that 12 months after expansions 100% of the decreased\u0010density colonies, and 25% of control and increased\u0010density colonies, had been supplanted by neighboring opportunistic conspecifics. Intraspecific aggression may have lower costs in C. mimosae because aggressive colonies can incorporate workers or queens from defeated competitors. The unexpectedly high frequency of conflicts between conspecific C. mimosae, in combination with behaviors decreasing the cost of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific conflict, may create opportunities for the survival of subordinate competitors in this ant-plant system.",

The facilitative effect of Larrea tridentata was hypothesized to extend beyond plants to the local insect community in the Mojave Desert. Pan traps were placed under shrubs and in open microsites to test the following predictions: 1) shrub-annual facilitation complexes increase insect abundance, richness, and diversity; and 2) specific insect families or functional groups respond to the shrub-annual facilitation complex more strongly due to increased resources. Abundance, richness, and diversity of the insect communities associated with shrubs were significantly greater in shrub compared to open microsites. The families Sphecidae, Formicidae, Bradynobaenidae and Lauxaniidae were positively associated with shrubs while Scarabaeidae was associated with open microsites. However, there was no difference in the relative abundances of major functional groups, suggesting that the primary pollinators for this ecosystem are not sensitive to differences in floral resources at this scale. This study demonstrates that shrubs facilitate local insect communities and supports the hypothesis that plant-plant facilitation can extend to other trophic levels. Management of desert shrubs is thus an effective means to enhance many components of insect biodiversity.",

Native bees, nonnative honeybees, and microlepidoptera were responsible for the majority of visits to flowers of the three plant species. Ants visited flowers of S. haleakalae and G. cuneatum relatively commonly in ant-invaded zones but were less common or absent on flowers of L. tameiameiae in the same zones. Zones with ants had fewer Hylaeus bees in yellow pan traps than the zone without ants, and overall flower visitation rates to one plant species, G. cuneatum, were six times lower in sites containing ants. In one of two observation years, flower visitation to L. tameiameiae was also reduced in sites containing ants. Results suggest that Argentine ants may cause a reduction of native Hylaeus bee abundances; however, other factors correlated with elevation cannot be ruled out as the cause of differences in Hylaeus abundances across our sites.",

Here we documented the pollination ecology of a shrub, Daphne miyabeana (Thymelaeaceae), that is unpalatable to deer in two different habitats (open and closed canopy) at a site with severe deer browsing. We found that 31.22\t\u00b1\t3.07% (mean\t\u00b1\tSE) and 9.01\t\u00b1\t1.71% of the total number of D. miyabeana flowers become fruits in open and closed habitats, respectively. Although spontaneous selfing was possible, the fruit set of that was much lower than the fruit set of an artificial outcrossing treatment. In the closed habitat, the fruit set of the natural pollination was lower than that of artificial outcrossing, whereas in the open habitat the fruit set of those two were similar. In the open habitat, small bees were the major flower visitors, whereas in the closed habitat, ants were the major flower visitors, which did not contribute to pollination. Our findings suggest that D. miyabeana is pollinated by occasional visits of small bees, but it is also self\u0010compatible and spontaneous selfing is possible. Although its pollination is shaped by abiotic environmental factors, D. miyabeana can reproduce in different habitat conditions. These flexible reproductive systems may be an advantage in coping with the recent environmental change in forest habitats.",

We describe the ecological characteristics of these gardens and consider what factors could have produced the geographic isolation of Eastern Amazonian devil's gardens. Three hypotheses are investigated: (1) the host plant distribution restricts the distribution of the mutualism, (2) the ecological tolerances of Myrmelachista explain the isolation, and (3) the devil's gardens of the Eastern Amazon constitute relicts from ancient forest refugia. The distribution of the possible associated myrmecophytes and previously described ecological ranges of devil's gardens cannot explain their ecological restriction to cloud forests in Eastern Amazonia, but our discovery is consistent with the biogeographic refuge hypothesis (i.e. highlands along the Amazon Basin constitute refugia for humid forests that spread during the Cenozoic). Our finding opens exciting perspectives for comparative studies of the origin, ecology and evolutionary history of this ant-plant mutualism.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of ant-plant mutualistic associations are known to occur in terrestrial ecosystems. Although many species of plants recruit ants to obtain protection from herbivores, myrmecophily is rare, since only few plant species are known to be adapted for pollination predominantly by ants. The annual herb, Euphorbia hirta, is characterized by the \u0018ant-pollination syndrome\u0019 including traits such as unisexual flowers, inconspicuous cyathia clustered in globose cymes, inflorescence-associated tiny nectaries and short, semi-erect stem. In present study, we aimed to examine the pollination ecology of Euphorbia hirta and the role of ants in its pollination. Field and laboratory experiments conducted to understand the association between E. hirta plants and ants revealed that seven ant species (belonging to five genera and three subfamilies) visited E. hirta plants. The visitation patterns of ants revealed that in a single foraging trip the ants visited a number of plants indicating their potential role in cross-pollination. Field-based exclusion experiments revealed production of significantly higher number of fruits in E. hirta plants under open pollination treatment as compared to other treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the adherence of the pollen grains to the bristles located on ant mouth-parts was facilitated by the three vertical, semi-circular grooves present on the grain surface. The number of fruits produced per plant was higher in ant-included plants as compared to only winged insect-pollinated and only self-pollinated plants suggesting that the plant-visiting ants are successful pollination vectors of E. hirta and while promoting self-pollination also contribute towards cross-pollination services.",

The ants are obligate inhabitants of the ant-plant and they nest and reproduce exclusively in this myrmecophyte. However, this mutualistic association often involves a third partner, scale insects (Coccoidea, Hemiptera). Established colonies of this ant are always associated with scale insects and ants appear to be dependent on the honeydew excretions of their trophobionts. Acquisition of scale insects is therefore an important step in the successful establishment of a new colony. Domatia of juvenile host-plants were dissected to determine (1) how colonies are founded, (2) if there was evidence of co-dispersal between trophobionts and foundress queens. Colony foundation is claustral. Founding queens of Pseudomyrmex chew their entrance holes at the prostoma and then close the hole with debris. 104 queens were located with few or no workers. Of the 104 foundresses, 69 were found dead and only 32 had at least a single trophobiont. Although the association with trophobionts may prove vital to the establishment of the colony, these results indicate that scale insects do not seem to co-disperse with the foundress queens.",

In many ant-plant interactions, ants are known to protect their host. However, in the Neotropical ant-plant genus Triplaris, the benefits provided by associated ants have never been tested. Many Pseudomyrmex spp. ants are obligate inhabitants of Triplaris spp. trees. In this study, Triplaris americana was studied in association with Pseudomyrmex dendroicus, an ant highly specific to its host (it has not been collected from any other species of Triplaris). Ant exclusion experiments were carried out to assess the protective effect of ants. In addition, ant behavior was monitored in control plants to study the mechanisms by which ants might confer protection against herbivory. Ant removal led to a more than 15-fold increase in herbivory. Pseudomyrmex dendroicus are active at all times of day and night and aggressively and efficiently remove insect herbivores from their host.",

    "abstract": "We analysed the effect of a hurricane on a plant-ant network and on vegetation cover. Plant cover was sampled using linear sampling in several vegetation types: deciduous forest, a dry forest, sand dune pioneers, sand dune scrub, ecotone of freshwater marsh, deciduous forest and dune scrub, and mangrove forest. We sampled ant-plant interactions and vegetation cover before and after Hurricane Karl hitting (September 2010) the central coast of the state of Veracruz, Mexico. The pre-hurricane network consisted of 16 plant and 25 ant species in 52 associations. The post-hurricane network consisted of 17 plant and 20 ant species in 56 associations. We found a significant decrease in the total linear cover of EFN-bearing plants between October 2009 (646 m, no hurricane effect) and October 2010 (393 m, after hurricane Karl) (total sample length 2025 m). Both networks were significantly nested (0.999 and 0.973, P < 0.001), suggesting that network topology remained similar. Our results show changes in several network characteristics and species proportions. The number of plant species that contributed to nestedness vs. idiosyncratic species did not differ significantly in the pre-hurricane network, while the number of plant species that contributed to nestedness vs. idiosyncratic species did differ significantly in the post-hurricane network. The number of ant species that contributed to nestedness vs. idiosyncratic species differed significantly in the pre-hurricane network, and also in the post-hurricane network. Differences in nestedness contributions of species before and after the hurricane reflect an alteration from a generalized, highly nested, more stable pre-disturbance network, to a more low-degree or specialized network (i.e. fewer interactions among generalist species, those species with the most associations). The maintenance of important core components of the network after a huge disturbance, suggests a short-term resilience typical of mutualistic networks.",

    "abstract": "In exchange for extrafloral nectar, ants deter herbivores from the plants decreasing the herbivore damage, and increasing plant performance in terms of growth and survival. Plants of different sexes may exhibit differences in the investment of resources for defence, thereby differentially decreasing the amount of energy available to other physiological processes. In this context, little is known about sex\u0010related differences in the outcome of ant-plant interactions in plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). In the present study, we conducted ant\u0010exclusion experiments in the field to test for sex\u0010related differences in the outcome of ant-plant interactions in vegetative and reproductive buds of Opuntia robusta in individuals of different sexes in two populations: trioecious and dioecious. We applied tanglefoot to some plant and others were allowed ant access, and measured herbivory, relative growth rates and survival probabilities of buds during the growing season when EFNs are active. We counted the number of ants foraging in EFNs of flowers and cladodes of different sexes. We hypothesized that differences in resource investment to defence between sexes change the outcome of ant-plant interactions in terms of the number of ants foraging on EFNs, herbivory, growth, and survival probabilities. Our results suggest sex\u0010specific strategies in the investment of resources for defence mediated by EFNs in O. robusta, wherein males, females and hermaphrodites from both populations respond differentially to ant presence and herbivores. These sex\u0010related differences affected the outcome of the ant\u0013plant interactions, influencing changes in number of ants foraging on EFNs, and the resulting herbivory, growth and survival of flowers and cladodes among the different sexes and among populations. Our results suggest that the maintenance of EFNs in O. robusta is costly, reflecting some trade\u0010offs between growth/survival and defence. Buds visited by ants tended to grow slowly and survive worse in the trioecious population; in the dioecious population they grew slower but survived better. Overall, a greater number of ants visiting EFNs was related to lower herbivore damage, greater growth and survival of flowers and cladodes. Our study underscores the importance of considering plant sex in the outcome of ant\u0013plant interactions. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.",

    "abstract": "1. Several studies have recently focused on the structure of ecological networks involving ants and plants with extrafloral nectaries; however, little is known about the effects of temporal variation in resource abundance on the structure of ant-plant networks mediated by floral nectar. 2. In this study, it was evaluated how strong seasonality in resource availability in a semi-arid tropical environment affects the structure of ant-flower networks. We recorded ants collecting floral nectar during two seasons (from December 2009 to January 2013): dry and green seasons. Then, we built interaction networks for flower-visiting ants in the Brazilian Caatinga separately for each combination of transect and season. 3. In general, strong seasonality directly influenced patterns of ant-flower interactions and the overall complexity of these ecological networks. During the dry season, networks were more connected, less modular, and exhibited greater niche overlap of flower-visiting ants than during the green season. Moreover, resource utilisation by ants during the dry season tended to be more aggregated. These findings indicate that during the dry season, ant species tended to share many resource bases, probably owing to lower overall resource availability during this season. Species composition of the ant network component was highly season specific; however, a central core of highly generalised ants was present during both seasons. 4. The stability of this central core between seasons could strongly affect the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these interaction networks. This study contributes to the understanding of the structure and dynamics of ant-flower interactions in extremely seasonal environments.",

Twelve of these galls (39%) contained ants.

Farmers identified insect pests as the major production constraints on sweet potato & taro.  Responses elicited from this survey indicated that farmers live with the pest problems.  However, identification of solutions & opportunities by farmers showed the beneficial association between ants & crops.  This study confirms farmer innovation on the mutualistic association between sweet potato & ants, & indigenous knowledge on the 'makum system'.  This is the local name given to taro cultivation on ant hills.  The ants have been identified as Pheidole megacephala.

    "abstract": "Invasions by non-native insects can have important ecological impacts, particularly on island ecosystems. However, the factors that promote the success of invaders relative to co-occurring non-invasive species remain unresolved. For invasive ants, access to carbohydrate resources via interactions with both extrafloral nectary-bearing plants and honeydew-excreting insects may accelerate the invasion process. A first step towards testing this hypothesis is to determine whether invasive ants respond to variation in the availability of carbohydrate resources, and whether this response differs from that of co-occurring, non-invasive ants. We investigated the effect of carbohydrate subsidies on the short-term foraging and hemipteran-tending behaviours of the invasive ant Anoplolepis gracilipes (Formicidae) and co-occurring ant species on an extrafloral nectary-bearing plant by experimentally manipulating carbohydrate levels and tracking ant recruitment. We conducted experiments in 2 years at two sites: one site was invaded by A. gracilipes prior to 2007 and the other became invaded during the course of our study, allowing pre- (2007) and post-invasion (2009) comparisons. Short-term increases in carbohydrate availability increased the density of A. gracilipes workers on plants by as much as 400% and reduced tending of honeydew-excreting insects by this species by up to 89%, with similar responses across years. In contrast, ants at the uninvaded site in 2007 showed a weak and non-significant forager recruitment response. Across all sites, A. gracilipes workers were the only ants that responded to carbohydrate manipulations in 2009. Furthermore, ant-carbohydrate dynamics at a site newly invaded by A. gracilipes quickly diverged from dynamics at uninvaded sites and converged on those of the site with an established invasion. These findings suggest that carbohydrate resources may be particularly important for A. gracilipes invasions, and underscore the importance of species interactions, particularly putative mutualisms, in facilitating exotic species invasions.",

At each site, we manipulated nectar levels on a common extrafloral nectary-bearing shrub & assessed short-term changes in ant worker recruitment & aggression.  We found that the recruitment response of the highly invasive ant species A. gracilipes was not unique: other dominant ant species also increased recruitment in response to increasing nectar levels.  However, A. gracilipes did show unique changes in aggressive behaviors: as nectar levels increased, the proportion of prey discovered, attacked, & removed by A. gracilipes workers & the speed at which they performed these aggressive behaviors all increased strongly.  Other ant species showed no such responses.  In addition, fewer subordinate ants persisted on plants at sites invaded by A. gracilipes.  Finally, plot-level, simultaneous manipulations of ant access to the plants & nectar availability demonstrated that Morinda citrifolia-ant mutualisms influenced the b-diversity of local arthropod communities differently when A. gracilipes dominated local ant assemblages.]",

    "abstract": "*[We describe a novel type of insect-plant interaction where a carnivorous plant uses such an indirect defense to prevent nutrient loss to kleptoparasites.  The ant Camponotus schmitzi is an obligate inhabitant of the carnivorous pitcher plant Nepenthes bicalcarata in Borneo.  It has recently been suggested that this ant-plant interaction is a nutritional mutualism, but the detailed mechanisms and the origin of the ant-derived nutrient supply have remained unexplained.  We confirm that N. bicalcarata host plant leaves naturally have an elevated (15)N/(14)N stable isotope abundance ratio (delta(15)N) when colonized by C. schmitzi.  This indicates that a higher proportion of the plants' nitrogen is insect-derived when C. schmitzi ants are present (ca. 100%, vs. 77% in uncolonized plants) & that more nitrogen is available to them.  We demonstrated direct flux of nutrients from the ants to the host plant in a (15)N pulse-chase experiment.  As C. schmitzi ants only feed on nectar & pitcher contents of their host, the elevated foliar delta(15)N cannot be explained by classic ant-feeding (myrmecotrophy), but must originate from a higher efficiency of the pitcher traps.  We discovered that C. schmitzi ants not only increase the pitchers' capture efficiency by keeping the pitchers' trapping surfaces clean, but they also reduce nutrient loss from the pitchers by preying on dipteran pitcher inhabitants (infauna).  Consequently, nutrients the pitchers would have otherwise lost via emerging flies become available as ant colony waste.  The plants' prey is therefore conserved by the ants.  The interaction between C. schmitzi, N. bicalcarata, & dipteran pitcher infauna represents a new type of mutualism where animals mitigate the damage by nutrient thieves to a plant.]",

    "abstract": "The species richness and composition of ant assemblages at the extrafloral nectaries of four Costus spp. (Zingiberaceae) in Panama were quantified to determine (1) the relative specificity of these ant-plant mutualisms, and (2) the ecological factors that influence ant assemblages. Although inflorescences of Costus spp. commonly produce extrafloral nectar for several months (species means 1-2 mo, range to 4 mo), there was little turnover in ant-species composition on individual inflorescences. A total of 34 ant species in five subfamilies were observed, but plant species varied significantly in ant species richness. The number of ant species expected from equal sampling (40 inflorescences per Costus sp.) was 9 for C. pulverulentus, 13 for C. scaber, 15 for C. allenii, and 20 for C. laevis. Among-species differences in ant species richness were not a function of plant distribution, the volume or composition of extrafloral nectar, or the duration of nectar flow. The number of ant species was positively correlated with inflorescence height, which varied from 0.6 to 2.0 m. The differences in ant species richness with inflorescence height were due primarily to the addition of arboreal ants, which increased from 3 species representing 3% of all ant species observations on the shortest plant, C. pulverulentus, to 12 species representing 62% of all ant observations on the tallest plant, C. laevis. The number of terrestrial ant species varied only from six to eight. Cumulative ant\u0014species curves as a function of number of inflorescences sampled (N = 41-80) did not plateau for any Costus sp., indicating that a large number of ant species can utilize extrafloral nectar in this system. The high ant species richness and the similarity in nectar characteristics among Costus spp. suggest these are relatively generalized mutualisms with limited coevolution between the plants and their attendant ants. The brief period of extrafloral nectar production (\u221e = 36\u001455 d), coupled with spatial variation in ant species distributions, probably limit the degree of specialization among mutualists. This is in contrast to more specialized antplant mutualisms where plants are relatively predictable sources of food and/or nest sites for ants.",

    "abstract": "We used path analysis to estimate the direct and indirect effects of antguards, an ant\u0014tended herbivore, and pollinators, on flower and fruit production in Calathea ovandensis, a neotropical herb. The natural variation in these plant\u0014animal interactions was quantified for individual plants in Veracruz, Mexico in 1984 and 1985. We conclude that variation in plant\u0014animal interactions has significant, and complex, effects on flower and fruit production in this species. Antguards had a positive direct effect on flower number in both years, and because of the positive effect of flower number on fruit number, had a positive indirect effect on mature fruit number. The herbivore had a negative direct effect on flower number and mature fruit number in both years. Thus, direct and indirect effects contribute to the large negative effect of herbivores on mature fruit number. The composition of the pollinator community was very different in the two years, with a marked increase in the number of visits by efficient pollinators in 1985. This change was reflected in between\u0014year differences in the effects of pollinators on number of initiated fruits. In 1984, pollinators had no significant effect on initiated fruit number, while the two pollinators that increased in abundance in 1985 had significant effects on initiated fruit number in that year. These results are consistent with experimental data for 1985, which indicate that supplemental pollination causes a significant increase in the number of fruit initiated. While pollinators may limit the number of fruit initiated in some years, our observational and experimental data suggest that number of mature fruits is primarily limited by resources, not by pollination.          *[Antguards had a positive effect on flower number.]",

    "abstract": "*[Through a series of experiments operating on a multitrophic network, we aimed to understand whether the impact of the ant Formica pratensis towards the other organisms, could be influenced by the composition of the network in which these species interact & by the ants behavior to aphids.  Organisms that composed our network were the cucumber plant (Cucumis sativus L.cv Hoffman's giganta), infested by the mutualistic aphid Aphis gossypii Glover (Homoptera: Aphididae) or by the non mutualistic aphid Myzus persicae Sulzer (Homoptera: Aphididae), by the chewing feeder Mamestra brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), & by the aphidophagous predator Aphidoletes aphidimyza R. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae).  Experiments on ant aggression showed that ants have a high predatory potential, completely eradicating the caterpillars on plants.  The level of aggression does not increase in the presence of aphids mutualists that should be protected from competitors.  The ants also are not able to suppress the predator of aphids, that we hypothesize to utilize chemical camouflage, acquiring the smells of the aphids on which they feed.  We also investigated the response to herbivory by insects, as some plants produce volatiles that attract the natural enemies of the herbivores.  Using an open T-olfactometer, we investigated responses of the ant Formica pratensis to volatiles emitted by cucumber & potato plants.  Cucumbers were infested by the mutualistic aphid Aphis gossypii or by the non mutualistic aphid Myzus persicae, by the chewing feeder Mamestra brassicae or by the association of A. gossypii & M. brassicae.  Potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Bintje) was infested by the same aphids species used for cucumbers, by the chewing feeder Chrysodeixis chalcites Esper (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), or by the association of A. gossypii & C. chalcites.  In dual choice experiments, F. pratensis showed interest to volatiles of cucumber plants infested with chewing caterpillars of M. brassicae alone or in association with A gossypii, over volatiles of undamaged plants or plants damaged by A. gossypii.  No statistical relevance was found in the choice between A. gossypii or M. persicae over undamaged plants.  The attraction toward damaged plant volatiles is greater with potato plants.  In this case, ants follow the herbivory induced plant volatiles cue of damaged plants either with the chewing feeder C. chalcites, or the sap feeders A. gossypii & M. persicae, over undamaged plants.  No choice were shown between potato plants infested with A. gossypii and C. chalcites, over plants infested with A gossypii only.  Results shown that ants can react to volatiles emitted by the 2 plants.  Chewing feeders induce VOC production that results in ant interest in both the plant species tested.  Only in the case of potato plants, did aphids induced VOC emissions that induces ant interest.]",

Although ants are important components of natural and agro-ecosystems, the importance of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) as cues for ants for finding food sources have received little attention. We investigated responses of the ant Formica pratensis to volatiles emitted by uninfested and insect-infested cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants. Cucumber plants were infested by the phloem-feeding aphid Aphis gossypii, the leaf chewer Mamestra brassicae or simultaneously by both insects. Potato plants were infested by either Aphis gossypii, by the leaf chewer Chrysodeixis chalcites or both. In olfactometer experiments, ants preferred volatile blends emitted by cucumber plants infested with M. brassicae caterpillars alone or combined with A. gossypii to volatiles of undamaged plants or plants damaged by A. gossypii only. No preference was recorded in choice tests between volatiles released by aphid-infested plants over undamaged plants. Volatiles emitted by potato plants infested by either C. chalcites or A. gossypii were preferred by ants over volatiles released by undamaged plants. Ants did not discriminate between potato plants infested with aphids and caterpillars over plants infested with aphids only. Plant headspace composition showed qualitative and/or quantitative differences between herbivore treatments. Multivariate analysis revealed clear separation between uninfested and infested plants and among herbivore treatments. The importance of HIPVs in indirect plant defence by ants is discussed in the context of the ecology of ant-plant interactions and possible roles of ants in pest management.",

We recorded the species spectrum & frequency of ants on inflorescences by examining more than 200 plants in 3 habitats to assess whether they were specifically associated to the bromeliad flowers.  We recorded up to 36 associated ant species at A. lindenii & 7 at A. nudicaulis, with non-plateauing species accumulation curves.  Three species richness estimators (ICE, Jack2, & Chao2) indicated 40-46 species for A. lindenii in secondary forest.  Species of Crematogaster and/or Camponotus were always among the most frequent.  To explain the association of bromeliad flowers with such a high richness of ant species, we tested 2 hypotheses: ants exploit extrafloral nectar on the flowers or ants hunt for abundant hummingbird-transported flower mites that likely effect plant reproduction by feeding on nectar & pollen.  After excluding all flower visitors, we recorded for the first time the production of extrafloral nectar at the sepal tips of the 2 Aechmea species from early buds to the early fruiting period.  Ants were present at 88% of all inflorescences during that period.  In contrast, flower mites could only be found as soon as the first flowers had opened, that is, when the inflorescences had already been visited by ants for several days.  Quantitative behavioral analyses of worker ants on A. lindenii inflorescences revealed that they spent 42% of their time inspecting the sepal tips.  Preying on mites was rarely observed.]",

The branches of T. macrophyllum are partially hollow stems with natural openings, parts of the branch split, leaving a natural entrance hole, serving as domatia for ants.  About 85 % of the ants belong to four genera, the 2 most significant are Crematogaster & Azteca, while Pachycondyla & Pheidole are of minor importance.  At tree heights between 1 & 4 m, a succession of ant colonization takes place, leaving Crematogaster & Azteca the most successful inhabitants, together occupying 70% of the investigated trees.  Only 15 % of the investigated trees were occupied exclusively by Pachycondyla and/or Pheidole.  These ants were neither observed to defend their host tree nor to tend coccids.  These species seem to have neither a positive nor a negative effect to their host.  In contrast, Crematogaster & Azteca defend their host, reduce herbivory by approximately 50% & tend coccids.  Both Crematogaster & Azteca produce carton structures to seal the natural entrance holes & to protect their coccids.  In case of Azteca, extensive carton galleries are constructed that connect all occupied domatium chambers.  These carton tunnels are situated at the lower side ofthe branches & contain many tiny holes just big enough for the ants to enter.  The low presence of epiphytes on Azteca-occupied trees seems to be connected with the presence of the extensive carton galleries.  Experiments showed that Azteca ants remove material from the plant's surface to construct & repair their carton tunnels.  The defense strategies between Crematogaster & Azteca differ notably.  Crematogaster ants simply attack leaf beetles & other herbivores on the plant's surface & remove lianas.  Azteca shows a more unusual & so far unknown defense strategy.  The extensive carton galleries are used to protect their host from other insects, especially Atta sp. leaf-cutter ants.  If Atta ants enter an Azteca-occupied tree, the workers & soldiers place themselves with open mandibles inside the carton tunnel close to the holes.  When crossing the carton tunnel, the Atta ants almost inevitably step into one of the holes & are caught by the Azteca ants.  In an experiment, more than half of the Atta ants placed on a twig with Azteca-galleries got trapped by Azteca within 30 minutes.  The trapped ants are either dropped to the ground or dragged into the nest, serving probably as an additional food source.  In that way T. macrophyllum is well protected against the risk of leaf-cutter attacks.  This protection is restricted to trees in primary forest because Crematogaster & Azteca ants are completely absent in secondary forest, where Pheidole & other ant species are most common.]",

    "abstract": "The genus Acrotriche is a group of predominantly winter flowering Australian native plants with small flowers that use a unique method of secondary pollen presentation. The mating system of one species has been determined as requiring transfer of pollen from one plant to another to enable effective pollination and floral conformity in other species suggests similar breeding systems. Previous authors have suggested non-flying mammal pollination for members of the genus based on floral traits and reports of floral consumption; however, this hypothesis does not stand up to scrutiny. Acrotriche floral traits can also be interpreted as indicative of crawling invertebrate pollination. The identification of floral visitors and their potential for pollination has not been conducted previously for any Acrotriche species. To identify potential pollinators, the floral visitors to six different species of Acrotriche were observed throughout an entire 24 h period at a range of sites throughout South Australia. Ants were identified as the most common and abundant floral visitors for all Acrotriche species. Ant pollination is considered rare due to the negative effects that ant secretions can have on pollen viability. To determine these effects in relation to Acrotriche, pollen germination experiments were undertaken after contact with the integument of several ant species. Reductions in pollen viability varied between plants and ant species but in all experiments viable pollen remained after ant contact. These results, along with observed behaviour of ant visitors, indicate that ants may contribute to pollination in Acrotriche.",

    "abstract": "AIM: We ask empirically how the strength of the three major interactions - predation, competition and mutualism - changes with increasing island area. We review and expand current theory concerning these relationships. LOCATION: Data for evaluating this question come from several Bahamian archipelagos and involve both experiments and observations. The latter can be especially long term; in one case data were collected over a 17\u0010year period. METHODS: We analyse the effect size of the following interactions across a range of island areas: (1) predation by lizards on spiders, (2) competition between two lizard species, (3) competition between two spider species, (4) ant-plant mutualism, and (5) plant-pollinator mutualism. RESULTS: Effect sizes for predation and competition mostly show a hump\u0010shaped relationship with island area. Effect sizes for ant-plant mutualism were reduced on large islands compared with smaller islands. Germination rate showed a steady increase with island area which we infer to be caused by an increase in pollinator limitation on smaller islands. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We argue that the effect size-area relation has rather similar aetiologies for predation, competition and to a somewhat lesser extent ant-plant mutualism. Specifically, we suggest that high species diversity, top predators, plant defences and (for predation and competition) spatial heterogeneity with respect to refuges or resource use reduce effect size on large islands, while harsh abiotic conditions, marine subsidies and stochastic events reduce effect size on small islands. Thus, for these interaction types, the greatest effect sizes are observed on intermediate\u0010sized islands. For plant-pollinator mutualism we suggest that the monotonic increase in effect size with increasing island area is the result of interaction strength being enhanced, rather than weakened, by diversity.",

We show in detail that the presence of the awn & the drilling mechanism of S. tenacissima reduce the intake rate of diaspores by Messor spp. dramatically.  The long awn (mean overall length 56.8 mm) makes the diaspore cumbersome & heavier, so that it can only be retrieved much more slowly than a diaspore without the awn.  Cutting of the awn by an ant requires a long time (mean 9.35 min) & small workers (head width less than 1.3 mm) are incapable of it altogether.  Diaspores drilled into the ground can still be excavated by workers.  However, once the awn breaks off by weathering at the distinct preformed breaking point at the base of the awn, diaspores have practically escaped predation because ants cannot locate them underneath the soil surface.]",

Thus the interaction is directly beneficial to Cecropia juveniles.The difference in growth is associated with differences in herbivory and vine cover. Removal of ants significantly increases nocturnal Coleoptera herbivory on unoccupied plants. In contrast to the influence on beetle numbers, Azteca are ineffective against Homoptera and cecidomyiid gall flies. Although ant-occupied saplings had less chewing herbivore damage throughout the study, the ants were more effective protectors in the dry season than in the rainy season, when herbivore pressure increased. In addition to reducing herbivory, Azteca efficiently remove vines from occupied saplings.   (abstract provided by AM)",

    "abstract": "Discussion (in part): \u00a5Our estimate that one-third of the woody dicotyledons, lianas, and herbaceous vines are ant-defended is the highest figure yet reported for any flora. This high frequency of ant-defended species is especially significant since we did not inspect the reproductive tissues of the plants in our survey. For this reason, and those given above, we suspect that our strikingly high frequency actually underestimates the true frequency of ant-defended species on BCI by several percent, or more. (...) Our results support the contention that extrafloral nectaries are more common in moist tropical than in temperate floras. (....) In our survey, species with extrafloral nectaries were not independently distributed among taxa, a pattern which has been found in other surveys as well (Elias 1983; Lersten and Brubaker 1987; McKey 1989). The vast majority of genera (87%) represented by more than one species in our survey contained either all ant-defended species or no species that were ant-defended. Phylogenetic dependency occurred at higher taxonomic levels as well. (...) Several lines of evidence suggest that the taxonomic distribution of ant defence is the product of both phylogeny and convergent selection. (...) Our finding that families which tend to be ant-defended also tend to be gap-requiring, further supports the notion that the taxonomic distribution of ant defence is not simply an outcome of phylogeny. (....) Recent evidence and newly emerging theory on the quantitative and qualitative allocation of resources to anti-herbivore defence suggest that the distributions of particular defence strategies are functions of resource availability. (...) Ant defence is more likely to be a viable form of defence for gap species than for shade-tolerant species simply because of the contemporary and evolutionary responses to the availability of light. This argument is compatible with McKey\u00a5s (1989) suggestion, supported by our results, that the prevalence of ant-defended lianas may simply reflect the tendency of lianas to be gap species (Putz 1984) with more continuous leaf production than trees and shrubs (Putz and Windsor 1987).\u00a5.             *[with appendix: list of characteristics of 243 dicotyledons and herbaceous vines of Barro Colorado Island surveyed for the presence of ant attractants.]",

Notably, antibiotic-producing actinomycete bacteria represent a tiny fraction of the cuticular microbiomes of both Allomerus & Tetraponera spp. & instead they are dominated by gamma-proteobacteria Erwinia & Serratia spp.  Both these phyla are known to contain antibiotic-producing species which might therefore play a protective role in these ant-plant systems.]",

Field experiments demonstrated that presence of a specialist insect herbivore Edessa rufomarginata (Pentatomidae), or of the non-aggressive Cephalotes pusillus, did not effect oviposition by E. bechina females compared to insect-free control branches.  On the other hand, there was a significant reduction in oviposition frequency on branches with either of 2 aggressive Camponotus species compared to insect-free control branches.  Avoidance of plant locations occupied by such aggressive ants persists even under high levels of oviposition sites demand by the females of the local population.

In laboratory tests, we showed that shelter construction was the more frequent & most efficient defense of Lepidoptera larvae to avoid ant attack.  Other traits such as larval body size were important to predict ant attack, but its effect varied with ant species.  Larvae may negatively respond to the presence of some aggressive ant groups & not be affected by innocuous ants, but this response may be affected by the specific defensive set of larvae.  We also carried out field samplings of both lepidopteran larvae & foraging ants in 4 fragments of Cerrado (SE Brazil), & we found that the foraging intensity of ants had a negative effect on the probability of finding larvae on plants.  We show here that interactions between ants & plants vary across space, both in how ants use resources present on plants, but also in how they affect herbivorous presence.  Localities with higher ant density were also places with low larval abundance.  The presence of liquid food resources on plants may be a factor mediating ant effects, & the groups of ants that better responded to those resources were also the ones with higher effect on caterpillar presence.  However, ant response to liquid food resources on plants are dependent on local conditions & vary across space.  Which ants are present locally & the way that they use plant resources may affect host plant use by lepidopteran larvae, as well as the defensive sets that those larvae may present.  This evidence suggest that the importance of the ant-plant mutualism in terms of benefits for both organisms is highly dependent on the characteristics of local communities & vary on space.  As consequence, the outcome of ant-plant interaction & specifically the function of ants as plant body guards & the potential benefits for plants of herbivory reduction may be higher in some communities & small or even null in others.]          *[Dorymyrmex misspelled Dorimyrmex; Ectatomma inconsistently misspelled Ectatoma; Pseudomyrmex inconsistently misspelled Pseudomyermex.]",

    "abstract": "Ant dominance in tropical ecosystems can be explained by a capacity to exploit liquid foods such as extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and secretions from honeydew-producing hemipterans (HPHs). Such nutritious exudates may determine ant distribution in space and shape specialization in ant-plant interactions. We provide a first assessment of how EFNs and HPHs mediate the structure of ant assemblages, ant visitation intensity, and characteristics of ant-plant interaction networks across space in Brazilian \"cerrado\" savanna. We used arboreal pitfall traps to sample visiting ants in four cerrado localities and recorded the presence of lepidopteran larvae to determine their possible response to ant visitation. Ant species composition and richness did not differ regardless of the presence of liquid rewards on plants, and most network patterns did not show consistent differences. However, in two of the four sites, ant densities were higher on plants with HPHs or EFNs due to increased activity by Camponotus and Pseudomyrmex ants. At these two sites, plants with liquid food sources had a more specific ant assemblage (higher specialization d') than did plants without resources, and caterpillars were more frequently found on plants with fewer workers of Camponotus and Pseudomyrmex. Plants with HPHs had increased ant visitation and accumulated more ant species than did plants with EFNs or without liquid foods. Ant response to such food sources may thus depend on local conditions and identity of ant species, and may determine how ant assemblages are structured. Results highlight how different patterns of ant visitation to liquid resources can produce distinctive effects on herbivore infestation.          **In Table A1, Wasmannia auropunctata misspelled as Wasmania auropunctata.

    "abstract": "Ant foraging on foliage can substantially affect how phytophagous insects use host plants and represents a high predation risk for caterpillars, which are important folivores. Ant-plant-herbivore interactions are especially pervasive in cerrado savanna due to continuous ant visitation to liquid food sources on foliage (extrafloral nectaries, insect honeydew). While searching for liquid rewards on plants, aggressive ants frequently attack or kill insect herbivores, decreasing their numbers.  Because ants vary in diet and aggressiveness, their effect on herbivores also varies. Additionally, the differential occurrence of ant attractants (plant and insect exudates) on foliage produces variable levels of ant foraging within local floras and among localities. Here, we investigate how variation of ant communities and of traits among host plant species (presence or absence of ant attractants) can change the effect of carnivores (predatory ants) on herbivore communities (caterpillars) in a cerrado savanna landscape.  We sampled caterpillars and foliage-foraging ants in four cerrado localities (70-460 km apart). We found that: (i) caterpillar infestation was negatively related with ant visitation to plants; (ii) this relationship depended on local ant abundance and species composition, and on local preference by ants for plants with liquid attractants; (iii) this was not related to local plant richness or plant size; (iv) the relationship between the presence of ant attractants and caterpillar abundance varied among sites from negative to neutral; and (v) caterpillars feeding on plants with ant attractants are more resistant to ant predation than those feeding on plants lacking attractants.  Liquid food on foliage mediates host plant quality for lepidopterans by promoting generalized ant-caterpillar antagonism. Our study in cerrado shows that the negative effects of generalist predatory ants on herbivores are detectable at a community level, affecting patterns of abundance and host plant use by lepidopterans.  The magnitude of ant-induced effects on caterpillar occurrence across the cerrado landscape may depend on how ants use plants locally and how they respond to liquid food on plants at different habitats. This study enhances the relevance of plant-ant and ant-herbivore interactions in cerrado and highlights the importance of a tritrophic perspective in this ant-rich environment.",

    "abstract": "1. Predatory ants may reduce infestation by herbivorous insects, and slow-moving Lepidopteran larvae are often vulnerable on foliage. We investigate whether caterpillars with morphological or behavioural defences have decreased risk of falling prey to ants, and if defence traits mediate host plant use in ant-rich cerrado savanna. 2. Caterpillars were surveyed in four cerrado localities in southeast Brazil (70-460 km apart). The efficacy of caterpillar defensive traits against predation by two common ant species (Camponotus crassus, C. renggeri) was assessed through experimental trials using caterpillars of different species and captive ant colonies. 3. Although ant presence can reduce caterpillar infestation, the ants' predatory effects depend on caterpillar defence traits. Shelter construction and morphological defences can prevent ant attacks (primary defence), but once exposed or discovered by ants, caterpillars rely on their size and/or behaviour to survive (secondary defence). 4. Defence efficiency depends on ant identity: C. renggeri was more aggressive and lethal to caterpillars than C. crassus. Caterpillars without morphological defences or inside open shelters were found on plants with decreased ant numbers. No unsheltered caterpillar was found on plants with extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). Caterpillars using EFN-bearing plants lived in closed shelters or presented morphological defences (hairs, spines), and were less frequently attacked by ants during trials. 5. The efficiency of defences against ants is thus crucial for caterpillar survival and determines host plant use by lepidopterans in cerrado. Our study highlights the effect of EFN-mediated ant-plant interactions on host plant use by insect herbivores, emphasizing the importance of a tritrophic viewpoint in risky environments.",

But, due to their complexity, these effects are often considered separately and their relative strength, acting simultaneously, remains unknown. In a semi\u0010natural field experiment using tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) and the specialised tansy\u0010aphid Metopeurum fuscoviride Stroyan as a model system, we compared the effects of four distinct plant chemotypes (i.e., bottom\u0010up), defined by the bouquet of their volatile terpenoids, on aphid population dynamics by manipulating the presence/absence of mutualistic ants and presence/absence of naturally occurring predators (i.e., top\u0010down). Predators reduced aphid abundance and colony survival but did not reduce initial growth rate due to a time\u0010lag until predators arrived on the plants. Ants directly benefited initial aphid growth rates and abundance, even in the absence of predators, but not the number of days an aphid colony persisted on the plant. Plant chemotype directly affected aphid growth rate and final abundances across the different plants and indirectly affected the abundances of tending ants and predators through effects on aphids. We found that tending ants were more abundant on one plant chemotype. Although ant abundance did not affect aphid population development, it became clear that ants had a preference towards aphids on certain chemotypes. However, a higher number of predators led to a lower number of aphids. The results confirm the importance of plant chemical variation, acting through multiple effects on many species in arthropod communities, and support results from field studies. In a natural population, with a diverse selection of host\u0010plant variants, aphid populations and their interacting species can therefore be structured at the level of an individual plant. Specialist aphids on patchily distributed host plants can exhibit metacommunity dynamics at very local scales. Plant within\u0010species variation within a local population is often ignored in metacommunity ecology, yet our work shows that this can have strong effects on insect\u0013ant\u0013natural enemy dynamics, and therefore, future research should incorporate this into current theory and experimental studies.

    "abstract": "Although disturbance theory has been recognized as a useful framework in examining the stability of ant-plant mutualisms, very few studies have examined the effects of fire disturbance on these mutualisms. In myrmecophyte\u0010dominated savannas, fire and herbivory are key drivers that could influence ant-plant mutualisms by causing complete colony mortality and/or decreasing colony size, which potentially could alter dominance hierarchies if subordinate species are more fire resilient. We used a large\u0010scale, replicated fire experiment to examine long\u0010term effects of fire on acacia-ant community composition. To determine if fire shifted ant occupancy from a competitive dominant to a subordinate ant species, we surveyed the acacia-ant community in 6-7 yr old burn sites and examined how the spatial scale of these burns influenced ant community responses. We then used two short\u0010term fire experiments to explore possible mechanisms for the shifts in community patterns observed. Because survival of ant colonies is largely dependent on their ability to detect and escape an approaching fire, we first tested the evacuation response of all four ant species when exposed to smoke (fire signal). Then to better understand how fire and its interaction with large mammal herbivory affect the density of ants per tree, we quantified ant worker density in small prescribed burns within herbivore exclusion plots. We found clear evidence suggesting that fire disturbance favored the subordinate ant Crematogaster nigriceps more than the dominant and strong mutualist ant C. mimosae, whereby C. nigriceps (1) was the only species to occupy a greater proportion of trees in 6-7 yr old burn sites compared to unburned sites, (2) had higher burn/unburn tree ratios with increasing burn size, and (3) evacuated significantly faster than C. mimosae in the presence of smoke. Fire and herbivory had opposite effects on ant density per meter of branch for both C. nigriceps and C. mimosae, with fire decreasing ant densities per meter of branch and the presence of large herbivores increasing ant density. Taken together, these experiments suggest that major ecosystem disturbances like fire can disrupt mutualistic associations and maintain diversity in partner quality and identity despite a clear dominance hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "Seed dispersal by ants (i.e. myrmecochory) is usually considered as a mutualism: ants feed on nutritive bodies, called elaiosomes, before rejecting and dispersing seeds in their nest surroundings. While mechanisms of plant dispersal in the field are well documented, the behaviour of the ant partner was rarely investigated in details. Here, we compared in laboratory conditions the foraging behaviour of two ant species, the omnivorous Lasius niger and the insectivorous Myrmica rubra to which seeds of two European myrmecochorous plants (Chelidonium majus and Viola odorata) were given. Ant colonies were simultaneously presented three types of items: entire seeds with elaiosome (SE), seeds without elaiosome (S) and detached elaiosomes (E). The presence of elaiosomes on seeds did not attract workers from a distance since ants first contact equally each type of items. Although ants are mass-recruiting species, we never observed any recruitment nor trail-laying behaviour towards seeds.For ants having contacted seed items, their antennation, manipulation and seed retrieval behaviour strongly varied depending on the species of each partner. Antennation behaviour, followed by a loss of contact, was the most frequent ant-seed interaction and can be considered as a 'hesitation' clue. For both plant species, insectivorous Myrmica ants removed items in larger number and at higher speed than Lasius. This fits with the hypothesis of a convergence between odours of elaiosomes and insect preys. For both ant species, the small Chelidonium seeds were retrieved in higher proportion than Viola ones, confirming the hypothesis that ants prefer the higher elaiosome/diaspore-ratio. Thus, in these crossed experiments, the ant-plant pair Myrmica/Chelidonium was the most effective as ants removed quickly almost all items after a few antennations. The presence of an elaiosome body increased the seed removal by ants excepting for Myrmica which retrieved all Chelidonium seeds, even those deprived of their elaiosome. After 24 h, all the retrieved seeds were rejected out of the nest to the refuse piles. In at least half of these rejected items, the elaiosome was discarded by ants. Species-specific patterns and behavioural differences in the dynamics of myrmecochory are discussed at the light of ant ecology.",

    "abstract": "*[In Peninsular Malaysia, 10 species of lycaenid butterflies use leaf flushes or inflorescences of Saraca thaipingensis, a legume tree, for their larval host-plant.  Resource partitioning among these species  is regulated by a complex mixture of interaction patterns with ants.  Females of obligate myrmecophile species lay their eggs exclusively on trees colonized by their specific host ants.  On trees colonized by Oecophylla weaver ants, only specialist mutualists adapted to these territorial ants are able to survive, while larvae of other species are killed.  The formicine Cladomyrma petalae, which inhabits hollow twigs of the myrmecophytic host-plant, likewise precludes oviposition by female butterflies.  Lycaenid larvae confronted with this ant species never survive, but Jamides caeruleus, a concealed feeding species, escapes predation because of its larval cryptic life-habits.  Two facultative myrmecophiles associate in a mutualistic way with a wide and largely overlapping range of ant genera which forage at the extrafloral nectaries of leaf flushes.   Cheritra freja is not a myrmecophile, but is tolerated by all but the most territorial ants.  Ant-dependent host-plant selection and egg-clustering characterize the obligate myrmecophiles, whereas facultative myrmecophiles and the non-myrmecophiles distribute their eggs singly over appropriate host-plants.  Signals mediating caterpillar-ant communication are highly specialized in Drupadia theda, an obligate myrmecophile, but rather unspecific in 4 other species tested.   Altogether our observations indicate that colonization and establishment of lycaenid butterflies on S. thaipingensis trees are governed by specializations as well as opportunistic use of the resources of ants and host-plant parts.  The diversity of this species assemblage is maintained by deterministic as well as stochastic factors.]",

Plant-pollinator observations made in March 2008 and 2009 were used to describe the pollination network for Ka'ena Point, one of Hawai'i\u0019s best-conserved coastal communities. The network includes 15 native plant species, two native bee species, and 26 nonnative insect taxa, forming 119 interactions. Network connectance is 29.4% and weighted nestedness is 17.9, which are similar to values of other dry-habitat, island networks. The network's structure has a core of generalized pollinators plus several more-specialized pollinators. Nearly all plant species interact with two or more generalist pollinators and a variable number of specialists. Small, nonnative bees (Lasioglossum, Ceratina), wasps (Proconura), and flies (mostly Tachinidae) were responsible for 72.7% of flower visits, and they visit five plant species not visited by native bees. The two native visitors were the bees Hylaeus anthracinus and H. longiceps (both proposed as endangered). Hylaeus spp. (especially females) provided 19.8% of flower visits, foraging at high visitation rates and on many species, including the endangered Scaevola coriacea and Sesbania tomentosa. In Hawai'i's coastal habitat, nonnative insects form novel interactions with native species and may maintain an ecosystem\u0019s function following loss of most of the original native pollinators. However, their high visitation rates suggest that the two remaining native Hylaeus species are potentially important pollinators for many of the native plants on which they rely for nectar and pollen resources.          *[Ants visited all plant species & were recorded 945 times out of 2,072 observations of flower visitors across both years.  Ants were removed from the analysis because they are rarely pollinators.  However, other insect interactions in the community could be affected by ants.  Ants could be removing floral resources or physically interfering with pollinators on flowers & could decrease pollinator populations in the habitat.]",

Of all the 16 ant species that inhabit the domatia of H. brunonis at several sites, the plant is only protected by T. albipes.  We show that only the southernmost population (Solaikolli) in protected by the ant species T. albipes.

In comparison, T. albipes is found in low abundance both in the domatia & in the terrestrial stratum in the site Sampaji & does not protect extrafloral nectary producing plant parts of H. brunonis at this site.  We have also experimentally shown that the young leaves of H. brunonis at this southernmost site Solaikolli are protected to a greater extent than the floral bud inflorescences, since T. albipes preferentially utilized extrafloral nectar produced by young leaves compared to extrafloral nectar produced by floral buds at this site.  We have also shown that the floral buds of H. brunonis in the northernmost site are unprotected for 2 reasons.  The first is the absence of the protective ant species T.albipes at this site. Second, the extrafloral nectar produced by some of floral buds at this site is differentially utilized to a much lower extent than floral buds from other sites due to extrafloral nectar from Agumbe being more-than 400-fold more viscous than the extrafloral nectar produced by floral buds at the other 2 sites (Sampaji & Solaikolli).]",

We found that the pollinating bee Braunsapis puangensis breeds within the caulinary domatia of the semi-myrmecophyte Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae), an unusual ant-plant that is polymorphic for the presence of domatia and harbours a diverse invertebrate fauna including protective and non-protective ants in its domatia. B. puangensis is the most common flower visitor that carries the highest proportion of H. brunonis pollen. This myrmecophyte is pollen limited and cross-pollinated by bees in the daytime. Hence, the symbiotic pollinator could provide a benefit to trees bearing domatia by alleviating this limitation. We therefore report for the first time an unspecialized mutualism in which a pollinator is housed in a plant structure other than flowers. Here, the cost to the plant is lower than for conventional brood-site pollination mutualisms where the pollinator develops at the expense of plant reproductive structures.  Myrmecophytes housing resident pollinators are unusual, as ants are known to be enemies of pollinators, and housing them together may decrease the benefits that these residents could individually provide to the host plant.          *[No specific ant species mentioned.]",

    "abstract": "Interactions between potentially mutualistic partners can vary over geographic areas. Myrmecophytes, which are plants harboring ants, often do not exhibit sufficient intraspecific variability to permit comparative studies of myrmecophytic traits over space or time. Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae), a dominant, endemic myrmecophyte of the Indian Western Ghats, is unique in exhibiting considerable variability in myrmecophytic traits, e.g. domatia presence, as well as domatia occupancy and associated ant diversity throughout its geographic range. Although its caulinary domatia are occupied by at least 16 ant species throughout its distribution, young leaves and floral buds producing extrafloral nectar (EFN) are protected by ants from herbivory only in the southernmost region, where Technomyrmex albipes (Dolichoderinae) is the most abundant ant species. The extent of protection by ants was positively related to local species richness of ants and their occupancy of domatia. On the other hand, the highest abundance of interlopers in the domatia, including non-protective ants, the arboreal earthworm Perionyx pullus, and other invertebrates, occurred in sites with the least protection from herbivory by ants. Whereas domatia morphometry did not vary between sites, domatia occupied by protective ants and invertebrate interlopers were longer and broader than empty ones at all sites. The lowest percentage of empty domatia was found at the southernmost site. There was a progressive decline in ant species richness from that found at the sites, to that feeding on H. brunonis EFN, to that occupying domatia, possibly indicating constraints in the interactions with the plants at various levels. Our study of this dominant myrmecophyte emphasizes the impact of local factors such as the availability of suitable ant partners, domatia occupancy, and the presence of interlopers on the emergence of a protection mutualism between ants and plants.",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant interactions often are mediated by extrafloral nectar (EFN) composition that may influence plant visitation by ants. Over a 300 km range in the Indian Western Ghats, we investigated the correlation between the EFN composition of the myrmecophytic ant-plant Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae) and the number and species of ants visiting EFN. EFN composition varied among H. brunonis populations and between plant organs (floral bud vs. young leaf EFN). In general, EFN was rich in sugars with small quantities of amino acids, especially essential amino acids, and had moderate invertase activity. In experiments at the study sites with sugar and amino acid solutions and with leaf or floral bud EFN mimics, dominant EFN-feeding ants differentiated between solutions as well as between mimics. The castration parasite Crematogaster dohrni (northern study site) was the least selective and did not exhibit any clear feeding preferences, while the largely trophobiont-tending non-protective Myrmicaria brunnea (middle study site) preferred higher sucrose concentrations and certain essential/non-essential amino acid mixtures. The mutualistic Technomyrmex albipes (southern study site) preferred sucrose over glucose or fructose solutions and consumed the leaf EFN mimic to a greater extent than the floral bud EFN mimic. This young leaf EFN mimic had low sugar concentrations, the lowest viscosity and sugar:amino acid ratio, was rich in essential amino acids, and appeared ideally suited to the digestive physiology of T. albipes. This preference for young leaf EFN may explain the greater protection afforded to young leaves than to floral buds by T. albipes, and may also help to resolve ant-pollinator conflicts. The differential response of dominant ants to sugar, amino acids, or solution viscosity suggests that plants can fine-tune their interactions with local ants via EFN composition. Thus, EFN can mediate local partner-choice mechanisms in ant-plant interactions.",

To clarify the associations of these bugs with the plants & the ants, we studied the food habits of 3 bug species, Pilophorus lambirensis Nakatani et Komatsu, 2013 (Hemiptera: Miridae: Phylinae), Phylinae sp.1, & Arbela sp.1 (Hemiptera: Nabidae).  We conducted field observations in a Bornean rainforest.  First, we located these bugs & studied their behavioral responses to the ants on Macaranga species & then conducted stable isotope analyses.  All bugs avoided direct contact with ants, but they occurred only on trees with active ants. Pilophorus lambirensis & Phylinae sp.1 were most commonly observed on the apical parts of host trees, whereas Arbela sp.1 was mainly in areas distant from the apical parts, where ants were sparse. The stable isotope ratios indicated that Phylinae sp. 1 fed on food bodies, which are nutrient-rich spherical bodies produced by Macaranga trees on the apical parts for ants.  Although the main diet of the other 2 species remains unclear, nitrogen isotopic signatures demonstrated that P. lambirensis is herbivorous, whereas Arbela sp.1 is carnivorous.  However, the distant location from ants & its isotopic signatures indicated that Arbela sp.1 rarely fed on the ants.  At least 2 mirid bug species might obtain enemy-free space in addition to the food provided by the myrmecophytes.]",

    "abstract": "Grasslands and savannas are dynamic ecosystems, strongly regulated by environmental disturbances such as fire. Maintaining disturbance regimes in these ecosystems are of great conservation concern, and require studies with the use of ecological indicators. Biotic interactions are a major component of biodiversity that are particularly sensitive to environmental changes, and therefore should be considered in ecosystem assessment and monitoring. One of the most common interactions between insects and plants is mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), where ants use food resources from plants in exchange for protection against herbivores. Here, we explored variations on this ant-plant interaction across a post-fire successional gradient (i.e., few months to more than two years since the last fire) in eleven grassland patches in South Brazil. We evaluated time-since-fire effects on (i) the grassland habitat structure, (ii) an EFN-bearing plant population: Chamaecrista repens, (iii) the EFN-visiting ant communities, and (iv) the ant-plant ecological networks. We expected fire-induced habitat changes to benefit this plant population, and to produce positive cascading effects on interacting ants, thus influencing the structure of ant-plant networks. Freshly-burnt sites presented increased C. repens abundance, and larger individuals with more reproductive structures and EFNs in comparison with sites longer without disturbances. Plant abundance and size were inversely related to the cover of dominant grasses along the habitat gradient. The density of EFN-visiting ants, but not their species richness, increased in freshly-burnt sites, stimulated by the greater resource offer and the habitat openness, which probably facilitated ant activity. Moreover, with increasing time-since-fire, ants interacted with fewer plants, and few species formed the network generalist core. These results could further suggest that the defense service against herbivory provided by ants is also diminished in grasslands longer without disturbances. Overall, by using a series of indicators of habitat change from multiple ecological levels, this study highlights the importance of disturbance for grassland biodiversity and their ecological interactions, helping to improve management decisions.",

However, secretory structures at this same position in some representatives of the genus have been misidentified as EFNs, since they release exudates other than nectar. In view of the inconsistencies in the classification of EFNs in Passiflora as well as in other botanical groups, we aimed to determine whether the foliar glands in Amazonian Passiflora acuminata DC., P. glandulosa Cav., P. nitida Kunth, P. tholozanii Sacco, and P. vespertilio L., are EFNs and to investigate the plant-insect interactions in these species by performing a survey of their visitors. Glands were evaluated by means of standard protocols in light and scanning electron microscopies. Additionally, glucostrips were applied over the profuse secretion to the presence of glucose. The glucostrip test showed positive results in all species, which enabled the classification of all glands as EFNs. Ants collecting nectar and patrolling the leaf surface belong to Ectatomma, Crematogaster, and Camponotus. Petiolar EFNs are present in P. acuminata, P. glandulosa, P. nitida, and P. tholozanii. Laminar EFNs usually described as ocelli are present only in P. vespertilio and P. glandulosa. Regardless of the morphology, the EFNs have a multiple or biseriate epidermis, a nectariferous parenchyma consisting of voluminous, thin-walled cells whose vacuoles contain dense contents, plus the occurrence of druse and a predominantly phloematic vascularization. The structure of the nectaries is consistent within Passiflora; other characteristics such as the presence of sugar in the secretion, the visitation by ants and butterflies, indicate the importance of the ecological interactions between EFNs and their visitors.",

    "abstract": "Bromeliads provide habitat and food resources for various organisms. Besides the nectar and pollen, the leaf and fruit tissues of these plants supply food for various animal groups. Among the groups that feed on bromeliads, herbivores are the ones that cause the most damage to these plants; among such organisms, some are well known, such as butterfly and moth caterpillars. Here we will describe some of the ecological relationships between the butterflies Strymon serapio and moths Castnia invaria in association with the rupicolous habitat-forming bromeliad Encholirium spectabile. In rocky outcrops of the Brazilian Semiarid Caatinga, S. serapio caterpillars were frequently observed in the blooms of E. spectabile and adults in the leaves, as well as adults of C. invaria. However, in C. invaria the larvae develop inside the bromeliads. Adults of both species were associated with E. spectabile throughout the year in the study area. We observed S. serapio eggs and larvae mainly during the beginning of the dry season, and the eggs of C. invaria, occur mainly during the rainy season. Regarding the daily activity period, the two species show diurnal habits. Caterpillars of S. serapio develop mutualistic relations with ants of the genus Crematogaster in the blooms of E. spectabile. This is the first record for this kind of ant-butterfly interactions taking place in Encholirum bromeliads, although they have already been cited for other species of Bromeliaceae. The record of these interactions in E. spectabile suggests that these bromeliads are relevant for local biodiversity, also regarding interactions with species of commercial interest, which use the E. spectabile as a host plant.          *[This record consists of a complex relationship between E. spectabile, Crematogaster sp. ants, & S. serapio caterpillars.  Ants build their nests on the leaves of bromeliads, use flowers as a place of foraging & defend the caterpillar in exchange for food rewards released by them, whereas butterflies lay their eggs on flowers & the larvae that hatch feed on the floral tissues of the bromeliad & get protection from ants against invading eventual predators.]",

The secretory glochids were soft, massive, and barbed, as well as translucent. Hyaline droplets on the secretory glochid apex were collected by aggressive ants. The secretory glochids originated from the areolar meristem, beginning as small protuberances formed by protoderm and ground meristem. Mature secretory glochids consisted of a central multiseriate axis of ground cells covered by uniseriate epidermis with a continuous cuticle, and exhibited three regions: (i) dilated vascularized base with parenchyma cells exhibiting features associated to nectar secretion; (ii) elongated median region with juxtaposed fusiform non-lignified parenchyma cells; and (iii) tapered apical portion with immature fibers loosely arranged cells. The exudate was sucrose-dominant with a similar amino acid profile in both species.

    "abstract": "Plant invasions are known to have negative impacts on native plant communities, yet their influence on higher trophic levels has not been well documented. Past studies investigating the effects of invasive plants on herbivores and carnivores have been largely observational in nature and thus lack the ability to tease apart whether differences are a cause or consequence of the invasion. In addition, understanding how plant traits and plant species compositions change in invaded habitats may increase our ability to predict when and where invasive plants will have effects that cascade to animals. To assess effects on arthropods, we experimentally introduced a non-native plant (Microstegium vimineum, Japanese stiltgrass) in a community re-assembly experiment. We also investigated possible mechanisms through which the invader could affect associated arthropods, including changes in native plant species richness, above-ground plant biomass, light availability and vegetation height. In experimentally invaded plots, arthropod abundance was reduced by 39%, and species richness declined by 19%. Carnivores experienced greater reductions in abundance than herbivores (61% vs 31% reduction). Arthropod composition significantly diverged between experimentally invaded and control plots, and particular species belonging to the abundant families Aphididae (aphids), Formicidae (ants) and Phalacridae (shining flower beetles) contributed the most to compositional differences. Among the mechanisms we investigated, only the reduction in native plant species richness caused by invasion was strongly correlated with total arthropod abundance and richness. In sum, our results demonstrate negative impacts of M. vimineum invasion on higher trophic levels and suggest that these effects occur, in part, indirectly through invader-mediated reductions in the richness of the native plant community. The particularly strong response of carnivores suggests that plant invasion could reduce top-down control of herbivorous species for native plants.",

The objective of this work was to study the effect of the mutualism between the ants & the plant on the antagonism between the butterfly larvae & the plant.  The general hypothesis tested was that ants protect the plant from the attack of the larvae \"in exchange\" for the nectar they receive.  An ant exclusion experiment was conducted to explore whether their presence affects the presence of eggs & larvae, & the damage they produce.  This experiment was carried out at Parque Natural Municipal Ribera Norte (PNMRN), located in the San Isidro district, in Buenos Aires province, between September 2011 & March 2012.  Five different ant morphospecies were recorded on P. caerulea.  There was a negative effect of the ants on the number of eggs & larvae of A. vanillae.  However, the presence of ants did not affect the level of herbivory damage observed.  In other words, the protection mutualism had a negative effect on the herbivore attacked (butterfly), but did not seem to have the expected positive effect on the defended plant (Passiflora).

Removal of pearl bodies from the plants increased their production; however, plant growth and chlorophyll content were negatively associated with pearl body replenishment. Potentially to mitigate this resource cost, plants developed such a novel defense response because we found that aphid presence reduced pearl body production, but only when there were no ants.

Here, we evaluate the effect of chronic anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., firewood collection, livestock grazing) and vegetation seasonality on foraging area, foliage availability in the foraging area, leaf consumption and herbivory rate of the leaf\u0010cutting ant Atta opaciceps in the semiarid Caatinga, a mosaic of dry forest and scrub vegetation in northeast Brazil. Contrary to our initial expectation, the foraging area was not affected by either disturbance intensity or the interaction between season and disturbance intensity. However, leaf consumption and herbivory rate were higher in more disturbed areas. We also found a strong effect of seasonality, with higher leaf consumption and herbivory rate in the dry season. Our results suggest that the foraging ecology of leaf\u0010cutting ants is modulated by human disturbance and seasonality as these two drivers affect the spectrum and the amount of resources available for these ants in the Caatinga. Despite the low productivity of Caatinga vegetation, the annual rates of biomass consumption by A. opaciceps are similar to those reported from other leaf\u0010cutting ants in rain forests and savannas. This is made possible by maintaining high foraging activity even in the peak of the dry season and taking benefit from any resource available, including low\u0010quality items. Such compensation highlights the adaptive capacity of LCA to persist or even proliferate in human\u0010modified landscapes from dry to rain forests.",

Global insect decline requires restoration of the plant-insect mutualistic interactions. By using magnet plants, it is possible to supply beneficial insects with better resource availability and create more sustainable habitats. Current management practices recommend using Umbellifers (Apiales, Apiaceae) in restoration projects. However, analyses of the structure and dynamics of entomofauna associated with this plant family is needed to facilitate practical actions. Here the attention is focused on species composition and seasonal dynamics of beneficial insects associated with sweet fennel Foeniculum vulgare (Apiaceae, Umbelliferae) in Crimea. A 2-year sampling campaign identified 60 insect species from 40 genera across 20 families and four orders: Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Neuroptera. These insects represented the groups such as social wasps, bees, ants, bumble bees, potter wasps, beetles, lacewings, mud daubers, tachinid flies, and hoverflies. Social wasps and hoverflies dominated in sample collections. Most of insects collected benefit ecosystems and provide essential ecosystem services. During fennel\u0019s flowering season, the number of visits by bumble bees, beetles, bees. and wasps decreased. Contrastingly, dipterans visitation increased towards the end of the season. Such trends might be explained with fennel's functional protandry, bias in nectar production between male and female flower stages, and insects' feeding preferences. F. vulgare attracts a diverse assemblage of beneficial insects and consequently can be recommended as a magnet species. When aiming to attract specific insect groups, the seasonal dynamics of fennel\u0019s associated entomofauna should be considered.",

We studied patterns of seed dispersal by ants and seed predation by rodents of these two herbs at three spatial scales: (1) among three woodlots that differed in density and size of Hepatica and/or Trillium populations, (2) between two sites within each woodlot located inside and outside a natural population, and (3) between replicate quadrats within each site. We estimated ant numbers and rodent presence using baits. In contrast to other studies done on other ant-dispersed species, seed predation by rodents was rare or nonexistent for both species even though rodents were present at all sites. Seed removal rates by ants were quite patchy at the scale of a few square metres within sites, but generally were slower where seed populations were dense and extensive. This indicates that ants become satiated during and immediately after seeds are released from parent plants growing in dense populations. Hence, seed dispersal is often ant-limited within well established populations of myrmecochores. Edaphic-topographic factors also play an important indirect role in seed dispersal through their effect on local ant numbers. The evolutionary role of seed predation on myrmecochory, and the demographic implications of density-dependent seed dispersal are discussed.",

We concluded that mycorrhizal root mats were unique to particular plant communities (sagebrush steppe) and were not a common feature of P. occidentalis' nests across its distributional range.",

    "abstract": "Tropical tree-climbing lianas form paths that benefit foraging of dominant ants which might protect the host tree against herbivores. In contrast, lianas are often associated with negative effects on growth and reproduction of host trees due to light obstruction, structural stress and other negative effects. It is unclear if dominant ants could mitigate the negative effects of lianas on host plants. We investigated how lianas and carton nest ants (Azteca chartifex) affected herbivory and reproductive structures of the host tree Byrsonima sericea. Considering 68 trees, almost half of them were naturally colonized by A. chartifex nests (32 trees). We removed lianas from half of the trees (34), establishing a factorial sampling design between A. chartifex and liana presence. We sampled ants and leaf herbivory before and after removing lianas, and measured plant fitness in two consecutive years after removing lianas. Liana removal had no effect on A. chartifex foraging, on leaf herbivory and flower-fruit conversion of host plants. However, A. chartifex decreased leaf herbivory and increased B. sericea flower-fruit conversion irrespective of lianas presence. A noticeable positive effect of ants was detected only in the second year of the experiment, consistently on all plants at each experimental level. The reproductive conditions of the first year resulted in most plants with more than 75% flower-to-fruit conversion success, regardless of the presence of A. chartifex, a success sustained only on those ant-colonized plants in the second year. Our results contribute to understanding multi-trophic interactions in tropical forest canopies as we demonstrated i) that dominant arboreal ants can benefit plants even in a non-obligatory interaction and ii) that the influence of lianas on its host tree is context-dependent, presenting even neutral effects depending on habitat type and species involved.",

    "abstract": "In their association with myrmecophytes (i.e. plants that shelter a limited number of ant species in hollow structures), ants sometimes provide only poor biotic protection for their host plants, but may supply them with nutrients (myrmecotrophy). We studied three geophytic myrmecophytes growing in the understorey of Guianian rain forests. Allomerus ants build spongy-looking galleries rich in detritus and insect debris over the stems of their host plants [Cordia nodosa Lamark (Boraginaceae) and Hirtella physophora Martius & Zuccharini (Chrysobalanaceae)], while Pheidole minutula Mayr colonies deposit their waste in the leaf pouches of their host plant [Maieta guianensis Aublet (Melastomataceae)]. This waste is more nitrogen-rich than that found in the Allomerus galleries, themselves containing more nitrogen than the plant leaves. Using stable isotope analysis we noted a significant difference in \u00a515 N between ant-occupied and unoccupied plants only for Maieta, for which 80% of the host plant nitrogen is derived from Pheidole waste. Experiments on all three plants using a15N-supplemented solution of NH4Cl confirmed these results, with an increase in this isotope noted between control and experimental plants only for Maieta. The internal surfaces of Maieta leaf pouches bear protuberances whose likely role is to absorb nutrients from the Pheidole waste. The alternative hypothesis, that these protuberances play a role in provisioning ants, was rejected after comparing their structure with those of extrafloral nectaries and food bodies in a histological study.",

We tested to see whether the activity of the colonies of the two species directly altered the microhabitat characteristics of the nesting sites. Microhabitat characteristics were assessed quantifying several abiotic factors (light, temperature, soil moisture, soil pH, nitrogen) by means of the Ellenberg Bioindication Model. The model represents a simple way of interpreting the vegetation pattern in terms of ecological factors from the perspective of the plants and can be considered an effective and promising approach to link animal and plant ecology. Our data showed significant differences in the nesting site microhabitat characteristics partially due to a different capacity of the two species to alter nesting site proprieties. Possible differences in the physiological tolerance of these species to moisture gradients could be crucial in determining the distribution and abundance of their nests.",

Despite the diversity of cavities in which ants can nest, there are only four published records of colonies inside fruits still attached to trees. Here, we report the occurrence of ant colonies inside mature fruits of Stryphnodendron adstringens, which to our knowledge comprises the first formal record of fruit nests at the Brazilian Cerrado, a Neotropical savanna.

The abundance and richness of floral visitors were positively related to the quantity of plant species and flowering, as well as rainfall. Herbaceous and woody strata are important for the maintenance of anthophilous fauna throughout the year. Plant species with the highest abundance and the longest flowering period presented the highest richness and/or abundance of floral visitors. The percentage of pollination was higher than that of resource theft. Bees and flies were the main groups of pollinators, whereas flies were the main thieves.

    "abstract": "The threat addressed to tropical biomes such as the Brazilian Cerrado leads to an urgent need for understanding the natural history of plant-insect interactions within ecosystems. Byrsonima verbascifolia is an evident Cerrado plant found to be economically and culturally important. This plant species is commonly found in that biome, showing a close association with insects since their flower buds and inflorescences contain attractive oil glands for a wide variety of them. In this study, we investigated whether communities of flower-visiting insects and ants associated with B. verbascifolia in the flower bud phase differ from those in the flowering phase. The abundance, richness and diversity of insect visitors to flower buds were similar in relation to inflorescences. However, low similarity of the composition of bud/inflorescence-visiting insects was observed. On the other hand, ants associated with plants in the anthesis phase showed a significantly higher abundance in relation to plants with flower buds, although the diversity was similar in both phases. Ant richness was higher in plants containing greater proportions of open inflorescences than buds, although this difference was only marginally significant. The ant community similarity in plants with buds and inflorescences was higher. Results suggest that different available resources (oil, pollen and petals) in buds and inflorescences of B. verbascifolia recruit a community of insect visitors with distinct composition, which was less affected in relation to the ant community. These findings show that visitors and ants do not use the same flower resource, once there are differences in terms of resources available in both flower buds and inflorescence stages.",

    "abstract": "Sour cherries (Prunus cerasus) and domestic plums (Prunus domestica) are fruit crops of commercial interest worldwide. As most of Prunus are early blooming plants, there is a problem to provide an effective pollination for qualitative fruit setting. During the last decade, low fruit setting in sour cherries and domestic plums was observed in Latvia. Fruit setting can be influenced by different factors, including the quality of pollination provided by pollinating insects. To understand the current situation with pollinator availability in cherry and plum orchards, observations have been made on anthophilous insect diversity from 2013 to 2015. Results demonstrate that flowers of sour cherries and domestic plums attract insects from three main taxonomic groups - Coleoptera (31.9%), Diptera (37.8%), and Hymenoptera (30.4%). Observations showed that traditional pollinators, bees and bumblebees, visited flowers in low numbers. Flowers of sour cherries showed higher attraction to bees than those of domestic plums did. It was observed that native bumblebees were not attracted by flowers of both crops, but buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) from artificial colonies quite actively visited flowers of sour cherries. The flowers of both crops attracted quite a large number of Meligethes spp. beetles, small flies, and two species of ants (Formica fusca and Lasius niger). Seven-spot ladybirds (Coccinella septempunctata) were recognised as alternative effective pollen carriers.",

    "abstract": "Three recent meta\u0010analyses of protective plant-ant mutualisms report a surprisingly weak relationship between herbivore protection and measured demographic benefits to ant\u0010plants, suggesting high tolerance for herbivory, substantial costs of ant\u0010mediated defense, and/or benefits that are realized episodically rather than continuously. Experimental manipulations of protective ant-plant associations typically last for less than a year, yet virtually all specialized myrmecophytes are long\u0010lived perennials for which the costs and benefits of maintaining ant symbionts could accrue at different rates over the host's lifetime. To complement long\u0010term monitoring studies, we experimentally excluded each of four ant symbionts from their long\u0010lived myrmecophyte host trees (Acacia drepanolobium) for 4.5 years. Ant species varied in their effectiveness against herbivores and in their effects on intermediate\u0010term growth and reproduction, but the level of herbivore protection provided was a poor predictor of the net impact they had on host trees. Removal of the three Crematogaster species resulted in cumulative gains in host tree growth and/or reproduction over the course of the experiment, despite the fact that two of those species significantly reduce chronic herbivore damage. In contrast, although T. penzigi is a relatively poor defender, the low cost of maintaining this ant symbiont apparently eliminated negative impacts on overall tree growth and reproduction, resulting in enhanced allocation to new branch growth by the final census. Acacia drepanolobium is evidently highly tolerant of herbivory by insects and small browsers, and the costs of maintaining Crematogaster colonies exceeded the benefits received during the study. No experimental trees were killed by elephants, but elephant damage was uniquely associated with reduced tree growth, and at least one ant species (C. mimosae) strongly deterred elephant browsing. We hypothesize that rare but catastrophic damage by elephants may be more important than chronic herbivory in maintaining the costly myrmecophyte habit in this system.",

    "abstract": "In systems where disturbance creates colonization opportunities, competition\u0013colonization trade\u0010offs can lead to coexistence between competitors sharing a single, limiting resource. In upland East Africa, four species of obligate acacia\u0010ants compete for possession of Acacia drepanolobium host trees but still coexist at fine spatial scales. Previous experiments revealed a hierarchy of competitive dominance among mature ant colonies in battles over occupied trees (Crematogaster sjostedti > C. mimosae > C. nigriceps > Tetraponera penzigi), and the pattern of ant species turnover on single host trees over time is consistent with this hierarchy. Here we present evidence that competition\u0013colonization trade\u0010offs are likely to facilitate coexistence within this guild. The population of host trees is highly dynamic. Although most suitable host trees are occupied by ants, mature A. drepanolobium trees may be vacated after fire, extensive damage, or drought. Smaller host trees with limited nesting space become available when they recruit into the population as saplings or coppices. These unoccupied trees may be colonized by expansion of nearby, mature colonies as well as by foundress queens attempting to initiate new colonies. We identified competition\u0013colonization trade\u0010offs between two stages of colony development: competitive colony expansion onto nearby trees, and competition among foundress queens for nest\u0010initiation sites. All three Crematogaster species readily occupy nearby, empty trees by colony expansion. In contrast, T. penzigi colonizes empty trees almost exclusively by dispersive foundress queens. Colonies of C. sjostedti are competitively dominant over those of all other species, but foundress queens of this species rarely attempt to start independent colonies. Foundress queens of the secondary competitive dominant (C. mimosae) are restricted mostly to low\u0010quality, small saplings. In contrast, competitively subordinate colonies of T. penzigi and C. nigriceps produce foundress queens that disproportionately colonize empty mature trees, the highest quality host plants that are available. Competition between foundress queens is intense. Queens are significantly hyper\u0010dispersed among potential nest\u0010initiation sites, indicating that the presence of resident foundresses deters subsequent colonization attempts, and competitive dominance among foundresses who fight during colony founding is the reverse of that seen among mature colonies. Coexistence within this guild may therefore be promoted by ontogenetic reversals in relative competitive ability between early and late stages of colony development, a pattern that is consistent with the niche hypothesis for competition\u0013colonization trade\u0010offs.",

    "abstract": "Losses of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning due to rainforest destruction and agricultural intensification are prime concerns for science and society alike. Potentially, ecosystems show nonlinear responses to land-use intensification that would open management options with limited ecological losses but satisfying economic gains. However, multidisciplinary studies to quantify ecological losses and socioeconomic tradeoffs under different management options are rare. Here, we evaluate opposing land use strategies in cacao agroforestry in Sulawesi, Indonesia, by using data on species richness of nine plant and animal taxa, six related ecosystem functions, and on socioeconomic drivers of agroforestry expansion. Expansion of cacao cultivation by 230% in the last two decades was triggered not only by economic market mechanisms, but also by rarely considered cultural factors. Transformation from near-primary forest to agroforestry had little effect on overall species richness, but reduced plant biomass and carbon storage by [almost equal to]75% and species richness of forest-using species by [almost equal to]60%. In contrast, increased land use intensity in cacao agroforestry, coupled with a reduction in shade tree cover from 80% to 40%, caused only minor quantitative changes in biodiversity and maintained high levels of ecosystem functioning while doubling farmers\u0019 net income. However, unshaded systems further increased income by [almost equal to]40%, implying that current economic incentives and cultural preferences for new intensification practices put shaded systems at risk. We conclude that low-shade agroforestry provides the best available compromise between economic forces and ecological needs. Certification schemes for shade-grown crops may provide a market-based mechanism to slow down current intensification trends.          *[At each site, we surveyed species richness of trees, herbs, epiphytic understory bryophytes, lower-canopy beetles, lower-canopy ants, leaf-litter ants, trap-nesting bees & wasps, & their antagonists.  Species richness of herbs, bees, wasps, & their antagonists peaked at intermediate levels of canopy cover, whereas bryophytes, canopy beetles, & ants showed no significant correlation with canopy cover.  However, when we analyzed the distribution of the subset of species that also occurred in near-primary forest, we found that only a small fraction of forest-based herbs, bryophytes, & beetles also colonized agroforestry systems; loss of forest-using ants was relatively low; & the few species of bees, wasps, & their antagonists found in the forest sites also occurred in agroforestry sites.]",

    "abstract": "Invasive ants threaten native communities, in part, through their potential to disrupt mutualisms, yet invasive species may also facilitate native species. The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is one of the most conspicuous invasive ants in North America and its high densities, combined with its potential to displace native ants, have led to concerns that it may disrupt ant-plant seed dispersal mutualisms. We examined the potential of fire ants to disperse seeds in the longleaf pine ecosystem by comparing the removal of elaiosome-bearing seeds by fire ants versus native ants.  A total of 14 ant species were observed removing seeds, with fire ants responsible for more than half of all removals. While fire ants were the dominant seed remover in this system, they did not remove significantly more seeds than would be expected based on their population density (46% of ground-dwelling ants). Moreover, red imported fire ants were similar to native ants with respect to distance of seed movement and frequency of moving seeds back to the nest. Areas of higher fire ant densities were found to have greater rates of seed removal by ants without a subsequent drop in seed dispersal by native ants, suggesting that fire ant-invaded areas may experience overall higher levels of seed dispersal. Thus, fire ants may actually facilitate dispersal of elaiosome-bearing plant species in the longleaf pine ecosystem.",

Here we examine the impact of insectivorous birds, bats, and ants exclusion on arthropods communities on replicated 5\t\u25ca\t5\tm of pioneering early successional vegetation plots in lowland tropical forest gaps in Papua New Guinea. In plots from which focal taxa of predators were excluded we observed increased biomass of herbivorous and predatory arthropods, and increased density, and decreased diversity of herbivorous insects. However, changes in the biomass of plants, herbivores, and arthropod predators were positively correlated or uncorrelated between these three trophic levels and also between individual arthropod orders. Arthropod abundance and biomass correlated strongly with the plant biomass irrespective of the arthropods' trophic position, a signal of bottom\u0010up control. Patterns in herbivore specialization confirm lack of a strong top\u0010down control and were largely unaffected by the exclusion of insectivorous birds, bats, and ants. No changes of plant\u0013herbivore interaction networks were detected except for decrease in modularity of the exclosure plots. Our results suggest weak top\u0010down control of herbivores, limited compensation between arthropod and vertebrate predators, and limited intra\u0010guild predation by birds, bats, and ants. Possible explanations are strong bottom\u0010up control, a low activity of the higher order predators, especially birds, possibly also bats, in gaps, and continuous influx of herbivores from surrounding mature forest matrix.",

To test this theory in a natural landscape, we construct a spatially explicit model of the symbiosis between the ant-plant Cordia nodosa and its two, protecting ant symbionts, Allomerus and Azteca. Allomerus is also a castration parasite, preventing fruiting to increase colony fecundity. Limiting the dispersal of Allomerus and host plant selects for intermediate castration virulence. Increasing the frequency of the mutualist, Azteca, selects for higher castration virulence in Allomerus, because seeds from Azteca-inhabited plants are a public good that Allomerus exploits. These results are consistent with field observations and, to our knowledge, provide the first empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that spatial structure can reduce castration virulence and the first such evidence in a natural landscape for either mortality or castration virulence.",

The obligate myrmecochorous, large-seed bearing Viola hondoensis & ant-ballistic diplochorous, small-seed bearing Viola spp. & Corydalis pallida were studied.  1) Ant preference: attraction rate & transportation rate of large V. hondoensis seeds by ants were consistently high regardless of the disperser ant size, while those rates of small diplochorous seeds were conspicuously lower for large Aphaenogaster ants than for small Pheidole ants, suggesting small seeds are not adapted to be carried by large ants.  2) Dispersal distance: large V. hondoensis seeds were transported for a long distance, because they were carried by both large & small ants, while the small diplochorous seeds were transported for a short distance because they were carried only by small ants.  These results suggest that large seeds are advantageous to attract large ants & to be farther dispersed as far as ant-mediated dispersal is concerned.  On the other hand, the diplochorous small seeds do not attract large ants, & so are transported short distances by ants, although they disperse their seeds by ballistic dispersal.]",

The focal species of this study, Aechmea aquilega, sheltered the colonies of 12 ant species in a Guianese rural habitat where Odontomachus haematodus, associated with 60% of these plants, was the most frequent. Unexpectedly, the ant species richness was higher in a compared urban habitat with 21 species, but two synanthropic and four invasive ants were noted among them. Consequently, we conducted baiting surveys (on the ground, on trees and on trees bearing A. aquilega) as well as complementary surveys using different sampling modes in urban areas to test if A. aquilega is a surrogate revealing the presence of certain invasive ants. During the baiting survey, we recorded four Neotropical and eight introduced invasive ants out of a total of 69 species. Of these 12 invasive species, five were noted by baiting A. aquilega (including two only noted in this way). A bootstrap simulation permitted us to conclude that A. aquilega significantly concentrates certain species of invasive ants. This was confirmed by complementary surveys, where we did not record further species. We conclude that baiting on trees bearing large epiphytes in human-modified, Neotropical areas is a relevant complement to the early detection of invasive ants.",

Yet despite an abundant literature documenting thermal constraints on ant activity and behavior, we know little about whether temperature variation can influence the benefits conferred by ants to plants. We evaluated the effects of dawn\u0010to\u0010dusk fluctuations in temperature on patrolling and aggressive behavior in four arboreal ant mutualists of Acacia drepanolobium trees in central Kenya. We found that ant aggressive behavior significantly increased with branch surface temperature, primarily in the two most aggressive ant species: Crematogaster mimosae and C. nigriceps workers attacked a simulated herbivore at higher rates as surface temperature rose. In a browsing experiment, we found that goats browsed more frequently and for longer durations on C. mimosae\u0010defended trees during cooler times of day, while goat browsing on plants from which ants had been removed was not affected by temperature. Our study demonstrates temperature\u0010dependence in the efficacy of ant defense against herbivory and suggests that these ant\u0010plants may be more vulnerable to herbivory during cooler hours of the day, when many native browsers are most active.",

Yet, the selective factors underlying the diversity in dispersal syndromes are largely unknown. The differential requirements for seed dispersal distances are often proposed as a main factor in plant adaptations to disperser animals. Focusing on two sympatric ant-dispersed sedges Carex lanceolata and Carex tristachya (Cyperaceae), we tested the association of the adaptation to different dispersers with requirements for seed dispersal distances. We found that C. lanceolata was more frequently dispersed by the large ant Formica japonica (which had relatively long dispersal distances compared with other smaller ants) than by C. tristachya, and this was caused by the higher seed attractiveness of C. lanceolata to F. japonica. Pot experiments manipulating adult-to-seedling distances showed that isolation from conspecific adults only benefited C. lanceolata seedlings, and C. tristachya seedlings were not affected. These results support the importance of differential requirements for seed dispersal distances as a factor underlying the diversity in dispersal syndromes among animal-dispersed plants.",

Previous theory predicts that parasites should evolve maximum virulence, yet hosts are often incompletely sterilized. Whereas prior attempts to resolve this paradox have sought evolutionary explanations, we present theory and experiments showing that incomplete sterilization can arise from ecologically driven fluctuations in parasite load. The African ant-plant Acacia drepanolobium reproduced more when occupied by small colonies of the sterilizing symbiont Crematogaster nigriceps. In nature, small colonies result from interference competition between ant colonies; these territorial conflicts thus provide intermittent windows of opportunity for host reproduction. Our mean-field model shows that numerical insufficiency of parasites can produce partial sterilization of host populations, creating the appearance of reduced virulence even if ants have evolved to sterilize completely. This general framework helps explain both the apparent ubiquity of partial sterilization parasitism and the ability of these symbiotic associations to persist.",

Hollow, ant-occupied stems were previously known only in four species of southern Central American Piper, all members of Section Macrostachys. Here we present two additional, unrelated, hollow-stemmed myrmecophytes from Ecuador: P. immutatum and P. pterocladum (members of sections Radula and Peltobryon, respectively). Although similar superficially, stem cavities of the Ecuadorian Piper species differ morphologically and developmentally from those of Central American taxa. The stem cavities of P. immutatum, and possibly P. pterocladum, are formed during stem development, and begin forming only a few millimeters behind the apical meristem. This mode of cavity formation differs markedly from myrmecophytes in section Macrostachys, where the stems remain solid unless excavated by the specialized ant partner Pheidole bicornis. The stems of P. immutatum and P. pterocladum do not produce wound-response tissue around the cavity, unlike the stems in section Macrostachys. The entrance holes in stems of P. immutatum are formed through apoptotic processes and are located at each node below the petiole, whereas those in section Macrostachys are excavated by the ants in the leaf axil. This study documents convergent evolution of ant-plant associations in Piper, and emphasizes the need for careful comparison of apparently homologous, ant-associated structures in specialized myrmecophytes.",

Macrostachys have obligate associations with ants, in which the ant partner derives food and shelter from modified plant structures and, in turn, protects the plant against fungal infection and herbivory. In addition to these obligate ant-plants (i.e. myrmecophytes), several other species in Piper have resident ants only sometimes (facultative), and still other plant species never have resident ants. Sheathing petioles of sect. Macrostachys form the domatia in which ants nest.  Myrmecophytes in sect. Macrostachys have tightly closed petiole sheaths with bases that clasp the stem. These sheathing petioles appear to be the single most important plant character in the association between ants and species of sect. Macrostachys.

    "abstract": "Insectivorous plants and ant-fed plants represent the two ways in which plants have evolved to utilize directly nutrients derived from animals. This paper addresses the limitations under which selection acts to favour the evolution of one or the other of these nutrient-gathering tactics. Both tactics have evolved independently at least six times under similar ecological conditions, indicating that the evolutionary solutions to ecological problems are limited by the historical make-up of communities and are, to some extent, predictable. Both insectivorous and ant-fed plants evolve in environments with very low levels of availability of nutrients in the substrate; the primary use of the animal-food is probably nitrogen; the vast majority of species are perennial, and most species are tropical or subtropical, although some insectivorous genera are primarily temperate. Although these two nutrient-gathering tactics evolve in response to similar ecological problems, whether plants evolve an insectivorous habit or the ant-fed habit depends on the growth forms of the plants and the habitats in which they grow. Most insectivorous plants evolve as herbs in wet, sterile soils or in sterile aquatic habitats; ant-fed plants evolve as epiphytes on trees in open-canopied habitats. These kinds of animal-plant interactions are relatively rare because the environments in which they are favoured by selection are uncommon.",

    "abstract": "1. Beneficial 'services' in mutualistic interactions have often not evolved de novo, but from ancestral traits that had a function before the emergence of the association. These traits can then acquire novel functions in a mutualism. Even in many close insect-plant relationships, the services provided by each partner are still unclear.  2. In the well-known association between the carnivorous pitcher plant, Nepenthes bicalcarata, and Camponotus schmitzi ants in Borneo, the ants benefit by receiving food and nesting space in swollen, hollow pitcher tendrils, but the benefits to the plant are less clear. Previous studies have suggested that the ants protect against herbivory, prevent putrefaction of pitchers by removing prey items from them or increase the pitcher's prey retention rate by attacking pitcher visitors.  3. Field observations showed that C. schmitzi ants regularly clean the pitcher rim (peristome), which is the main surface responsible for prey capture. We found that this behaviour increases the carnivorous plant's prey capture efficiency and helps to maintain it over the pitcher's life span. Running tests with Oecophylla smaragdina ants on colonised and ant-free older pitchers demonstrated 45.8% higher capture efficiency in pitchers inhabited by C. schmitzi. Head counts of trapped ants showed that C. schmitzi-colonised pitchers indeed captured significantly (45.2%) more prey than uncolonised pitchers of the same age.  4. The peristomes of ant-free older pitchers were strongly contaminated by fungal hyphae and other particles. Experimental contamination of clean pitcher peristomes with starch also strongly reduced capture efficiency. While the peristome was cleaned rapidly in ant-colonised pitchers and capture efficiency returned to the previous level within approximately 1 week, no cleaning and recovery were observed in ant-free pitchers.  5. Within the genus Nepenthes, N. bicalcarata has exceptionally long-lived pitchers. We propose that C. schmitzi ants benefit N. bicalcarata by keeping the pitchers effective over long periods of time, likely allowing the plant to acquire more nutrients per pitcher and thereby minimise pitcher construction costs.  6. Our findings demonstrate that the cleaning behaviour typical of many plant-ants has acquired a novel function in this ant-plant association, giving rise to a new type of myrmecotrophic mutualism.",

Pest reduction was seen on cacao (Theobroma cacao), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), and mango (Mangifera indica) trees. The single exception to these pest reductions occurred when ants facilitated the population growth of mealybugs and other honeydew producers. In general, we found that Oecophylla ants provided the valuable ecosystem service of natural pest control to a diversity of tropical tree crops. Despite the potential for the ants to harm other predators or pollinators, evidence for these ecosystem disservices was rare and other beneficial insects co-exist well with this group of ants. Our findings bolster the general finding that ant species that tend herbivores who are not themselves pests can provide broad-reaching benefits to plant productivity.]",

Among trees, aggressive ants limited each other's numbers.  Within trees, habitat partitioning was based on host plant specificity.  Cordia specialists (ants that only nest in C. alliodora) nested in the upper branches of the plant, while generalists (ants that nest in other plant species, as well as C. alliodora), did not nest in the upper branches of the plant.  Cordia alliodora is inhabited by multiple different ant species simultaneously.  I used behavioral experiments to assess the relative costs & benefits of each ant species to the host plant.  I also analyzed the diet of each ant species using stable isotope analysis.  Together, these studies indicated that the nature of the relationship between the host plant & the ants varied depending on the identity of the ant inhabitant.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of excluding pollinators and/or ants on the per-plant reproductive success in two species (Dyckia floribunda Griseb. and Dyckia longipetala Baker, Bromeliaceae) that produce floral and extrafloral nectar. The hypothesis states that both ecological processes (pollination and ant defense) involving nectar-mediated animal-plant interactions are beneficial for plant reproductive success. We expected the highest decrease in the plant fruit and seed sets when the pollinators and ants were excluded, and a moderate decrease when solely ants were excluded, compared to the control plants (those exposed to pollinators and ants). In addition, a lower natural reproductive success was also expected in the self-incompatible D. longipetala than in the self-compatible D. floribunda, as the former totally depends on animal pollination for seed production. D. floribunda and D. longipetala presented similar trends in the response variables, and the expected results for the experimental treatments were observed, with some variations between species and among populations. The ecological function of nectar is important because these two plant species depend on pollinators to produce seeds and on ants to defend flowers from the endophytic larvae of Lepidoptera. The study of multispecies interactions through mechanistic experiments could be necessary to clarify the specific effects of different animals on plant reproductive success.",

We used a comparative phylogeographic approach to assess the effects of the Andean uplift on the mutualism between Azteca ants and an ant plant, Tococa guianensis, and to ask whether plant and ant diversification were promoted by geography or by the association. We used a combination of nuclear and organellar sequence data to resolve relationships between populations of ants and plants at sites spanning the northern Andes Cordillera in Colombia. To test for phylogenetic and chronological congruence between taxa and major uplift events, we used fossil calibrations and estimated the timing of diversification. We found phylogeographic structure in both Azteca and T. guianensis that coincides spatially and temporally with peaks of activity during the Andean uplift.

    "abstract": "The association between the myrmecophyte Triplaris and ants of the genus Pseudomyrmex is an often-reported example of mutualism in the Neotropics. The ants colonize the hollow stems of their hosts, and in exchange, the plants benefit from a reduced degree of herbivory. The previous studies have shown that workers can discriminate their host from other plants, including a closely related species. Little is known about how queens locate their host during the colonization process, but it has been suggested that host recognition is mediated by volatiles. Since queens of Pseudomyrmex mordax colonize their hosts during the seedling stage, we hypothesized that queens would discriminate leaves of seedlings from adult plants. To evaluate our hypothesis, we used a two-sided olfactometer, to test the preference of queens towards different leaf and plant ages of Triplaris americana. Virgin queens of Pseudomyrmex mordax preferred seedlings over adult plants, as well as plant leaves over empty controls, showing no discrimination for leaf age. Our results suggest that the volatiles virgin queens recognize are either produced or are more abundant at the early growing stage of the host when colonization is crucial for the host's survival.",

Specifically, I investigated patterns in ant community composition in 1-, 2-, & 5-yr-old plants, testing whether changes in ant occupancy with plant age affect the amount of herbivory sustained by the host plant.  Although 11 ant species were present in the plants studied, 4 species (Azteca pittieri Forel, Cephalotes setulifer Emery, Crematogaster carinata Mayr, Pseudomyrmex fortis Forel) accounted for the vast majority of occupied domatia.  The relative abundance of these species varied according to plot-level environmental variation, domatia position within plants, & plant age.  The 2 most abundant ant species, A. pittieri & C. carinata, were nearly mutually exclusive in the 5-yr-old plants & the interaction between these species affected the distribution & abundance of the third most abundant species, C. setulifer.  Coexistence of multiple ant species on the same host plant in this system appears to be promoted by heterogeneity in nest site availability, competitive interactions among species, different life history strategies, & interactions with other organisms.  The amount of herbivore damage on leaves surrounding domatia was affected by random environmental variation, plant age, fertilization, & the number of ants present.  For the 5-yr-old plants, local herbivory was not affected by fertilization, but was lower as a function of the number of workers in a domatium.  However, fertilization reduced herbivory & ant abundance had no effect for the 1-yr-old plants.]          *[Aximopsis affinis (Brues) (referred to as Conoaxima affinis) is a parasitoid of Azteca pittieri Forel.]",

We conducted a meta-analysis of ant-plant protective mutualisms to quantify the effects of ant defenders on plant reproductive output, to evaluate if reproductive effects were predicted from reductions in herbivory, & to identify characteristics of the plants, ants, & environment that explained variation in ant protection.  We also compared our approach with 2 other recent meta-analyses on ant-plant mutualisms, emphasizing differences in our methodology (using a weighted linear mixed effects model) & our focus on plant reproduction rather than herbivore damage.  Based on 59 ant & plant species pairs, ant presence increased plant reproductive output by 49% & reduced herbivory by 62%.  The effects on herbivory & reproduction within systems were positively correlated, but the slope of this relationship indicated that tolerance to foliar herbivory may be a common plant response to absence of ant guards.  Furthermore, the relationship between foliar damage & reproduction varied substantially among systems, suggesting that herbivore damage is not a reliable surrogate for fitness consequences of ant protection.  Studies that experimentally excluded ants reported a smaller effect of ant protection on plant reproduction than studies that relied upon natural variation in ant presence, suggesting that study methods can affect results in these systems.  Of the ecological variables included in our analysis, only plant life history (= annual or perennial) explained variation in the protective benefit of mutualistic ants: presence of ants benefitted reproduction of perennials significantly more than that of annuals.  These results contrast with other quantitative reviews of these relationships that did not include plant life history as an explanatory factor and raise several questions to guide future research on ant-plant protection mutualisms.]          *[We found no differences in protective effect among Dolichoderinae, Formicinae, & Myrmicinae, the 3 most common dominant subfamilies of ants in the dataset.

Relationships between genera in the tribe Cecropieae (Urticaceae), including Cecropia, Coussapoa, Musanga, Myrianthus, and Pourouma, are unknown and are necessary to investigate the evolutionary history of the Cecropia-ant mutualism. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the NADH dehydrogenase (ndhF) chloroplast gene region, the 26S region of nuclear ribosomal DNA, and an exon-primed intron-crossing DNA region support the position of non-myrmecophytic African Musanga within a paraphyletic Cecropia.

Host population size limits symbiont number, and distribution of partners is restricted by the presence and thus dispersal abilities of their respective partner. The Crematogaster decamera-Macaranga hypoleuca ant-plant symbiosis is obligate for both partners. Host survival depends on colonization by its ant partner while foundress queens require hosts for colony establishment. 2. An experimental approach and population genetic analyses were combined to estimate dispersal distances of foundresses in their natural habitat in a Bornean primary rainforest. 3. Colonization frequency was significantly negatively correlated with distance to potential reproductive colonies. Results were similar for seedlings at natural densities as well as for seedlings brought out in the area experimentally. Population genetic analysis revealed significant population differentiation with an FST of 0.041 among foundresses (n = 157) located at maximum 2280 m apart. In genetic spatial autocorrelation, genotypes of foundresses were significantly more similar than expected at random below 550 m and less similar above 620 m. Direct estimation of dispersal distances by pedigree analysis yielded an average dispersal distance of 468 m (maximum 1103 m). 4. For ants that disperse on the wing, genetic differentiation at such small spatial scales is unusual. The specific nesting requirements of the queens and the necessity for queens to find a host quickly could lead to colonization of the first suitable seedling encountered, promoting short dispersal distances. Nonetheless, dispersal distances of C. decamera queens may vary with habitat or host spatial distribution.",

This finding, which may be evidence for rapid ecological & genetic differentiation following a host shift, is a new insight into the previously suggested long-term co-diversification of Decacrema ants & Macaranga plants.]",

Because of the crucial trophic position of herbivores and their far-reaching impact on plant communities, it is important to understand how edge influences herbivory.  In the present paper, we investigated whether and how leaf-cutting ant foraging is altered in the forest edge, as this habitat is characterized by an increased proportion of pioneer species.  We assessed basic foraging data as well as the herbivory rate (i.e., the proportion of the leaf material harvested by a colony in relation to the available leaf area in the foraging area) of Atta cephalotes colonies at the edge versus interior sites of a large remnant of the Atlantic forest in Northeast Brazil. Our results indicated clear edge effects on leaf-cutting ants: equally sized A. cephalotes colonies located at the forest edge removed about twice as much leaf area from their foraging grounds than interior colonies (14.3 vs. 7.8%/col/yr).  This greater colony-level impact within the forest edge zone was a consequence of markedly reduced foraging areas (0.9 vs. 2.3 ha/col/yr) and moderately lower leaf area index in this habitat, whereas harvest rates were the same. Our results suggest that forest edges induce increased leaf-cutting ant herbivory, probably via the release of resource limitation. Together with the increase of leaf-cutting ant populations along forest edges, this may amplify environmental changes induced by habitat fragmentation.",

Yet, the agents of selection causing this variation have rarely been identified. Selection on the time of reproduction within a season in plants might differ both among populations and among years, and selection can be mediated by both mutualists and antagonists. We investigated if differences in the direction of phenotypic selection on flowering phenology among 20 populations of Gentiana pneumonanthe during 2 yr were related to the presence of the butterfly seed predator Phengaris alcon, and if butterfly incidence was associated with the abundance of the butterfly's second host, Myrmica ants. In plant populations without the butterfly, phenotypic selection favored earlier flowering. In populations where the butterfly was present, caterpillars preferentially attacked early\u0010flowering individuals, shifting the direction of selection to favoring later flowering. Butterfly incidence in plant populations increased with ant abundance. Our results demonstrate that antagonistic interactions can shift the direction of selection on flowering phenology, and suggest that such shifts might be associated with differences in the community context.",

Frequently, two ant species can share the same nest in a phenomenon known as 'parabiosis', but the exact nature (i.e., mutualistic or parasitic) of this interaction is the subject of debate.  We thus attempted to clarify the mutual costs and benefits for each partner (ants and plants) in the Crematogaster levior/Camponotus femoratus ant-garden parabiosis. The ants' response to experimental foliar damage to the epiphytes and to the host tree as well as their behavior and interactions during prey capture were investigated to see if the purported parasitic status of Cr. levior could be demonstrated in either the ant-ant or in the ant-plant interactions. The results show that both species take part in protecting the epiphytes, refuting the role of Cr. levior as a parasite of the ant-garden mutualism. During capture of large prey Ca. femoratus took advantage from the ability of Cr. Levior to discover prey; by following Cr. levior trails Ca. femoratus workers discover the prey in turn and usurp them during agonistic interactions. Nevertheless, the trade-off between the costs and benefits of this association seems then to be favorable to both species because it is known that Cr. levior benefits from Ca. femoratus building the common carton nests and furnishing protection from vertebrates. Consequently, parabiosis can then be defined as the only mutualistic association existing between ant species, at least in ant-gardens.",

M. guianensis is a small shrub that produces leaf pouches as ant domatia. Plants whose ants were experimentally removed suffered a significant increase in leaf damage compared with control plants (ants maintained). Ants patrol the young and mature leaves of Maieta with the same intensity, presumably since leaves of both ages are equally susceptible to herbivore attack.

    "abstract": "The ants Pheidole minutula and Crematogaster sp. are obligate inhabitants of the ant-plant Maieta guianensis. They nest and reproduce exclusively in this and a few other Amazon melastome ant-plants. Experimental transplants of uncolonized M. guianensis seedlings to sites at different distances from established colonies of these two ant species, which are sources of founding queens, have shown that distance is an important factor affecting seedling colonization by ants. The proportion of colonized seedlings and the average number of colonizations per seedling, both by Crematogaster sp. and P. minutula, decreased as distance from established colonies increased. Seedling colonization was also affected by rainfall and fewer seedlings were colonized during the dry season, especially by P. minutula, than during the rainy season. P. minutula queens usually cooperate with each other during colony foundation, a behavior not observed among founding queens of Crematogaster sp. Competition between these two ant species for host-plants appears to be strong as 63,6 % of the seedlings colonized by Crematogaster sp. were also colonized by P. minutula during a 15-month observational period. However, there was generally an interval of a few months between colonizations, possibly giving the first species to colonize the plant a better chance of domination on this plant.",

    "abstract": "*[A survey of two Amazonian melastome ant-plants, Maieta guianensis & Tococa bullifera, revealed a significant difference in plant size according to the species of ant inhabiting the plant.  Plants with Crematogaster laevis, on average, were smaller than those with Pheidole minutula (in M. guianensis) & those with Azteca sp. (in T. bullifera).  There is no evidence that these patterns were due either to the deterministic replacement of C. laevis by another ant species during host-plant ontogeny or to a habitat effect on plant growth rates coupled with colony survival.  More likely, the smaller size of C. laevis plants can be explained by its effects on host-plant performance.  Plants with C. laevis lost their associated ant colonies more frequently than plants with P. minutula & Azteca sp.   Plants that lost their C. laevis either died, or more commonly, were severely defoliated.  Defoliated plants, once sprouted, tended to become recolonized, but such recolonizations were not deterministic so as to favor one species over another.   Plants with C. laevis showed similar, or only slightly greater, standing levels of herbivory than plants with P. minutula or Azteca sp.   This suggests that when C. laevis is present, it confers some degree of protection to its hosts.   It was found that early in colony development, queens of C. laevis moved off their host plants to build satellite nests in dead twigs on the ground, a behavior not seen in the other 2 species & one that possibly renders colonies more vulnerable to mortality from predation, flooding, or nest decay.  Comparable 8-15N values in C. laevis & P. minutula indicate that the 2 species are equally dependent on food supplied by the host plant.]",

The diversity of plant symbioses / ants results from a large number of evolutionary convergence, with very little radiation.  The multilocus phylogeny obtained in this course allows to reconstruct the evolutionary history of 81 strains Chaetothyriales associated with ants.  This phylogeny includes these fungi into 3 major clades.  Diversification of these fungi therefore results from evolutionary radiation following a small number of appearances during evolution, unlike ants & associated plants.  In these systems, the diversity of symbionts has not been established by co-speciation, but rather by changes in hosts.  Given the existence of other types of association between ants and Chaetothyriales, it is possible that much of the diversification of the order is related to the association with ants.]",

    "abstract": "Although several studies have shown that ants can recognize chemical cues from their host plants in ant-plant systems, it is poorly demonstrated in ant gardens (AGs). In this interaction, ant species constantly interact with various epiphyte species. Therefore, it is possible to expect a convergence of chemical signals released by plants that could be acting to ensure that ants are able to recognize and defend epiphyte species frequently associated with AGs. In this study, it was hypothesized that ants recognize and differentiate among chemical stimuli released by AG epiphytes and non-AG epiphytes. We experimentally simulated leaf herbivore damage on three epiphyte species restricted to AGs and a locally abundant understory herb, Piper hispidum, in order to quantify the number of recruited Camponotus femoratus (Fabricius) defenders. When exposed to the AG epiphytes Peperomia macrostachya and Codonanthe uleana leaves, it was observed that the recruitment of C. femoratus workers was, on average, respectively 556% and 246% higher than control. However, the number of ants recruited by the AG epiphyte Markea longiflora or by the non-AG plant did not differ from paper pieces. This indicated that ants could discern between chemicals released by different plants, suggesting that ants can select better plants. These results can be explained by evolutionary process acting on both ants\u0019 capability in discerning plants' chemical compounds (innate attraction) or by ants\u0019 learning based on the epiphyte frequency in AGs (individual experience). To disentangle an innate behavior, a product of classical coevolutionary process, from an ant's learned behavior, is a complicated but important subject to understand in the evolution of ant-plant mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Sit-and-wait predators use different strategies to encounter potential prey. Rhinoleucophenga myrmecophaga Vidal et (Vidal et Vilela; Diptera: Drosophilidae) larvae build sticky shelters on top of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) of Qualea grandiflora Mart (Vochysiaceae), a common plant in the Brazilian cerrado savanna. Although larval shelters block the EFNs, nectar production is not obstructed and is used by the larvae to attract and trap nectar-gathering ants that are eventually eaten by the dipteran. Here we describe the natural history of R. myrmecophaga, its infestation pattern in Q. grandiflora, the ant assemblage at EFNs, and the insects used as prey. We use stable isotope composition (\u00a5\u03c0\u2265C and \u00a5\u03c0uN) of R. myrmecophaga and potential food sources to infer its diet, and perform chemical analyses of the droplets found at shelter openings to determine whether nectar is used as a prey attractant. We found that Rhinoleucophenga larvae occur on the majority of Qualea plants and occupy active EFNs mainly in the rainy season. The two most frequent visiting species were also the most common insects found trapped at larval shelters. The stable isotope analyses confirmed that ants are the main food sources of R. myrmecophaga. Chemical analyses and field observations revealed that Rhinoleucophenga larvae use extrafloral nectar to attract prey to their shelters by pushing this liquid to the shelter opening where it forms a droplet. This is a rare case of sit-and-wait predator exploiting an ant-plant mutualism through the use of the very food reward produced by the plant to attract and capture potential ant mutualists.          *[Brachymyrmex ants were the most common (26.9%) prey item captured by dipteran larvae, followed by Ca. crassus (14.1%).]",

    "abstract": "Ants commonly participate simultaneously in mutualisms with honeydew-producing hemipterans and extrafloral nectar-bearing host plants. These interactions are based on the exchange of resources (honeydew and extrafloral nectar) for ant protection against natural enemies. The benefits may vary according to the species of ant interacting, and the outcomes for the host plant and hemipteran will depend on the results of the ant-plant-hemipteran relationship as a whole. We studied a plant-mealybug association with Camponotus crassus Mayr (Formicinae) and Ectatomma tuberculatum Olivier (Ectatomminae) in a Brazilian tropical savanna. We aimed to elucidate whether the frequency of visitation by different species of ants can be affected by neighbouring colonies of mealybugs, and whether these ant species influence the number of hemipterans in a different way. Furthermore, we intended to find out whether the interaction between ant and hemipteran has any effect on the proportion of fruit production or on the abundance of trophobiont and non-trophobiont herbivores, also influenced by the ant species. Our results show that neighbouring aggregations of mealybugs influenced the frequency of ant visitation and the ants affected the number of nymphs over time, with both positive results only for C. crassus. We also detected an indirect negative effect on proportion of fruit production and an increase in abundance of trophobiont and non-trophobiont herbivores in the presence of C. crassus-mealybug interaction. Thus, we provide further evidence that colonies of hemipterans interacting with ants can be beneficial for these herbivorous insects, but they are quite harmful to the host plant. Nevertheless, the outcomes can be highly conditional in relation to ant species.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms that affect a host plant's ability to face herbivory are subjects of ongoing interest. Plant reproductive phenology plays a key role in the dynamics of communities in many ways. In ant-plant-herbivore interactions, host-plant phenology affects traits of its herbivores which in turn determine what traits ants must have to benefit the host-plant. Diversity of plant phenological traits could influence the ecological diversity of coevolved ant-plant mutualisms.In the Brazilian savanna, members of several plant families resprout and bloom simultaneously. However, some shrubs of the family Malpighiaceae exhibit sequential flowering, and four of these species also present extrafloral nectaries that attract ants. Here we determine whether their phenological patterns results in a shared herbivore guild and if this may be harmful to these plant species, making the association with ants critical to the plant optimal development and reproductive success. Plant phenology, herbivory, and the richness and abundance of ants and herbivores were recorded on control (with unrestricted ant access) and treatment (ant-excluded) shrubs. Floral-bud production and fruit set were also quantified. The plants flowered sequentially with brief periods of overlap, benefitting the guild of generalist herbivores. A cluster analysis indicated that 32 herbivore species were associated with these Malpighiaceae, with substantial species overlap. In all species, ants reduced leaf-area loss but not the damage to reproductive structures. Some floral herbivores presented adaptations to avoid or appease ants. We suggest that plant phenology directly influences the outcomes of these ant-plant-herbivore interactions and the related ecological networks.",

We tested for direct conflict by quantifying pollinator responses to flowers containing dead specimens of aggressive ant species, relative to unoccupied control flowers. We assessed indirect conflict by testing for the existence of a trade-off in sugar allocation between ant and pollinator rewards, evidenced by an increase in floral nectar secretion when extrafloral nectar secretion was prevented. Secretion of floral and extrafloral nectar, activity of ants and pollinators, and pollen deposition all overlapped in daily time and peaked within the first 2 h after flowers opened. We found evidence of direct conflict, in that presence of ants inside the flowers altered pollinator behavior and reduced visit duration, although visit frequency was unchanged. We found no evidence for indirect conflict, with no significant difference in the volume or sugar content of floral nectar between control plants and those in which extrafloral nectar secretion was prevented.

    "abstract": "Ant guards protect plants from herbivores, but can also hinder pollination by damaging reproductive structures and/or repelling pollinators. Natural selection should favour the evolution of plant traits that deter ants from visiting flowers during anthesis, without waiving their defensive services. The Distraction Hypothesis posits that rewarding ants with extrafloral nectar could reduce their visitation of flowers, reducing ant\u0010pollinator conflict while retaining protection of other structures. We characterised the proportion of flowers occupied by ants and the number of ants per flower in a Mexican ant\u0010plant, Turnera velutina. We clogged extrafloral nectaries on field plants and observed the effects on patrolling ants, pollinators and ants inside flowers, and quantified the effects on plant fitness. Based on the Distraction Hypothesis, we predicted that preventing extrafloral nectar secretion should result in fewer ants active at extrafloral nectaries, more ants inside flowers and a higher proportion of flowers occupied by ants, leading to ant\u0010pollinator conflict, with reduced pollinator visitation and reduced plant fitness. Overall ant activity inside flowers was low. Preventing extrafloral nectar secretion through clogging reduced the number of ants patrolling extrafloral nectaries, significantly increased the proportion of flowers occupied by ants from 6.1% to 9.7%, and reduced plant reproductive output through a 12% increase in the probability of fruit abortion. No change in the numbers of ants or pollinators inside flowers was observed. This is the first support for the Distraction Hypothesis obtained under field conditions, showing ecological and plant fitness benefits of the distracting function of extrafloral nectar during anthesis. Synthesis. Our study provides the first field experimental support for the Distraction Hypothesis, suggesting that extrafloral nectaries located close to flowers may bribe ants away from reproductive structures during the crucial pollination period, reducing the probability of ant occupation of flowers, reducing ant\u0010pollinator conflict and increasing plant reproductive success.          *[Text (p. 1381-1382) list 10 ant species interacting with T. velutina.

To test whether the higher investment in sexuals (and thus lower investment in protective workers) previously documented on the colonization front is compensated by a more effective protective behaviour, we compared ant behavioural investment in plant defence between two populations, one in the core of the range and one on the colonization front. We induced ant patrolling activity by artificially damaging leaflets and measured this activity by counting patrolling ants and calculating the increase relative to constitutive patrolling activity measured on control (undamaged) leaflets. Contrary to our expectation, ant behavioural investment in plant defence was lower on the colonization front. Thus, production of fewer workers is not compensated by more protective behaviour of each. Instead, both traits contribute to a phenotype that is less mutualistic as a whole. By favouring increased allocation to dispersal, range expansion can shape ant behavioural traits and potentially the outcome of mutualism.",

    "abstract": "Based on pure culture studies and DNA phylogenetic analyses, black yeasts (Chaetothyriales, Ascomycota) are shown to be widely distributed and important components of numerous plant-ant-fungus networks, independently acquired by several ant lineages in the Old and New World. Data from ITS and LSU nu rDNA demonstrate that a high biodiversity of fungal species is involved. There are two common ant-fungus symbioses involving black yeasts: (1) on the carton walls of ant nests and galleries, and (2) the fungal mats growing within non-pathogenic naturally hollow structures (so-called domatia) provided by myrmecophytic plants as nesting space for ants (ant-plant symbiosis). Most carton- and domatia-inhabiting fungi stem from different phylogenetic lineages within Chaetothyriales, and almost all of the fungi isolated are still undescribed. Despite being closely related, carton and domatia fungi are shown to differ markedly in their morphology and ecology, indicating that they play different roles in these associations. The carton fungi appear to improve the stability of the carton, and several species are commonly observed to co-occur on the same carton. Carton fungi commonly have dark-walled monilioid hyphae, colouring the carton blackish and apparently preventing other fungi from invading the carton. Despite the simultaneous presence of usually several species of fungi, forming complex associations on the carton, little overlap is observed between carton fungi from different ant species, even those that co-occur in nature, indicating at least some host specificity of fungi. Most fungi present on carton belong to Chaetothyriales, but in a few samples, Capnodiales are also an important component. Carton fungi are difficult to assign to anamorph genera, as most lack conidiation. The domatia fungi are more specific. In domatia, usually only one or two fungal species co-occur, producing a dense layer on living host plant tissue in domatia. They have hyaline or light brown thin-walled hyphae, and are commonly sporulating. In both carton and domatia, the fungal species seem to be specific to each ant-plant symbiosis. Representative examples of carton and domatia ant-fungus symbioses are illustrated. We discuss hypotheses on the ecological significance of the Chaetothyriales associated with ants.",

(Gentianales: Rubiaceae) and how arboreal ant communities are structured in relation to M. beccarii presence on trees. Myrmecodia beccarii was inhabited by the ant Philidris cordata Smith, F. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on the majority of Melaleuca viridiflora Sol. Ex Gaertn. (Myrtales: Myrtaceae) trees with ant-occupied ant-plants at our two sites. Dominant arboreal ant species at both study sites exhibited discrete, nonoverlapping distributions, and C-score analysis detected an ant mosaic at one site. The distribution of P. cordata was limited by the distribution of ant-plants for both sites. Philidris cordata dominance on trees was also determined by the presence of M. beccarii occupied by P. cordata at both sites. We suggest that by providing P. cordata with nesting space M. beccarii plays a role in structuring these arboreal ant communities.",

    "abstract": "1. As central place foragers, ants accumulate organic debris near their nests. Consequently, soil nutrient stocks are often enriched near the nest site. We investigated the hypothesis that plant-derived food sources, such as extrafloral nectar (EFN), can encourage soil-dwelling ant colonies to nest near the plant, thereby inadvertently providing the plant with an additional source of mineral nutrients. The study focused on a population of Acacia constricta, a North American shrub bearing EFNs. 2. Several lines of evidence supported the notion that food rewards drew ant nests close to A. constricta plants. Firstly, ant species that visit EFNs nested significantly closer to A. constricta plants than would be expected by chance, whereas this was not the case for two ant species that do not visit EFNs. Secondly, A. constricta plants with an ant nest occurring naturally underneath the canopy had greater foliar volume, more EFNs per leaf and more EFNs per cm of leaf rachis than plants lacking an ant nest under the canopy. Thirdly, experimental supplementation of the nectar resources on acacias led to the establishment of significantly more new nests near the plant, relative to controls. However, nectar supplementation did not affect acacia seed production within the year of the study. 3. Soil from the nests of three, EFN-visiting ant species contained higher average stocks of most mineral nutrients than nearby soils outside the influence of the nest. 4. To test whether A. constricta can assimilate the nutrients in ant nests, we fed 15N-labelled food to Dorymyrmex sp. (smithi complex) workers nesting near acacias. Twenty-four days later, the leaves of acacias with an experimentally fed ant colony under the canopy contained significantly higher 15N and %N than acacias without a nest under the canopy, indicating that acacias assimilated and benefited from nutrients derived from ants. 5. Synthesis. The results indicate that nectar resources can attract the nests of some ant species, and that plants may benefit from access to soil nutrients derived from ant nests. Our data support the hypothesis that EFNs may confer nutritive, as well as protective, benefits.",

    "abstract": "The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), is a significant pest species, having become established on almost every continent, particularly in areas with a Mediterranean climate. In its introduced range, the Argentine ant has been associated with reductions in the abundance and diversity of native ant and nonant invertebrate fauna, as well as the interruption of ant-plant-mutualisms. The distribution of Argentine ants has been correlated with particular abiotic factors, including soil moisture, relative humidity, disturbance, and particular soil and vegetation types. This study assessed the importance of temperature on the survival of Argentine ants and two native ant species (Iridomyrmex \"rufoniger\" and Rhytidoponera \"convexa\") in the laboratory. Workers were placed in incubators of varying temperatures (25, 32, 40, 45, 47, and 50 C), and counts of the numbers dead and alive were recorded after 1, 2, and 3 h. The results showed that all species displayed almost 100% survival at 25, 32, 40, and 45 C, but at 47 C the mortality rate of all species increased, with Argentine ants experiencing 100% mortality after 3 h. At 50 C, Argentine ants displayed no survival at 1 h, whereas the Iridomyrmex exhibited approximately = to 50% survival after 3 h. These results may have significant implications in Australia, where the ground surface temperatures may become very high during the summer, potentially limiting the spread of Argentine ants.",

The removal of seeds by granivorous ants can affect plant recruitment through either seed loss from predation or the dispersal and recruitment of seeds that are removed but not consumed. Consequently, variation in ant selection preferences can influence patterns of seed removal and affect plant community composition, including the spread of exotic plant species. 2. We conducted a seed removal experiment to determine whether: 1) rates of removal by ants differed between three native and three exotic grass species in an Australian temperate grassland; and 2) differences in removal rates were associated with the presence or absence of awns. 3. We found that seeds of the three exotic species, none of which had awns, were removed by ants at a higher rate than those of the three native species, all of which had awns. Removal rates of native species increased when awns were manually removed, suggesting the awns of native species acted as a removal barrier. 4. While we do not know the fate of seeds removed from our experiment, differences among species in removal rates mirrored differences in their spatial spread in a separate seed addition experiment. Exotic species removed by ants at a higher rate in the removal experiment had more widely dispersed seedlings than native species in the seed addition experiment, potentially indicating a role for granivorous ants in dispersing exotic seeds. Identifying ant selection preferences and directly linking removal to seed fate could help explain how exotic grass species move around the landscape.",

    "abstract": "Plant species introduced to new regions can escape their natural enemies but may also lose important mutualists. While mutualistic interactions are often considered too diffuse to limit plant invasion, few studies have quantified the strength of interactions in both the native and introduced ranges, and assessed whether any differences are linked to invasion outcomes. For three Acacia species adapted for ant dispersal (myrmecochory), we quantified seed removal probabilities associated with dispersal and predation in both the native (Australian) and introduced (New Zealand) ranges, predicting lower removal attributable to dispersal in New Zealand due to a relatively depauperate ant fauna. We used the role of the elaiosome to infer myrmecochory, and included treatments to measure vertebrate seed removal, since this may become an important determinant of seed fate in the face of reduced dispersal. We then tested whether differences in seed removal patterns could explain differences in the invasion success of the three Acacia species in New Zealand. Overall seed removal by invertebrates was lower in New Zealand relative to Australia, but the difference in removal between seeds with an elaiosome compared to those without was similar in both countries. This implies that the probability of a removed seed being dispersed by invertebrates was comparable in New Zealand to Australia. The probability of seed removal by vertebrates was similar and low in both countries. Differences in the invasive success of the three Acacia species in New Zealand were not explained by differences in levels of seed predation or the strength of myrmecochorous interactions. These findings suggest that interactions with ground foraging seed predators and dispersers are unlikely to limit the ability of Acacia species to spread in New Zealand, and could not explain their variable invasion success.",

    "abstract": "Plant volatiles influence virtually all forms of ant-plant symbioses. However, little is known about their role in the mutualistic relationship between the African weaver ant and the cashew tree. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that cashew tree volatiles from plant parts most vulnerable to herbivory viz. inflorescence, leaves, and fruits, are attractive to weaver ants. Using behavioral assays, we show that these volatiles attract weaver ants but without significant difference in preference for any of the odors. These same plant parts are associated with extra floral nectaries (EFNs') and therefore we evaluated the possibility that the ants associate the volatiles with food rewards. We found that perception of the odors was followed by a searching response that led the ants to non-volatile sugar rewards. More importantly, we observed that weaver ants spent significantly more time around the odor when it was paired to a reward. Chemical analysis of volatiles showed that the plant parts shared similarities in chemical composition, dominated by monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Additionally, we evaluated the attractiveness of a synthetic blend of three ocimene isomers ((E)-beta-ocimene, (Z)-beta-ocimene and allo-ocimene) identified in cashew leaf odor and shown to constitute a candidate kairomone for the cashew pest Pseudotheraptus wayi. We found that the attractiveness of the blend was dose dependent, and the response of the ants was not significantly different to that established with the crude volatiles from plant tissues. These results present new and interesting possibilities for improving weaver ant performance in cashew pest management.

    "abstract": "The ant subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae comprises three genera of hyperoptic, arboreal ants, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions: Pseudomyrmex (~200 species, New World), Myrcidris (two species, South America) and Tetraponera (~100 species, Palaeotropics). The phylogenetic relationships among these ants were investigated using DNA sequence data (~5.2kb from 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, wingless, abdominal-A, and long-wavelength rhodopsin genes) and 144 morphological characters, both separately and in combination. Data were gathered from a representative set of forty-nine pseudomyrmecine species, plus eighteen species from various outgroups. There was substantial agreement among the results obtained from different datasets, and from different methods of phylogenetic inference (parsimony, Bayesian inference). The monophyly of the following groups is strongly supported (100% bootstrap support and 1.00 posterior probability in the molecular dataset): Pseudomyrmecinae, Pseudomyrmex, and Pseudomyrmex + Myrcidris. The status of the genus Tetraponera is less clear: the DNA sequence data indicate that the genus is paraphyletic, but morphological features and a unique insertion in the 28S gene support the monophyly of this taxon. Seven of nine Pseudomyrmex species groups, established previously on the basis of morphology alone, are strongly upheld, but monophyly is rejected for the P. pallens group and the P. viduus group. In the latter case, molecular evidence indicates the existence of two independent clades, associated with the ant-plants Triplaris and Tachigali, respectively, whose convergent morphological features had caused them to be placed erroneously in the same species group. The present results confirm an earlier assertion that obligate associations with domatia-bearing plants have arisen at least twelve times in the subfamily. Molecular and morphological data support the hypothesis of a sister-group relationship between Pseudomyrmecinae and Myrmeciinae (84% parsimony bootstrap, combined dataset), which implies a Cretaceous origin of the stem-group pseudomyrmecines in the southern hemisphere. Pseudomyrmecines appear to have arisen in the Palaeotropics and later dispersed from Africa to South America, where they experienced a pronounced burst of diversification.",

We then transplant these plants S & N of the ant boundary to test whether distinct ant climate requirements disrupt the ant-plant mutualism.  The early blooming plant's inability to synchronize with the warm-adapted ant leaves its populations clumped & patchy & its seedlings clustered around the parents in natural populations.  When transplanted into the range of the cold-adapted ant, effective seed dispersal recovers.  In contrast, the mutualism persists for the later blooming plant regardless of location because it sets seed later in spring, when both warm- & cold-adapted ant species forage, resulting in effective seed dispersal.  These results indicate that the climate response of species interactions, not just the species themselves, is integral in understanding ecological responses to a changing climate.

    "abstract": "Some interactions previously describe as mutualistic were revealed to be commensal or parasitic in subsequent investigations. Ant-mediated seed dispersal has been describe as a mutualism for more than a century; however, recent research suggests that it may be commensal or parasitic. Plants demonstrably benefit from ant-mediated seed dispersal, although there is little evidence available to demonstrate that the interaction benefits long-term ant fitness.  Field experiments were conducted in temperate North America focused on a key seed-dispersing ant. All herbaceous plants were removed from a forest understorey for 13 years, and supplemented ant colonies with large elaiosome-bearing seeds aiming to examine potential long-and short-term myrmecochorous plant benefits for the ants.  If elaiosome-bearing seeds benefit ants, suggesting a mutualistic relationship, it is expected that there would be greater worker and/or alate abundance and greater fat reserves (colony lipid content) with seed supplementation (short-term) and in areas with high understorey herb abundance.  Short-term seed supplementation of ant colonies did not result in an increase with respect to numbers or fat stores, although it did prompt the production of colony sexuals, which is a potential fitness benefit. In the long term, however, there was no positive effect on the ants and, instead, there were negative effects because the removal of elaiosome-bearing plants corresponded with greater colony health.  The data obtained in the present study suggest that the ant-plant interaction ranged from occasionally beneficial to neutral to overall negative for the ant partner. Such results did not support considering the interaction as a mutualism. Collectively, the data suggest the need to reconsider the nature of the relationship between these ants and plants.

    "abstract": "Hutchinsonian niche theory posits that organisms have fundamental abiotic resource requirements from which they are limited by competition. Organisms also have fundamental biotic requirements, such as mutualists, for which they also might compete.  We test this idea with a widespread ant-plant mutualism. Ant-mediated seed dispersal (myrmecochory) in eastern North America involves a few ant species that can effectively disperse the seeds of many plant species. This imbalance suggests that ant-dispersed plants (myrmecochores) might compete for ant dispersers. We hypothesized that, because larger seeds are more attractive to ants, myrmecochores might segregate the timing of seed release by size to relieve competition.  Comparative literature analysis across plant species reveals that myrmecochore seed size increases with the fruiting season in a staggered pattern so that small- and large-seeded co-occurring species do not release seeds at the same time - a pattern not observed in plants using other dispersal modes.  We then presented foraging ants with small and large seeds in field trials throughout the fruiting season to test whether the observed temporal se gregation in myrmecochore seed size is consistent with plant competition for ant dispersers. Our results show that dispersal rates for smaller seeds increase across the growing season, but only in the absence of large seeds. Our combined literature and field data suggest that myrmecochores stagger fruiting by seed size so that small seeds are set earlier to avoid competition for dispersal mutualists with larger seeds.  Synthesis. Ecological interactions are often treated as either positive or negative, but our data blur this distinction by revealing that a positive interaction (mutualism) might be structured by a negative interaction (competition). Moreover, the recognition of biotic resources as critical niche requirements blurs the classic dichotomy between the fundamental (abiotic) versus realized (biotic limited) niche.",

Little is known about the genus Ryparosa (Achariaceae), and the appearance of outgrowths on leaves and stems of glasshouse-raised R. kurrangii seedlings suggested that the species may produce food bodies. Detailed macroimaging and histological techniques were used to characterize chemomorphological variation in food body material gathered from glasshouse plants. Two distinct types of food body were observed. Multicellular pearl bodies derived from epidermal and mesophyll tissue were produced on young leaves and stems, and contained lipids and glycogen-like carbohydrates. A unique form of lipid-rich multicellular food body that 'opens' during development was found exclusively on mature plant tissue. A filament network was associated with food body lipid droplets. This is the first detailed documentation of food body production in an understorey genus adapted to low light conditions. We suggest that the distinctive spatial deployment of Ryparosa food rewards, and the ants attracted to them, may be invaluable for keeping long-lived leaves free from epiphyllous communities.",

    "abstract": "Ant-plant relationships, with variability in both intimacy and the trophic structure of associations, are described for the Austro-Malesian rainforest tree genus Ryparosa (Achariaceae). The range of associations involves opportunistic interactions between plants and foraging ants, mediated by food bodies, and tighter associations in which ant colonies, tending hemipteran trophobionts, reside permanently in plant structures with different degrees of adaptation to house ants. Our study provides strong baseline data to suggest that Ryparosa could become a new model system for examining the evolutionary radiation of ant-related traits. To define the diversity of ant-plant associations in Ryparosa, we first present a review of ant-plant terminology and an outline of its use in this study. Field studies of ant interactions with food bodies in myrmecotrophic R. kurrangii from Australia and the association between myrmecoxenic R. fasciculata and two Cladomyrma plant-ant species on the Malay Peninsula provide detailed examples of ant-plant interactions. An examination of herbarium material revealed a diverse range of ant-plant associations in other Ryparosa taxa. All 27 species had evidence of food body production, seven species had evidence of stem inhabitation by ants, five species had specialized stem domatia, and the domatia of R. amplifolia featured prostomata. Variation in the specificity of Ryparosa ant-plant interactions is discussed in relation to known ant partners and other ant-plant associations.",

    "abstract": "Three species of epiphytic Dischidia have been investigated in terms of their relationship to ants on trees. Two species, D. parvifolia and D. astephana, are associated with ants and trees in montane areas. A clear association has been found between ants of the genus Crematogaster and the tree Leptospermum flavescens. This relationship is complex and probably both organisms benefit from the association. The ants live in tunnels in the wood of the major branches and the trunk, and the entire tree is occupied by one ant colony. Trees occupied by ants are maintained by the ants substantially clear of epiphytes other than the two species of Dischidia. The potential benefits to the tree and to the ants of this association are noted. The roots of D. astephana and D. parvifolia penetrate into the cavities of these ant nests and presumably gain nutrients from waste in the ant nests. Both Dischidia species are effectively scavenging upon the waste material from the ant-tree association. The leathery dome-shaped leaves of D. astephana are not vital to the development of the scavenging habit as D. parvifolia has lens-shaped leaves, but may offer some advantage to D. astephana by the uptake of nutrients from waste deposited by the ants under the dome-shaped leaves by interception of stem flow and by uptake of gaseous waste. Ants do not nest under these leaves. Seeds of these species of Dischidia are taken by ants into the central woody area of the ant nest where they germinate. Both Leptospermum and Dischidia can be visualized as showing adaptations to a nutient-deficient tropical montane environment. These adaptations are discussed as is the need for reassessment in this genus of the term 'ant-plant', and the need for wider recognition of the \u0018ant-tree\u0019 relationship between Crematogaster and Leptospermum.",

The ants inhabit trunk and branch domatia and respond aggressively to foreign invaders. Their degree of host specificity and basis for recognition of host trees has not been studied. We determined that, in contrast to T. americana seedlings, heterospecific seedlings set around the host trees suffered continuous pruning. Ants also removed 80-100 percent of heterospecific leaves attached to the trunk in contrast to only 10-30 percent of conspecific leaves. True species specificity was demonstrated by the selective removal of leaves from Triplaris poeppigiana pinned to host trees. This selectivity was also observed in a matrix-independent bioassay using leaf cuticular extracts on glass microfiber strips. Strips treated with leaf wax extracts from host trees and pinned to the trunk of host trees received only 42 percent of the number of ant visits recorded on solvent-treated controls by the end of the experiment. Strips treated with extracts of a related species, T. poeppigiana, received 64 percent of the number of ant visits compared with solvent-treated controls. These experiments also suggest that P. triplarinus recognizes surface chemicals of their host tree, independent of the texture or architecture of the carrier material; although these factors may still play some role in recognition. This is the first study that we are aware of to investigate the mechanism of host discrimination related to pruning behavior.

    "abstract": "*[Camponotus irritabilis (Formicidae: Formicinae) and Hoya elliptica (Apocynaceae) are very closely associated in ant gardens in Malaya and Sumatra. Ants and epiphyte partners have some characteristics that make them especially suitable for this association: The ants selectively retrieve the seeds of their epiphyte partners, and they fertilize their carton nests on which the plants are growing. In comparison to non-myrmecophytic Hoya coriacea, Hoya elliptica performs an extensive root growth as long as growing on moist substrate. The roots stabilize the ants' nests and anchor them to the host tree. Camponotus irritabilis initiate ant gardens by constructing carton buildings on branches, which serve as substrate for incorporated seeds and climbing parts of already established Hoya elliptica. Camponotus irritabilis influence actively the available chamber size within their nests, by biting off roots, fertilizing only certain parts of the nests and retrieving seeds into the 'growing zone' of the nest building. Ants thereby prevent uninhibited, space-consuming root growth, but influence stability and architecture of the ant garden by guiding the spread out of the roots. As additional partners of the ant garden system, trophobionts, undetermined fungi on the inner nest substrate, several parabiotic Crematogaster spp. and a probably lestobiotic Solenopsis sp. were found. Similarity in genus composition of the three co-occurring ants, as well as behaviors of Camponotus irritabilis, degree of the mutual benefits with the epiphytes and phenology of this ant garden association might represent a remarkable case of convergence with neotropical ant gardens.]",

The aim of this study was to assess the length of the flowering period in Pulsatilla slavica and P. vulgaris and to investigate the structure of the epidermis of the perianth and generative elements of their flowers. Special focus was placed on the structure of hairs and the distribution of stomata. The weight of nectar released by the flowers of the two Pulsatilla species and the content of sugars in the nectar was also evaluated. In SE Poland, both species flowered for similar periods between the second half of April and the first half of May. The flower life-span of both was determined to be 9-14 days. The lower part of each sepal was observed to be covered by long hairs having cellulose-pectin cell walls of varying thickness. Hairs present on the pistil style are thinner; they may provide some protection against cold and can play a role of a secondary pollen presenter for insects. The bowl-shaped structure of the perianth and the nature of the adaxial surface of the sepal epidermis may facilitate reflection of sunlight into the inner parts of the flower, which may contribute to an elevation of the intraflower temperature. This is particularly important for the functionality of the ovary. The surface of the hairs was seen to be covered by a cuticle ensuring water impermeability. Flowers are visited by honeybees, bumblebees, butterflies, and ants, for which nectar and pollen are the main attractants. Ants, which are regarded as illegitimate flower visitors, were found to cause damage to the androecium. The number of fruits produced in the flowers of both Pulsatilla species was lower than 50% of the number of pistils.",

    "abstract": "Although mutualisms are common in all ecological communities and have played key roles in the diversification of life, our current understanding of the evolution of cooperation applies mostly to social behavior within a species. A central question is whether mutualisms persist because hosts have evolved costly punishment of cheaters. Here, we use the economic theory of employment contracts to formulate and distinguish between two mechanisms that have been proposed to prevent cheating in host-symbiont mutualisms, partner fidelity feedback (PFF) and host sanctions (HS). Under PFF, positive feedback between host fitness and symbiont fitness is sufficient to prevent cheating; in contrast, HS posits the necessity of costly punishment to maintain mutualism. A coevolutionary model of mutualism finds that HS are unlikely to evolve de novo, and published data on legume-rhizobia and yucca-moth mutualisms are consistent with PFF and not with HS. Thus, in systems considered to be textbook cases of HS, we find poor support for the theory that hosts have evolved to punish cheating symbionts; instead, we show that even horizontally transmitted mutualisms can be stabilized via PFF. PFF theory may place previously underappreciated constraints on the evolution of mutualism and explain why punishment is far from ubiquitous in nature.",

    "abstract": "*[Benefits derived from adventive insects can be extended to the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta).  It not only can be a useful predator under certain conditions & provided insights into the evolution of social organization in insects, but also helped shape the career of Edward O. Wilson, indirectly promoting studies in insect biodiversity.  Wilson's discovery of the ant at Mobile, Alabama, when he was only 13, represented the earliest U.S. record of the species & his first scientific observation.  At 19, he took a leave of absence from the University of Alabama to study the fire ant's spread & impact.  This work for the state conservation department was the first professional position for a biologist who would popularize biodiversity studies & become a leading scientist of the 20th century.  The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) might facilitate the success of an immigrant mealybug (Antonina graminis) that uses the ant's honeydew.  Medical effects from invasive insects include  life-threatening envenomation & hypersensitive reactions from adventive hymenopterans such as red imported fire ant, & other ant species.  Hybridization & introgression, though apparently uncommon in insects, occur in between the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) & an immigrant congener (S. richteri) in a portion of their U.S. range.  Ants are among the more spectacular of invasive organisms; several hundred species have been or are being moved in global trade.  Those moving readily in commerce (the so-called tramp species) afford opportunities for behavioral, ecological, & evolutionary studies relevant to conservation & agriculture.  Immigrant ants not only can reduce biodiversity, but also can disrupt the biological control of plant pests & disassemble native ant communities.  Immigrant ants, in turn, sometimes are replaced by later-arriving ant species.  The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) adversely affects various invertebrate & vertebrate groups. There are recent review of the causes & consequences of ant invasions, of the effects of the red imported fire ant on biodiversity, & critiques of purported ecological effects from this fire ant.  In the Cape fynbos flora (South Africa), the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) has displaced native ants associated with certain precinctive proteaceous plants whose seeds are ant dispersed (myrmecochores).   Detected in the Seychelles islands in the 1960s, Anoplolepis gracilipes also has begun to affect biodiversity on Bird Island in the Seychelles, following its discovery in the 1980s.  Other immigrant ants that cause adverse environmental effects, including the bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala) in Hawaii & other Pacific islands, & the little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata) in the Galapagos.]",

Larger ants tended to remove diaspores alone & remove diaspores faster than smaller ones.  Ants that removed diaspores alone removed more diaspores than ants that removed diaspores in groups.  However, we did not find a linear relationship between ant size & diaspore removal.  This is likely due to a limitation on, or a preference by larger ants for removing larger diaspores, while the smaller diaspores may have hindered manipulation or been less attractive to larger ants.

    "abstract": "Historic and current land-use changes have altered the landscape for grassland biota, with over 90% of grasslands and savannas converted to agriculture or some other use in north temperate regions. Reintegrating grasslands into agricultural landscapes can increase biodiversity while also providing valuable ecosystem services. In contrast to their well-known importance in tropical and subtropical ecosystems, the role of ants in temperate grasslands is often underappreciated. As consumers and ecosystem engineers, ants in temperate grasslands influence invertebrate, plant, and soil microbial diversity and potentially alter grassland productivity. As common and numerically dominant invertebrates in grasslands, ants can also serve as important indicator species to monitor conservation and management practices. Drawing on examples largely from mesic, north temperate studies, and from other temperate regions where necessary, we review the roles of ants as consumers and ecosystem engineers in grasslands. We also identify five avenues for future research to improve our understanding of the roles of ants in grasslands. This includes identifying how grassland fragmentation may influence ant community assembly, quantifying how ant communities impact ecosystem functions and soil processes, and understanding how ant communities and their associated interactions are impacted by climate change. In synthesizing the role of ants in temperate grasslands and identifying knowledge gaps, we hope this and future work will help inform how land managers maximize grassland conservation value while increasing multiple ecosystem services and minimizing disservices.          *[Myrmica scabrinodis misspelled Myrmica scabrindis.]",

Other kinds of disturbances, such as herbivore presence, artificial & natural damage, or even shaking have been shown to induce increased ant activity on ant-plants.  In contrast, rain events may be considered a type of disturbance that reduces ant activity.  Overall, termites were attacked by nine ant species.  A Crematogaster & 2-Camponotus species accounted for about 75% of the attacks in both the control & the watering treatments.  The 2 genera exhibited different behaviors after the application of water.   Crematogaster workers took cover between flower bud & bracts, remaining there without patrolling the outer surface of the bracts.

Nest entrance measurements revealed that large seeds such as those of P. reflexus & L. cordifolium were too large to be accommodated in the nests of small ant species as well as most of the large ant species.  In these cases, seeds were discarded on the soil surface where some of the benefits of myrmecochory, including protection of seeds from desiccation & rodent predation, would not be realized.  The study showed that myrmecochorous plants with small seeds will probably not be affected to the same extent as those with large seeds by the displacement of large species of ants by L. humile.

We measured frond length from early emergence to senescence during two consecutive years in three clonal patches dominated by P. arachnoideum and associated the resulting growth pattern with the local canopy closure. Pteridium arachnoideum exhibited average frond length and growth rate higher than previously reported for this species and for congeneric species. Frond mortality was generally high shortly after emergence from the ground, but was also much higher in one study site due to ant herbivory. Fronds of P. arachnoideum were higher, showed petiole elongation and higher mortality rate under high canopy closure, suggesting shading avoidance, in contrast to the shade tolerance reported for Pteridium aquilinum. Although our findings indicate that this species is unlikely to represent a threat to the biodiversity of undisturbed Brazilian savanna-riparian forest transitions with continuous canopy, they also suggest that introduction of fast growing tree species with dense canopy may accelerate the restoration of more disturbed and degraded sites.",

We studied resource competition and plant defense in a guild of ants that use the same EFN resource provided by two species of Passiflora in a seasonal rain forest in tropical China. At least 22 ant species were recorded using the EFN resource, although some of those species were rare. Among these ants, Paratrechina sp.1 and Dolichoderus thoracicus were more aggressive than other species. Ant aggressiveness measured as ant behavioral dominance index (BDI) was positively correlated with ant abundance on the Passiflora species studied. Ant BDI was also positively correlated to the protection that ants provided against herbivory. In Passiflora siamica, the number of workers patrolling on the plants did negatively correlate with average leaf loss per plant. We conclude that in this facultative Passiflora-ant system, plant defense upon herbivore was indeed influenced by the total number of ants present on plant and the aggressiveness of these ants.",

However, ants often negatively affect plant reproduction by deterring pollinators. The aggressive protection that mutualistic ants provide to some myrmecophytes may enhance this negative effect in comparison to plant species that are facultatively protected by ants. Because little is known about the processes by which myrmecophytes are pollinated in the presence of ant guards, we examined ant interactions with herbivores and pollinators on plant reproductive organs. We examined eight myrmecophytic and three nonmyrmecophytic Macaranga species in Borneo. Most of the species studied are pollinated by thrips breeding in the inflorescences. Seven of eight myrmecophytic species produced food bodies on young inflorescences and/or immature fruits. Food body production was associated with increased ant abundance on inflorescences of the three species observed. The exclusion of ants from inflorescences of one species without food rewards resulted in increased herbivory damage. In contrast, ant exclusion had no effect on the number of pollinator thrips. The absence of thrips pollinator deterrence by ants may be due to the presence of protective bracteoles that limit ants, but not pollinators, from accessing flowers. This unique mechanism may account for simultaneous thrips pollination and ant defense of inflorescences.",

    "abstract": "Flowering plants have modified their floral organs in remarkably diverse ways to optimize their interaction with pollinators. Although floral organs represent a major source of floral diversity, many plants also use extrafloral organs, such as bracts and bracteoles, in interacting with pollinators; however, the evolutionary dynamics of non-floral organs involved in pollination are poorly studied. The genus Macaranga is characterized by protective mutualisms with ants that potentially interfere with pollinators on flowers. Macaranga flowers lack perianths and, notably, bracteoles serve the dual function of rewarding pollinators and protecting them from guarding ants; in one group of species, bracteoles provide a nectar reward to generalist pollinators, while in another group, bracteole \"chambers\" protect thrips or hemipteran pollinators that use these structures as feeding and breeding sites. We examined the diversity and evolutionary dynamics of inflorescence morphology in Macaranga, focusing on bracteoles. We recognized three inflorescence types based on examination of herbarium materials: Discoid-gland, which possess disc-shaped glands on the bracteole surfaces (including all the generalist-pollinated species); Enclosing, in which bracteoles cover flowers (including all the thrips- and hemipteran-pollinated species); and Inconspicuous, in which bracteoles are small, narrow or absent. Ancestral state reconstruction indicated that inflorescence morphologies have changed multiple times in the genus. These findings suggest that morphological changes in non-floral characters (bracteoles) of Macaranga species have occurred as frequently as in the floral structures of many flowering plants. The multiple evolutions of the Enclosing bracteoles, which protect pollinators, might have been facilitated by pollination interference from mutualistic ants.",

To evaluate the effect of soil nutrients on multiple plant defences, we cultivated Mallotus japonicus under three soil nutritional conditions in the field, and experimentally examined the expression of a physical defence trait (trichomes), chemical traits (pellucid dots), and biotic traits (extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and pearl bodies) of the plants, and the number of ants visiting them. Under the low soil nutritional condition, plants strongly expressed the physical defence by trichomes and chemical defence by pellucid dots, meaning that the young plants adopted direct defences under the poor soil nutritional condition. Under the high soil nutritional condition, in contrast, the plants strongly expressed the indirect defence traits. They produced abundant EFNs and pearl bodies, and attracted many ants.

    "abstract": "The disadvantage of induced defenses compared with constitutive defenses is the time during which a plant is vulnerable to herbivory before activation. There is obvious importance in determining the costs and benefits of induced defenses. Some plants produce extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), which attract ants that protect against herbivores, and induce EFNs and extrafloral nectar in response to leaf damage. To understand induction of indirect defense by ants, we investigated the induction and relaxation of extrafloral nectar secretion and EFN formation after artificial leaf damage in young Mallotus japonicus. Plants were grown under control or leaf damage conditions a greenhouse or in the field. Following artificial leaf damage, we assessed secretion of extrafloral nectar and the number of ant workers on plants. We measured the number of EFNs on each of seven leaves produced after leaf damage. Extrafloral nectar secretion was induced within 1 day following leaf damage, resulting in the attraction of numerous ant workers, and the extrafloral nectar secretion decreased to initial levels after 7 days. The number of EFNs was largest on the first leaf and smallest on the sixth leaf produced after leaf damage, but the total number of EFNs did not differ between treatments. Thus, M. japonicus rapidly induces extrafloral nectar secretion after leaf damage, followed by relaxation. Furthermore, following induction of EFNs on newly produced leaves, it may decrease the cost of induction by reducing the number of EFNs on leaves produced later.          *[The workers of 2 ant species, Pheidole noda Motschoulsky & Nylanderia flavipes Smith, visited the plants during the experiment.

Some EFN-bearing plants possess different types of EFNs, which might have different effects on ants on the plants. Mallotus japonicus (Thunb.) Muell. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae) bears two types of EFNs, including a pair of large EFNs at the leaf base and many small EFNs along the leaf edge. This study aimed to determine the different roles of the two types of EFNs in biotic defense by ants. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of leaf damage on EFN production and on the distribution pattern of ants. After leaf damage, the number of leaf edge EFNs increased in the leaves first-produced. The number of ants on the leaves also increased, and the foraging area of ants extended from the leaf base to the leaf tip. An EFN-covering field experiment revealed that leaf edge EFNs had a greater effect than leaf base EFNs on ant dispersal on leaves. The extended foraging area of ants resulted in an increase of encounter or attack rate against an experimentally placed herbivore, Spodoptera litura. These results suggest that M. japonicus plants control the foraging area of ants on their leaves using different types of EFNs in response to leaf damage, thus achieving a very effective biotic defense against herbivores by ants.",

    "abstract": "1.Most plant species rely upon multiple lines of defence that develop or change functions with leaf age. To date, the effects of leaf age on multiple defence traits have been insufficiently elucidated. For Mallotus japonicus (Euphorbiaceae), we report a shift from direct to indirect defence against herbivory. That shift occurs gradually during leaf ageing.  2.First, the densities of trichomes and pellucid dots, the numbers of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and pearl bodies, and the number of ants on leaves of M. japonicus were examined in the field at weekly intervals. Secondly, herbivore species and the degree of herbivory were examined. Thirdly, the effects of ants on herbivore exclusion were investigated experimentally in the field. Finally, to confirm the effectiveness of trichomes and pellucid dots for defence against two herbivore species [the adult flea beetle, Aphthona strigosa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), and the inchworm, Ascotis selenaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)], both young and middle-aged leaves were tested using laboratory bioassay.  3.On newly emerged leaves, densities of trichomes and pellucid dots were extremely high, but they decreased rapidly with leaf age. The respective quantities of EFNs that were actually secreting nectar, the pearl bodies, and the ants on middle-aged leaves were greater than those on leaves of other ages. On M. japonicus, we found 11 herbivorous insects, among which Ap. strigosa and As. selenaria were the principal herbivores.  4.The damaged leaf areas of ant-excluded plants were much larger than those of control plants. Most herbivory was attributable to As. selenaria. Laboratory bioassay revealed that against Ap. strigosa and small As. selenaria larvae, trichomes and pellucid dots in young leaves functioned well, although those in middle-aged leaves did not.  5.Synthesis. Young M. japonicus leaves are defended against herbivores through the use of direct defence traits such as trichomes and pellucid dots. However, the plant uses indirect defence traits for middle-aged leaves. This shift from direct defence to indirect defence with leaf ageing supports the 'optimal defence theory': plants have evolved multiple defence traits to maximize their fitness.          *[On the 20 plants selected for this experiment, we observed the workers of Pheidole noda, Tetramorium tsushimae, & Camponotus vitiosus on the plants. Pheidole noda workers visited the plants frequently, while visits by T. tsushimae & C. vitiosus workers were few.  The numbers of ants on different age leaves of differed significantly, with more ants on 2 to 6-week-old leaves than on the leaves of other ages.]",

However, these hypotheses have overlooked several factors: the preferential investment by healthy vigorous trees in growth rather than defense against herbivores, variation among aphid species in their responses to bright autumn leaves and plant defenses and the occurrence of tritrophic interactions in tree crowns. I incorporate these factors into a hypothesis that autumn leaf colors signal tree quality to myrmecophilous specialist aphids, with the aphids, in turn, attracting aphid-tending ants during the following spring, and the ants defending the trees from other aphids and herbivores. Therefore, bright autumn leaves may have adaptive significance, attracting myrmecophilous specialist aphids and their attending ants and, thus, reducing herbivory and competition among aphids.",

    "abstract": "Cursorial central\u0010place foragers like ants are expected to minimize travel costs by choosing the least resistive pathways to food resources. Tropical arboreal and semi\u0010arboreal ants locomote over a variety of plant surfaces, and their choice of pathways is selective. We measured the roughness of tree trunk and liana stem surfaces using laser scanning technology, and explored its consequences for running speed in various ant taxa. The average amplitude of tree trunk surface roughness differed interspecifically, and ranged from 1.4-2.2 mm among three common tree species (Anacardium excelsum, Alseis blackiana, and Dipteryx panamensis). The roughness of liana stems also varied interspecifically (among Tontelea ovalifolia, Bauhinia sp. and Paullinia sp.) and was an order of magnitude lower than tree surface roughness (mean amplitude ranged 0.09-0.19 mm). Field observations of various ant species foraging on tree trunks and liana stems, and on dowels covered with sandpaper, showed that their running speed declined with increasing amplitude of roughness. The effect of roughness on running speed was strongest for mid\u0010sized ants (Azteca trigona and Dolichoderus bispinosus). The accumulation rate of ants at baits did not vary with tree surface roughness, but was significantly lower on moss\u0010covered versus moss\u0010free bark. Collectively, these results indicate that the quality of plant substrates can influence the foraging patterns of arboreal ants, but likely is more important for resource discovery than for dominance on bare tree surfaces.",

Phylogenetic trees have demonstrated multiple gains and loss of ant-attendance in the course of aphid-ant interactions, implying that mutualisms easily form and dissolve. Several studies have reported the factors that influence the formation and maintenance of aphid-ant interactions. Examples include the physiological costs of ant attendance, competition for mutualistic ants, ant predation on aphids, the influence of host plants, and parasitoid wasps. Recent physiological techniques have also revealed the chemical component of aphid-ant mutualisms. The honeydew of ant-attended aphids contains melezitose (a trisaccharide), which has an important role in aphid-ant interactions. Studies of cuticular hydrocarbons on aphids and ants have clarified the underlying mechanisms of ant predation on aphids. Attending ants also reduce aphid dispersal ability, causing the formation of fragmented aphid populations with low genetic diversity in each population. The reduced aphid dispersal could be partly explained by higher wing loading and reduction of flight apparatus due to ant attendance. Whether ant attendance is associated with the range of host plants of aphids or genetic variation in microorganism in aphids remain to be explored.",

    "abstract": "*[To examine the specificity of the ant-seed interaction, general food baits & seeds of the ant-garden plant Peperomia macrostachya were offered on alternate days at 108 bait stations.  Seventy ant species were detected at food baits & could have interacted with AG seeds, but only 3 species collected P. macrostachya seeds, with 84% of observed seed removal by ants being attributed to the ant-garden ant Camponotus femoratus.  In a separate experiment, arthropod exclusion significantly reduced AG seed removal rates, but vertebrate exclusion did not.  Thus species specific seed dispersal, rather than post-dispersal processes, appears to be the primary determinant of the distribution of AG plants.  The results also begin to quantify factors that affect seed fate in this unusually specific plant-animal mutualism.  To characterize behavioral cues on AG seeds, solvent extracts of 3 species, Anthurium gracile, Codonanthe uleana, & P. macrostachya,  were subjected to chromatographic fractionation.   To test behavioral activity, each fraction was applied to other seeds that ants ordinarily ignore.   At least one fraction of each seed extract elicited retrieval behavior in C. femoratus, but the active fractions of the 3 species differed in chemical composition, indicating that each plant species elicits seed-carrying with a different class of chemical attractants. Volatile attractants from P. macrostachya were further investigated using Y-tube olfactometer assays & gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection.  In the olfactometer, C. femoratus preferred the odor of P. macrostachya seeds over that of control seeds, & P. macrostachya extract over solvent control.  Five electrophysiologically active phenolic & terpenoid compounds from P. macrostachya extract were identified & combined in a synthetic blend, which was also preferred over solvent control & over a single component alone.  Although seed dispersal by ants is common worldwide, this is the first documentation of volatile attractants from any ant-dispersed seed.  Furthermore, the most abundant component of the attractive blend, geranyl linalool, is toxic to many ant species, hinting at one mechanism by which AG seeds may avoid being collected by inappropriate dispersers.]",

    "abstract": "Throughout lowland Amazonia, arboreal ants collect seeds of specific plants and cultivate them in nutrient-rich nests, forming diverse yet obligate and species-specific symbioses called Neotropical ant-gardens (AGs). The ants depend on their symbiotic plants for nest stability, and the plants depend on AGs for substrate and nutrients. Although the AGs are limited to specific participants, it is unknown at what stage specificity arises, and seed fate pathways in AG epiphytes are undocumented. Here we examine the specificity of the ant-seed interaction by comparing the ant community observed at general food baits to ants attracted to and removing seeds of the AG plant Peperomia macrostachya. We also compare seed removal rates under treatments that excluded vertebrates, arthropods, or both. In the bait study, only three of 70 ant species collected P. macrostachya seeds, and 84% of observed seed removal by ants was attributed to the AG ant Camponotus femoratus.

In this obligate mutualism, ants depend on the plants for nest stability and the plants depend on ant nests for substrate and nutrients. AG ants and plants are abundant, dominant members of lowland Amazonian ecosystems, but the cues ants use to recognize the seeds are poorly understood. To address the chemical basis of the ant-seed interaction, we surveyed seed chemistry in nine AG species and eight non-AG congeners. We detected seven phenolic and terpenoid volatiles common to seeds of all or most of the AG species, but a blend of the shared compounds was not attractive to the AG ant Camponotus femoratus. We also analyzed seeds of three AG species (Anthurium gracile, Codonanthe uleana, and Peperomia macrostachya) using behavior-guided fractionation. At least one chromatographic fraction of each seed extract elicited retrieval behavior in C. femoratus, but the active fractions of the three plant species differed in polarity and chemical composition, indicating that shared compounds alone did not explain seed-carrying behavior. We suggest that the various AG seed species must elicit seed-carrying with different chemical cues.",

    "abstract": "Among invertebrates, only ants have a major role in seed dispersal, and thousands of plant species produce seeds specialized for ant dispersal in \"diffuse\" multispecies interactions. An outstanding but poorly understood ant-seed mutualism occurs in the Amazonian rainforest, where arboreal ants collect seeds of several epiphyte species and cultivate them in nutrient-rich nests, forming abundant and conspicuous hanging gardens known as ant-gardens (AGs). AG ants and plants are dominant members of lowland Amazonian ecosystems, and their interaction is both specific and obligate, but the means by which ants locate, recognize, and accept their mutualist seeds while rejecting other seeds is unknown. Here we address the chemical and behavioral basis of the AG interaction. We show that workers of the AG ant Camponotus femoratus are attracted to odorants emanating from seeds of the AG plant Peperomia macrostachya, and that chemical cues also elicit seed-carrying behavior. We identify five compounds from P. macrostachya seeds that, as a blend, attract C. femoratus workers. This report of attractive odorants from ant-dispersed seeds illustrates the intimacy and complexity of the AG mutualism and begins to illuminate the chemical basis of this important and enigmatic interaction.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation invites cheating, and nowhere is this more apparent than when different species cooperate, known as mutualism. In almost all mutualisms studied, specialist parasites have been identified that purloin the benefits that one mutualist provides another. Explaining how parasites are kept from driving mutualisms extinct remains an unsolved problem because existing theories explaining the maintenance of cooperation do not apply to parasites of mutualisms. Nonetheless, these theories can be summarized in such a way as to suggest how mutualisms can persist in the face of parasites. (1) For cooperation to occur, the recipient of a benefit must reciprocate, and the recriprocated benefit must be captured by the initial giver or its offspring. (2) For cooperation to persist, the mutualism must be re-assembled each generation. Because most mutualisms are of the 'by-product' type, broadly defined, the first condition is normally always fulfilled. Thus, the maintenance of mutualism usually requires enforcement of the second condition: reliable re-assembly. Hence, I argue that the persistence of mutualism is best understood by using theories of species coexistence, because each mutualist can be considered a resource for the other, and species coexistence theory explains how multiple taxa (e.g. parasites and mutualists) can stably partition a resource over multiple generations. This approach connects the study of mutualism to theories of population regulation and helps to identify key factors that have promoted the evolution, maintenance and breakdown of mutualism. I discuss how these ideas might apply to and be tested in ant-plant, fig-wasp and yucca-moth mutualisms.",

    "abstract": "Ecological theory has long supported the idea that species coexistence in a homogeneous habitat is promoted by spatial structure, but empirical evidence for this hypothesis has lagged behind theory. Here we describe a Neotropical ant-plant symbiosis that is ideally suited for testing spatial models of coexistence. Two genera of ants, Allomerus cf. demerarae and three species of Azteca are specialized to live on a single species of ant\u0010plant, Cordia nodosa, in a Western Amazonian tropical rain forest. Empirically, using census data from widely separated localities, we show that the relative colonization abilities of the two ant genera are a function of plant density. A parameterized model shows that this pattern alone is sufficiently robust to explain coexistence in the system. Census and experimental data suggest that Azteca queens are better long\u0010distance flyers, but that Allomerus colonies are more fecund. Thus, Azteca can dominate in areas where host\u0010plant densities are low (and parent colony-sapling distances are long), and Allomerus can dominate in areas where host\u0010plant densities are high. Existing spatial heterogeneity in host\u0010plant densities therefore can allow regional coexistence, and intersite dispersal can produce local mixing. In conclusion, a dispersal-fecundity trade\u0010off appears to allow the two genera to treat spatial heterogeneity in patch density as a niche axis. This study further suggests that a spatially structured approach is essential in understanding the persistence of some mutualisms in the presence of parasites.          *[Myrmelachista colonized <2% of the Cordia host plants.]",

Plants that are involved in an apparent ant-plant mutualism are likely to be impacted by the invasion of this non-native ant. These plants have seeds that bear lipid-rich external appendages (elaiosomes) that serve as attractants to ants. Native seed-dispersing ants consume the elaiosome, but discard the seed intact. As a result, plants benefit from ant-mediated seed dispersal and ants, in exchange, obtain a food reward. We conducted an experiment to determine if elaiosome-bearing seeds handled by fire ants have reduced germination success.  One hundred seeds of the bird's foot violet, Viola pedata, were presented to each of 10 colonies of S. invicta and 10 colonies of a native seed-dispersing ant, Aphaenogaster carolinensis. In addition, we used unhandled seeds as a control. In recovered seeds presented to S. invicta, 14.8% were intact, 17.8% were scarified, and 67.4% were destroyed.  All recovered seeds presented to A. carolinensis were intact. Of the 1000 total seeds presented to S. invicta, less than 2% germinated whereas 14.8% of 1000 total seeds handled by A. carolinenesis germinated. We found that fire ants caused a significant decrease in V. pedata seed germination. In comparison, there was no difference between germination success in seeds handled by A. carolinensis and unhandled seeds. By consuming or damaging seeds, S. invicta might reduce seedling recruitment and thereby affect populations of ant-dispersed plants.

In this work, we used the 15N stable isotope method to study altitudinal variations in the roles of ants in the nutrient transfer of oak (Quercus liaotungensis). Our work shows that ants deliver nitrogen in indirect ant-plant interactions, and that the effect of nutrient transfer differed significantly with altitude. Ants' trophic level at high altitudes was significantly lower than that at low altitudes, indicating that the degree of ant-aphid mutualism was greater at high altitudes, which may be beneficial in nitrogen transfer.

We then evaluated the impacts of ants on small (diameter at breast height (DBH) < 5 cm) and large trees (DBH > 25 cm). The field survey showed that the density of ants on leaves was determined by the density of aphids and the latter was similar among different-sized trees; through an ant-exclusion treatment, we found that the impacts of ants on plants, aphids, caterpillars, and galls did not differ by the size of the tree. L. fuliginosus had a significant protective effect for Q. liaotungensis, but this effect did not convert to enhanced fruit production during the 2-year study period.

    "abstract": "While large herbivores are critically important components of terrestrial ecosystems and can have pronounced top\u0010down effects on plants, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these effects remains incomplete. Large herbivores can alter plant growth, reproduction, and abundance through direct effects (predominantly consumption) and through indirect effects via altered interactions with abiotic factors and other species. We know considerably less about these indirect effects than the direct effects. Here, we integrate medium\u0010 and small\u0010scale field experiments to investigate how a large vertebrate herbivore, cattle (Bos taurus), affects the aboveground biomass of a dominant forb species, Artemisia scoparia, via diverse direct and indirect pathways in a temperate grassland in northeast China. Although cattle consumed this forb, its biomass increased significantly in response to grazing, due to multiple indirect positive effects that outweighed the direct negative effects of consumption. Cattle preferentially consumed the competing grass Leymus chinensis, and altered Artemisia microhabitats by reducing total plant cover and litter biomass and by increasing the abundance of co\u0010occurring ant species (e.g., Formica spp. and Lasius spp.). This led to additional indirect positive effects on A. scoparia likely due to (1) increased light availability in understory layers and other limiting resources (e.g., soil nutrients and moisture) caused by removal of competitors and plant litter at the soil surface and (2) the changes in resource availability (e.g., soil nutrients and moisture) associated with ant colonies. Our results show that large herbivores can affect plant growth not only via direct consumption, but also via multiple indirect effects. Focusing on the causes and consequences of herbivore\u0010induced indirect effects will not only help us to better understand the influence of these animals in ecological systems, but will also lead to more effective land management and conservation practices in the regions they inhabit.",

It is clear that the ant tending level can be affected by the temporal factor, age-specific, the density of the hemipterans, and quantity and quality of honeydew produced by hemipterans.  2. Few studies of ant-hemipteran mutualisms have reported the patterns of host plants-dependent effects, and whether host plants influence the ant tending level that is also unclear. As such, laboratory experiments were conducted to test whether the colony growth rate of an invasive mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley, parasitism of Aenasius bambawalei Hayat, an dominant parasitoid of P. solenopsis, are affected by tending by ghost ants (Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius)], host plants (tomato and cotton), and interactions between the two factors. The difference in the ant tending level between the host plants was also determined.  3. The results showed that mealybug colony growth and parasitism were significantly affected by ant tending and host plant separately. There were significant interactions between the independent factors on the mealybug colony growth rate and percentage parasitism. These results suggest that benefits to mealybugs are host plant-dependent.",

Our investigation focused on the Oecophylla smaragdina which live on Ficus altissma & Ficus benjamina.  We recorded the ant activity in 3 seasons & the position of ant nests on the figtrees.  The results showed that: The pattern of ant activity pattern varied among 3 seasons, & the intensity & the time of activity were the strongest in the rain season, & medium in dry hot season, & weak in cool fog season.  The positions of ant nests were varied, nests were located on the top branches on F. benjamina & the nests were located on the low branches on F. altissma.  The experiment of food preference showed that the O. smaragdina was carnivore.  O. smaragdina preferred to light, & the intensity of activity was obvious stronger in the light than without light.  Figwasps were important food resource for O. smaragdina.  When fig wasps were preyed by O. smaragdina were related with developing stage of figs.  In pre-female floral phase & inter-floral phase, ants prey more non-pollination wasps, so the ants benefit the mutualism.  In the male floral phase, ants prey pollination wasps & have the negative effect on the mutualism.]",

We recorded 22 ant species interacting with diaspores (an estimated 15% of the total species pool in the region).  Species richness & diversity did not differ among successional stages but the behavior of ants towards diaspores changed with the age of secondary forests.  In old successional stages, the removal of entire diaspores was more common than in young successional stages of forests.  Concordantly, diaspore removal rates were lowest in the youngest successional stage of secondary forests & increased with the age of forests.]",
