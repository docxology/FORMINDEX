    "abstract": "Maintaining and updating FORMIS requires the cooperative efforts of myrmecologists throughout the world.  >>Please begin by inspecting citations of your own work for accuracy and completeness<<.  The addition of keywords and/or abstracts would be especially useful.  Please see the next section for instructions about how to contribute or update citations.  AGRICOLA will be searched to keep FORMIS updated; however, this will only find a small portion of the literature.  It is hoped that this database will become a magnet and distribution mechanism for specialty ant bibliographies like the Fire Ant Literature Database.  Specialty bibliographies are needed for genera such as Formica, Camponotus, Myrmica, Pheidole, Monomorium, Messor and Cataglyphis to name a few.  Specialty bibliographies on subjects such as foraging, bioenergetics, myrmecophiles, and ant-plant symbioses would also be useful.  Geographic bibliographies for places like Hawaii, India, Mexico, Brazil, etc. could also be assembled.  Specialty bibliographies can range from a few dozen citations to several thousand; the only requirement is that they be thorough.  New citations could also be added by journal.  Please contact Dr. Porter if you are interested in adding a bibliography to FORMIS.  Users are welcome to create their own customized bibliographies from FORMIS; however, they should be aware that personal modifications to FORMIS will be lost in future updates if they are not sent in for official inclusion.  Also, users who use EndNote to automatically create bibliographies at the end of their papers should be aware that citation numbers in FORMIS will not be consistant from year to year, so a paper started on one database needs to be finished on the same one.",

    "abstract": "Invasive ants are amongst the most destructive and widespread invaders across the globe; they can strongly alter invaded ecosystems and are responsible for the loss of native ant species. Several studies have reported that invasive ants can also lead to substantial economic costs. In this study, we search, describe and analyse 1342 reported costs of invasive ants compiled in the InvaCost database. Economic costs, reported since 1930 for 12 ant species in 27 countries, totalled US$ 51.93 billion, from which US$ 10.95 billion were incurred, and US$ 40.98 billion were potential costs (i.e., expected or predicted costs). More than 80% of total costs were associated with only two species, Solenopsis invicta and Wasmannia auropunctata; and two countries, the USA and Australia. Overall, damage costs amounted to 92% of the total cost, mainly impacting the agriculture, public and social welfare sectors. Management costs were primarily post-invasion management (US$ 1.79 billion), with much lower amounts dedicated to prevention (US$ 235.63 million). Besides the taxonomic bias, cost information was lacking for an average of 78% of the invaded countries. Moreover, even in countries where costs were reported, such information was available for only 56% of the invaded locations. Our synthesis suggests that the global costs of invasive ants are massive but largely biased towards developed economies, with a huge proportion of underreported costs, and thus most likely grossly underestimated. We advocate for more and improved cost reporting of invasive ants through better collaborations between managers, practitioners and researchers, a crucial basis for adequately informing future budgets and improving proactive management actions of invasive ants.",

Impacts were assessed assuming that the government made a minimal effort to abate a RIFA invasion, & that RIFA spread to all potential habitats.  As a result, the economic loss directly caused by RIFA was estimated to be approximately 19,248 million yen per year, including the costs borne by households, agriculture, infrastructure, & recreation facilities, as well as the estimated minimal government intervention expenditure.  The economic value of the outdoor activities foregone by residents & tourists was estimated to be approximately 24,610 million yen per year.  This study estimates the total economic loss caused by RIFA in Okinawa to be approximately 43,858 million yen per year.  Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating the economic impact of RIFA, when considering the necessity of countermeasures & budgeting for a RIFA invasion.  However, further studies are needed to more precisely estimate the cost in Japan, because the current estimate was unable to take into account differences in social systems & customs between Japan and the United States.]",

    "abstract": "Ants intercepted by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture in 2018 and 2019 identified as Solenopsis spp., and possibly S. invicta, were submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service-Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology, Imported Fire Ant and Household Insects Research Unit for further taxonomic assessment using genetic and chemical methods. The 2018 sample consisted of 1 worker ant, and the 2019 sample consisted of 3 worker ants. Thoraces were used for genetic assessment and gasters were used for venom analyses. It was determined readily from genetic and chemical analyses that the intercepted ants were not S. invicta or S. richteri. Mitochondrial COX1 gene sequences were compared with previously published data from Solenopsis species. The closest match for the 2018 sample was S. xyloni, which is native to the shipment's origin (San Diego, California, USA). The 2 major alkaloids found were characteristic of the S. geminata species group. In addition, the alkaloid ratio closely matched that of S. xyloni. Therefore, the alkaloid analysis of the 2018 intercepted ant concurs with the genetic data that the ant was an S. xyloni worker. The COX1 gene sequences of the 2019 interceptions most closely matched S. geminata. The corresponding venom alkaloid profile also eliminated S. invicta and S. richteri as possibilities. However, 1 major alkaloid was unusual (Fig. 2) and normally is found only in trace amounts. We suggest the 2019 specimens are an unusual variant of S. geminata.  This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time and is therefore in the public domain.",

Multivariate analyses of diet content & invertebrates collected at each site suggest that most prey was from the leaf litter.  Non-native ants & amphipods comprised 30% & 22%, respectively, of the total prey items consumed.  These non-native invertebrates were more abundant in stomachs of E. coqui than in the environment indicating a preference for these species.  Dominant prey items in frog stomachs differed among study sites suggesting that frogs are opportunistic feeders & forage on abundant prey items.]",

    "abstract": "*[In Hawaii, pineapple wilt disease is associated with the presence of both mealybugs (Dysmicoccus neobrevipes Beardsley & D. brevipes (Ckll.)) & of ants attending them (mainly Pheidole megacephala (F.)).  In studies in Poamoho (on the island of Oahu) & near the airport on the island of Molokai in 1976-79, the population density of P. megacephala was greater during the 2nd than during the 1st crop at both localities.  At Poamoho, no diseased plants were found in plots where ants had been controled, whereas the number of such plants increased sharply during the 2nd crop in untreated plots.  The incidence of the disease & of the insects was greater at the edges of the plots than in the middle.  The correlation between the number of ants caught in pitfall traps & the percentage of mealybug-infested plants was very high.  At Molokai, P. megacephala began to invade experimental pineapple plots at the edges adjoining abandoned fields & waste areas, taking 2.5 years to infest all the plots.  The highest ant density, with uniform infestation of all plots, occurred about 3 years after planting.  Population growth of both ants & mealybugs appeared to be strongly influenced by the phenology of the pineapple plants during the 1st fruit crop.  A marked reduction in the ant population was probably caused by unusually heavy rainfall in March-April 1979.  In a discussion of pest management strategies for pineapple, bait stakes & insecticide treatment of field margins & adjacent old fields or uncultivated areas are recommended to prevent migration of P. megacephala into pineapple plantations.]",

    "abstract": "*[Ants had been absent from the Hawaiian Islands before their human introduction.  Today they cause severe alterations of ecosystems & displace native biota.  Due to their strong demand on carbohydrate-rich resources, they often exploit floral nectar of native Hawaiian plant species with largely unknown consequences for the plants' reproduction.  We examined effects of flower-visiting invasive ants on reproduction of the endemic shrub Vaccinium reticulatum (Ericaceae) in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park.  Ant densities in flowers were high & floral nectar was excessively exploited, which may lead to a reduced visitation rate of pollinators.  However, the ants presence on flowers strongly reduced flower parasitism by caterpillars of the introduced plume moth Stenoptilodes littoralis & decreased the loss of flowers & buds.  This is the first documented mutualism between invasive ants & an endemic plant species in Hawai'i.  Developed fruits of this partly self-incompatible plant, bore relatively low proportions of viable seeds, irrespective of the experimentally controlled visitor spectrum of the flowers.  This may indicate that ants do not function as pollinators & that effective pollinators are scant or absent.]",

Here it is shown that M. sahlbergi , like M. pharaonis , is found worldwide, almost certainly as a result of introductions. Including quarantine interceptions, this species is recorded from seven global biogeographic regions, but its established outdoor distribution is currently limited to the tropics and subtropics.

    "abstract": "A review is presented of the 13 genera currently taken to constitute the Solenopsis-group, which is redefined here. The genus-group in the sense of this paper includes three former groups, the Monomorium-, Megalomyrmex-, and Solenopsis-groups, combined. Extensive modifications to the genera formerly included in the first of these are proposed, including the new synonymy of Syllophopsis Santschi and Chelaner Emery under Monomorium Mayr, the reinstatement of Phacota Roger and Bondroitia Forel as valid genera, and the exclusion of Hagioxenus Forel from the group. The genera Tranopelta Mayr and Ochetomyrmex Mayr (= Brownidris Kusnezov) are newly excluded from the group and the previous provisional synonym of Monomorium, Xenoaphaenogaster Baroni Urbani, is transferred out of the group and newly synonymized with Pheidole Westwood. One new genus, Epelysidris, is described from Borneo.  The status of Diplorhoptrum Mayr as a separate genus is considered and rejected and a key to recognized genera is presented. Treatment of individual genera varies from a short review of current knowledge to a redefinition and revision of some smaller genera (Anillomyrma Emery, Bondroitia Forel, Diplomorium Mayr). The very large genus Monomorium is reviewed and redefined on a world-wide basis and its extensive genus-level synonymy is discussed in detail. The former genera and subgenera now synonymized with Monomorium are fitted into a system of informal species-groups which are defined and discussed on a world-wide basis. A new name is proposed for the type-species of Monomorium, which is preoccupied, and the authorship and publication date of M. antarcticum (Smith) is investigated. The large Afrotropical fauna of Monomorium is fully revised and keyed, and contains 145 species in 8 species-groups. The latter are keyed separately and only two species- groups are confined to the Afrotropical region. Of the 145 species currently recognized as valid, 46 are described as new in this paper and 35 are newly elevated to species-rank from former infraspecific status; 43 new species-level synonyms are proposed, mostly of former infraspecific forms.",

    "abstract": "The generic classification of the ant subfamily Dorylinae is revised, with the aim of facilitating identification of easily-diagnosable monophyletic genera. The new classification is based on recent molecular phylogenetic evidence and a critical reappraisal of doryline morphology. New keys and diagnoses based on workers and males are provided, along with reviews of natural history and phylogenetic relationships, distribution maps, and a list of valid species for each lineage. Twenty-eight genera (27 extant and 1 extinct) are recognized within the subfamily, an increase from 20 in the previous classification scheme. Species classified in the polyphyletic Cerapachys and Sphinctomyrmex prior to this publication are here distributed among 9 and 3 different genera, respectively. Amyrmex and Asphinctanilloides are synonymized under Leptanilloides and the currently recognized subgenera are synonymized for Dorylus . No tribal classification is proposed for the subfamily, but several apparently monophyletic genus-groups are discussed. Valid generic names recognized here include: Acanthostichus (= Ctenopyga), Aenictogiton, Aenictus (= Paraenictus, Typhlatta), Cerapachys (= Ceratopachys), Cheliomyrmex, Chrysapace gen. rev., Cylindromyrmex (= Holcoponera , Hypocylindromyrmex , Metacylindromyrmex), Dorylus (= Alaopone syn. n., Anomma syn. n., Cosmaecetes, Dichthadia syn. n., Rhogmus syn. n., Shuckardia, Sphecomyrmex, Sphegomyrmex, Typhlopone syn. n.), Eburopone gen. n., Eciton (= Camptognatha, Holopone, Mayromyrmex), Eusphinctus gen. rev., Labidus (= Nycteresia , Pseudodichthadia), Leptanilloides (= Amyrmex syn. n., Asphinctanilloides syn. n.), Lioponera gen. rev.

    "abstract": "Ants are some of the most abundant and ecologically successful terrestrial organisms, and invasive ants rank among the most damaging invasive species. The Argentine ant is a particularly well-studied invader, in part because of the extreme social structure of introduced populations, known as unicoloniality. Unicolonial ants form geographically vast supercolonies, within which territorial behaviour and intraspecific aggression are absent. Because the extreme social structure of introduced populations arises from the widespread acceptance of conspecifics, understanding how this colonymate recognition occurs is key to explaining their success as invaders. Here, we present analyses of Argentine ant recognition cues (cuticular hydrocarbons) and population genetic characteristics from 25 sites across four continents and the Hawaiian Islands. By examining both hydrocarbon profiles and microsatellite genotypes in the same individual ants, we show that native and introduced populations differ in several respects. Both individual workers and groups of nestmates in the introduced range possess less diverse chemical profiles than ants in the native range. As previous studies have reported, we also find that introduced populations possess much lower levels of genetic diversity than populations in the native range. Interestingly, the largest supercolonies on several continents are strikingly similar to each other, suggesting that they arose from a shared introduction pathway. This high similarity suggests that these geographically far-flung ants may still recognize and accept each other as colonymates, thus representing distant nodes of a single, widely distributed supercolony. These findings shed light on the behaviour and sociality of these unicolonial invaders, and pose new questions about the history and origins of introduced populations.",

DWV and other bee-associated RNA viruses are generalists capable of infecting diverse hosts. Here, we used RNAseq analysis to test the hypothesis that due to the frequency of interactions, a range of apiary pest species would become infected with DWV and/or other honey bee-associated viruses. We confirmed that DWV-A was the most prevalent virus in the apiary, with genetically similar sequences circulating in the apiary pests, suggesting frequent inter-species transmission. In addition, different proportions of the three DWV master variants as indicated by BLAST analysis and genome coverage plots revealed interesting DWV-species groupings. We also observed that new genomic recombinants were formed by the DWV master variants, which are likely adapted to replicate in different host species. Species groupings also applied when considering other viruses, many of which were widespread in the apiaries. In social wasps, samples were grouped further by site, which potentially also influenced viral load. Thus, the apiary invertebrate community has the potential to act as reservoirs of honey bee-associated viruses, highlighting the importance of considering the wider community in the apiary when considering honey bee health.",

    "abstract": "The global spread of a parasitic mite (Varroa destructor) has resulted in Deformed wing virus (DWV), a previously rare pathogen, now dominating the viromes in honey bees and contributing to large-scale honey bee colony losses. DWV can be found in diverse insect taxa and has been implicated in spilling over from honey bees into associated (\u001capiary\u001d) and other (\u001cnon-apiary\u001d) insects. Here we generated next generation sequence data from 127 insect samples belonging to diverse taxa collected from Hawaiian islands with and without Varroa to identify whether the mite has indirectly affected the viral landscapes of key insect taxa across bees, wasps, flies and ants. Our data showed that, while Varroa was associated with a dramatic increase in abundance of (predominantly recombinant) DWV in honey bees (and no other honey bee-associated RNA virus), this change was not seen in any other taxa sampled. Honey bees share their environment with other insect populations and exist as a homogenous group, frequently sharing common viruses, albeit at low levels. Our data suggest that the threat of Varroa to increase viral load in an apiary does not automatically translate to an increase in virus load in other insects living in the wider community.          *[NOTE: This identification needs to be confirmed.  Hawaii would be a significant range extension for Formica.]",

    "abstract": "The Imported Fire Ant (IFA) Quarantine is administered by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The goal of the Federal Quarantine is to prevent the artificial spread of IFA.  Although IFA have currently become established in 13 States and in Puerto Rico, many other regions and States in the Continental U.S. and in Hawaii have conditions where new IFA infestations could survive.   The IFA Federal Quarantine was established in 1958.  The quarantine began as a cooperative eradication program in 9 States (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina, and Texas).  When converted to today's dollar amounts, the initial funding for the quarantine was about $17 million.  As several insecticides were developed and shown to be effective against IFA, funding for the quarantine reached $37 million in 1971.  However, environmental and human health concerns eventually led to those insecticides being banned from use in 1977.  Congressional support then waned until 2000 when only $113,000 was appropriated for the IFA Quarantine.  Through the efforts of the National Plant Board, the nursery industry, and the public in uninfested states, funding for the IFA Quarantine was restored in 2001 and is currently just over $2 million.  These funds are primarily used to regulate articles that pose a risk of spreading IFA to uninfested areas and for surveys to determine the extent of IFA spread.  Among the articles specifically regulated in 7 CFR 301.81 (Code of Federal Regulations) are the movement of soil, baled hay and straw, plants and sod with roots and soil attached, soil moving equipment, and any other article that presents a risk of spreading IFA.   Information on the IFA Quarantine can be found at: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/ispmlfireantslindex.html          Another aspect of the IFA Quarantine is the phorid fly release program that involves APHIS, the Agricultural Research Service, and the Florida Department of Plant Industry, IFA-infested states, and universities.  This program is responsible for the rearing and releases of Pseudacteon tricuspis and Psuedacteon curvatus at 39 sites within the IFA Quarantine area.  Of the 27 releases done in 2002-2003 there have been 8 sites where overwintering has been observed.  Further information on phorid fly releases can be found at: http://www.cphst.org/sections/SIPS/.

    "abstract": "1. Ants establish mutualistic interactions involving a wide range of protective relationships (myrmecophily), in which they provide defence against enemies and partners provide food rewards and/or refuge. Although similar in the general outcome, myrmecophilic interactions differ in some characteristics such as quantity and quality of rewards offered by partners which may lead to different specialisation levels and, consequently, to different network properties. 2. The aim of this study was to identify structural patterns in myrmecophilic interaction networks, focusing on aspects related to specialisation: network modularity, nestedness and taxonomic relatedness of interaction ranges. To achieve this, a database of networks was compiled, including the following interactions: ants and domatia-bearing plants (myrmecophytes); ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants (EFNs); ants and floral nectary-bearing plants (FNs); ants and Lepidoptera caterpillars; and ants and Hemiptera. 3. Myrmecophilic networks differed in their topology, with ant-myrmecophyte and ant-Lepidoptera networks being similar in their structural properties. A continuum was found, ranging from highly modular networks and phylogenetically structured interaction ranges in ant-myrmecophyte followed by ant-Lepidoptera networks to low modularity and taxonomically unrelated interaction ranges in ant-Hemiptera, EFN and FN networks. 4. These results suggest that different network topologies may be found across communities of species with similar interaction types, but also, that similar network topologies can be achieved through different mechanisms such as those between ants and myrmecophytes or Lepidoptera larvae. This study contributes to a generalisation of myrmecophilic network patterns and a better understanding of the relationship between specialisation and network topology.",

    "abstract": "The Little Fire Ant (LFA), Wasmannia auropunctata, is native to South and Central America and has spread fairly recently around the Pacific. It is now a serious pest in archipelagos such as Hawaii and Galapagos, where infestations are disrupting agricultural practices and threatening wildlife. In October 2008, SABCL started a program to find natural enemies for their potential use in both archipelagos. Three field surveys were conducted in northern Argentina to search for LFA and natural enemies. Surveys were focused in three types of natural forests: 1) Yungas (little modified low mountain forest) in northwestern Argentina, 2) Paranaense (Atlantic semi-evergreen moist forest) in northeastern Argentina and 3) Chaco/Espinal (mostly gallery forest) in central northern Argentina. A total of 665 samples of ants were obtained using sieves (6 per site) and baits (14 per site); 146 plots (0.25-m2) were sampled: 55 in Yungas, 46 in Paranaense, and 45 in Chaco/Espinal. The leaf litter of each plot was collected and sieved (1x1 cm) to a white plastic tray. Ants were collected with forceps and kept in 96% alcohol for their identification. Baits (1-2g of canned tuna on paper cards) were exposed for 45 min. In each site, baits were placed on the ground every 10-20m along a 200-m transect. Ants were attracted to a total of 519 baits: 164 in Yungas, 172 in Chaco/Espinal, and 183 baits in Paranaense A total of 98 species was found in the Paranaense, 67 in Chaco/Espinal, and 55 in the Yungas; however, the mean number of species per sample was similar in the 3 regions. Wasmannia auropunctata was found up to 34\u222b13\u00a5 south latitude and between 45 and 750 m of altitude. The presence of the LFA was 3 times higher in the Chaco/Espinal, occurring in 8 (72.7%) of the 11 sites. The LFA was 3-5 times more abundant in the Chaco/Espinal, being found in 25 (11.4%) of the 220 samples. Other Wasmannia spp. occurred with LFA: 1) Wasmannia sp. 1 was found for the first time in Argentina in the Chaco/Espinal. This non-described species is similar to that reported by Alex Wild (Wasmannia cf. alw01) for Paraguay; 2) Wasmannia sulcaticeps was found in the Yungas at 690-750 m of altitude; it cooccurred with W. auropunctata only in Calilegua at 750 m of altitude; 3) Wasmannia cf. rochai was found also for the first time in Argentina in the Paranaense at 192-243 m of altitude, but it did not co-occur with the LFA. So far, natural enemies were not found. Alarm pheromones are being used to improve the search of LFA colonies in the field.

    "abstract": "Irradiation is a postharvest quarantine treatment option to control ants and other hitchhiker pests on fresh horticultural products exported from Hawaii. The radiotolerance of the invasive little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), was studied to determine a dose sufficient for its control. Queens from each of five laboratory microcolonies started from five geographic locations in Argentina were irradiated at 20, 50, 70, or 100 Gy or left untreated as controls and then followed for 13 wk to observe colony growth. In general, queen survivorship, and the number of eggs, larvae, and pupae observed in the microcolonies decreased with increasing irradiation dose. In the 50-, 70-, and 100-Gy treatments, the number of eggs observed was reduced by 68, 66, and 76%, respectively, compared with untreated control microcolonies. The number of larvae in the 50-, 70-, and, 100-Gy treatments was reduced by 99.6%, and only one pupa was observed in the 50-Gy treatment and none in the 70- and 100-Gy treatments during the 13-wk experiment. Queens in the 100-Gy treatment had significantly reduced longevity compared with queens in the other treatments. Radiation doses e70 Gy stopped reproduction in W. auropunctata queens and should be sufficient as a phytosanitary treatment. Information from additional invasive ants in Myrmicinae and other subfamilies is needed before recommending a generic irradiation treatment for ants.

LFA can develop fully functional nests on the ground and arboreally, and their foraging and retrieval of food resources is facilitated by a well-developed recruitment system. LFA were found to form recruitment trails on epiphytic moss growing on macadamia nut trees. As a first step to identify LFA recruitment pheromone components, we tested the LFA worker trail-following response to naturally marked epiphytic moss trails. Significantly more LFA workers placed on a natural trail followed the trail and made 90\u221e turns to continue following the trail compared to when they were placed on a fake trail that had no trail marking substance(s). In laboratory choice assays using hexane extracts of moss with and without LFA trail, LFA workers preferred to follow a trail drawn with a hexane extract of moss that had a recruitment trail over a trail drawn with a hexane extract of moss only. Our results confirm that LFA workers readily follow a trail marking substance(s) laid down on epiphytic moss.

The presence of wet food, water, & CO2 within the polyethylene tubing increased chewing & digging activity.  Tubings that are either buried or in constant darkness had more ant damage than those placed on the soil or subjected to constant light.  Increasing temperatures (20-35 degreesC) caused an increase in damage to the tubing.  Damage was less on tubings that had orifices constructed by mechanical means, than those in which heat (hot needle or laser beam) was used.  Rubber materials were more ant resistant than plastics.  Damage was significantly reduced by coating the tubing with 1.0% solutions of tributyltin chloride, tributyltin oxide, & 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Juglone).]",

    "abstract": "*[We studied different biological, genetic, & behavioral aspects of Wasmannia auropunctata within its native southernmost distribution limit, in order to understand which factors are responsible for its success & analyze whether its evolutionary history agrees with the recent introduction into the Mediterranean.  We examined whether the populations in this region have invasive characteristics, studying the association between their dominance & the habitat disturbance, the reproductive system, using microsatellite markers, & the social organization, through aggression tests.  We analyzed mitochondrial & nuclear DNA markers, to perform a phylogeographic analysis in order to infer its dispersion & genetic differentiation history.  Through ecological niche modelling, we identified central & marginal distribution areas, analyzing how they changed over the Quaternary.  We analyzed its competitive ability in a local assembly, using baits & pitfall traps.  Wasmannia auropunctata was widespread at the southernmost limit of its native distribution range, with higher abundances being mainly recorded in anthropic habitats.  The social organization was mainly supercolonial in all habitat types.  The reproductive system was mainly clonal in anthropic habitats, mixed in partially disturbed sites & floodplains, & sexual in natural sites.  The genetic analysis corroborated the existence of 2 main clades (A & B), as had been proposed in other works.  Phylogeographical Bayesian analysis suggested that the common ancestor of both clades would have existed in central Brazil about 3.9 million years ago, from where clade A would have expanded & differentiated northward, & clade B (the same that invaded the Mediterranean) southward.  Ecological niche modelling suggested that genetic differentiation could be accompanied by a differentiation in the ecological niche requirements, clade A being a tropical lineage & clade B a subtropical & temperate lineage.  Clade B was the only one which reached high latitudes in southern South America, which is characterized by colder temperatures than the north of the continent.  This agrees with the subsequent establishment in the Mediterranean region.  Wasmannia auropunctata had a low competitive ability, indicating that interspecific competition is not a factor associated with its success.  Taken together, our results suggest that naturally disturbed environments (such as floodplains) may have played an important role in the appearance of features such as clonality & supercoloniality, which would have later favored W. auropunctata in anthropic habitats, a key to its dispersal outside its native range.  Additionally, the natural expansion at high latitudes to the South of South America, would have allowed it to adapt to colder climates & seasonality, key to its later establishment in the Mediterranean region.]",

    "abstract": "*[The Puerto Rican coqui frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, was introduced to Hawaii in the late 1980s via the commercial horticulture trade.  The objective of this research was to determine whether coqui invasions change invertebrate communities at the landscape scale across the island of Hawaii.  At each invasion front, we measured environmental variability on either side of the front & removed sites that were too variable across the front to ensure that the impacts we measured were the result of the invasion.  After doing this, there remained 15 sites for which we compared invertebrate communities in 30 m x 30 m plots situated on either side of coqui invasion fronts.  In each plot, we collected invertebrate samples from 3 invertebrate communities, the leaf litter, foliage, and flying invertebrate communities.  Multivariate analyses show that coqui frogs change leaf litter communities, by reducing microbivore & herbivore abundances.  Coqui also change flying community composition, but have no measurable effect on foliage communities.  Across sites, we found that coquis reduced the number of leaf litter invertebrates by 27%.  We also found that coquis increased the abundance of flying Diptera by 19% across sites.  We suggest that the leaf litter community is altered through direct coqui predation and that Diptera increase because of increased frog carcasses & excrement in invaded plots.]",

Our analyses revealed that in these clades, diaspore dispersal by ants evolved at least 13 times, 5 times in the Late Miocene& Pliocene in Australasia & 7 times during the Pliocene in SE Asia, after Philidris ants had arrived there, with subsequent dispersal between these 2 areas.  A uniquely specialized ant-garden system evolved in Fiji at the onset of the Quaternary.  The farming in the same ant-gardens of epiphytes that do not offer nest spaces suggests that a broadening of the ants' plant host spectrum drove the evolution of additional domatium-bearing ant-garden-epiphytes by selecting on pre-adapted morphological traits. Consistent with this, we found a statistical correlation between the evolution of diaspore dispersal by ants & domatia in all 3 lineages.]",

    "abstract": "We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine Manduca blackburni, the Blackburn's sphinx moth, to be an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).  Historically, this species occurred on the Hawaiian islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii, but until recently, was known only from one population on Maui.  Researchers observed a second population on Maui in 1992, and populations are now known to also occur on the islands of Kahoolawe and Hawaii.  This moth is currently threatened by one or more of the following: habitat fragmentation and destruction due to development and agricultural practices resulting in the loss of its host plants, habitat degradation due to the effects of introduced animals and plants, predation, parasitism, competition for food or space by alien insects, and overcollection by private and commercial collectors.  Due to its restricted distribution, this species is also vulnerable to extinction from random, catastrophic events, such as drought or fire.  This final rule implements the Federal protections provided by the Act for this moth.   Ants are not a natural component of Hawaii's arthropod fauna, and native species evolved in the absence of predation pressure from ants.  Ants can be particularly destructive predators because of their high densities, recruitment behavior, aggressiveness, and broad range of diet.  Because they are often generalist feeders, ants may affect prey populations independent of prey density, and may locate and destroy isolated individuals and populations. At least 36 species of ants have become established in the Hawaiian Islands, and 3 particularly aggressive species have severely affected the native insect fauna.

    "abstract": "Ants that resemble Camponotus maculatus (Fabricius, 1782) present an opportunity to test the hypothesis that the origin of the Pacific island fauna was primarily New Guinea, the Philippines, and the Indo-Malay archipelago (collectively known as Malesia). We sequenced two mitochondrial and four nuclear markers from 146 specimens from Pacific islands, Australia, and Malesia. We also added 211 specimens representing a larger worldwide sample and performed a series of phylogenetic analyses and ancestral area reconstructions. Results indicate that the Pacific members of this group comprise several robust clades that have distinctly different biogeographical histories, and they suggest an important role for Australia as a source of Pacific colonizations. Malesian areas were recovered mostly in derived positions, and one lineage appears to be Neotropical. Phylogenetic hypotheses indicate that the orange, pan-Pacific form commonly identified as C. chloroticus Emery 1897 actually consists of two distantly related lineages. Also, the lineage on Hawai'i, which has been called C. variegatus (Smith, 1858), appears to be closely related to C. tortuganus Emery, 1895 in Florida and other lineages in the New World. In Micronesia and Polynesia the C. chloroticus-like species support predictions of the taxon-cycle hypothesis and could be candidates for human-mediated dispersal.",

    "abstract": "The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the intramural research agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) which employs scientists to conduct basic and applied research for the development and transfer of solution to agricultural problems of high national priority and to ensure food security for domestic and export needs.  Economically important and invasive arthropods, especially insect, tick, and mite species, negatively impact the health of every plant and animal, resulting in significant production losses among crop, livestock and forestry commodities amounting to billions of US dollars annually.  The economic impact increases further when the insect damage to home and urban landscapes is taken into account.  Ensuring continued viability of beneficial insects in the environment is crucial for the pollination of all horticultural and orchard crops, as well as for enhancing natural biological control of pest arthropods and overall ecosystem sustainability.  Mitigating damage by arthropod pest species and safeguarding the health of beneficial arthropods are key components for ensuring the stability of agricultural production in the United States and abroad.  Developments in genomics, including next generation sequencing (NGS), provide a suite of new research tools within applied agricultural arthropod research.  Contributions by the ARS to arthropod genomics research are reviewed herein.  These  research approaches are discussed briefly in the context of improving agricultural production and environmental stewardship.  Arthropod genomics research within ARS is contributing significantly to the improvement of agricultural production and environmental stewardship for farmers, the agricultural industry, and consumers alike.

    "abstract": "Human-caused biological invasions by an alien species are a worldwide phenomenon. They are particularly significant on isolated oceanic islands and represent a serious threat to endemic biota. The Argentine ant (Iridomyrmex humilis) has become established in portions of the high-elevation shrubland of Haleakala National Park, Maui, Hawaii, over the past 25 yr. This ecosystem lacks native ants but possesses many locally endemic and rare anthropod species. Pitfall trapping and under-rock surveys were conducted to determine the effects of I. humilis on the local arthropod fauna. More than 180 taxa were sampled, mostly Arthropoda. Presence of the Argentine ant is associated with reduced populations of many native and non-native anthropod species, including important predator species and major pollinators of native plants. Effects of ant invasion were particularly severe at higher elevations of Haleakala volcano where endemic species normally exist at low densities. Some taxa, primarily alien species, were more abundant in the presence of ants. Invasion of the Argentine ant has locally reduced the abundance of many endemic species in the shrubland ecosystem. Although the spread of this ant species is slow, I. humilis appears to have the potential to invade a much larger area of Haleakala National Park than it now occupies. Active management of Argentine ant populations will be necessary if the endemic fauna is to be preserved.",

    "abstract": "The little fire ant (LFA), Wasmannia auropunctata, is a serious invasive pest first reported on Hawaii Island in 1999, and has since spread and established itself across the island. LFA is considered one of the worst 100 invasive species and has significant ecological, agricultural, and public health impacts in invaded areas, which include much of the tropical New World. Although localized eradication efforts have proven successful, they are intensive and difficult to implement. Furthermore, LFA's high invasive-ability resists these control efforts in areas where the species is established and can re-infest treated areas. This research set out to determine whether LFA queens have a suppressant effect on new queen production in nests, as a first step in identifying a potential queen pheromone for LFA. A queen pheromone could offer a means to shutdown LFA reproductive capability, potentially by suppressing the production of new queens or inducing the execution of queens or queen-destined larvae. When queenless experimental nests and polygyne experimental nests were compared, six out of eight queenless nests successfully reared both new alate queens (2.25 queens/nest) and drones (3.63 drones/nest) to adulthood, whereas only three of eight polygyne nests reared sexual larvae that failed to develop to adulthood or even the pupal stage. These results suggest that dealate mature LFA queens suppress the production of new alate queens in LFA nests, and is the first evidence that LFA may utilize a queen pheromone.

    "abstract": "*[Ants are very common in banana fields and virtually impossible to control.  The problem posed by ants is their intimate relationship with the banana aphids.  Ants feed on the honeydew secreted by the banana aphids & protect the aphids from their natural enemies.  This results in larger aphid populations & increases the probability of disease spread by the aphids (banana bunchy top virus = BBTV).  The long-legged ant has been recently reported as pest on bananas.  In addition to moving aphids around within a planting (thus contributing to the spread of BBTV), the long-legged ant inadvertently damages the surface of the banana fruit by releasing a toxic chemical when threatened, causing dry necrotic lesions on the fruit surface & reducing marketability.  Long-legged ants are found on all islands & prefer wet, high rainfall areas.  During the 'warm' months of June through October, the ant colonies increase in size & can be quite extensive.  A single colony in Waimanalo on the island of Oahu has been reported to span underground over 2 miles.  Long-legged ants are sugar lovers & are not controlled by the hydramethylnon products, which are formulated with a protein bait attractive to other ant species.  Control of this pest is critical during fruit production.   Big headed ant is also implicated in movement of other honeydew producing insects such as scales & whiteflies & indirectly contributes to quarantine problems for export fruit.  Big headed ant is located on all islands & all growing regions, but is especially intense in abandoned pineapple fields.  Numbers of big headed ants increase during the 'dry' season from May through October.]",

    "abstract": "Two detection methods for the little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), both employing the pheromone attractant 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine (2-MeBu-diMePy), were compared with peanut butter based detection, in order to evaluate differences in species specificity and detection reliability. Trapping was conducted using a transect through a macadamia orchard on the island of Hawaii. The transect consisted of a series of three-tree plots, each plot contained a peanut butter coated stick (the most common detection method used for W. auropunctata in Hawaii), a one-way trap treated with 2-MeBu-diMePy, and a piece of double-sided tape treated with 2-MeBu-diMePy. While there were no differences in the number of W. auropunctata counted with each detection method, and no differences in detection reliability (detecting the known presence of W. auropunctata in a plot), the pheromone-incorporating methods showed greater species specificity, retaining W. auropunctata almost exclusively. These results demonstrate the potential of pheromone-detection methods to selectively capture target ant species even when other ants are present and abundant. Combined data from all three detection methods and a previous visual survey along the transect showed a marked difference in the frequency of cohabitation among ant species. Of the 10 ant species collected, W. auropunctata was found as the sole ant species on a given tree at a significantly higher frequency than all other ant species except Pheidole fervens. 94% percent of the trees with W. auropunctata had only W. auropunctata, supporting previous observations that this species tends to displace other ant species. In addition, W. auropunctata microhabitat preferences were investigated using one-way traps containing 2-MeBu-diMePy, which were placed in three arboreal and three non-arboreal locations.

    "abstract": "AIM: The fundamental biogeographical processes of colonization, speciation and extinction shape island biotas in space-time. On oceanic islands, area and isolation affect these processes and resulting biodiversity patterns. In the Anthropocene, a new human\u0010mediated colonization dynamic is altering insular ecosystems world\u0010wide. Here, we test predictions about the roles of archipelago area and isolation in structuring ant diversity patterns through effects on both natural and anthropogenic biogeographical processes. LOCATION: Tropical Pacific islands. METHODS: We compiled a comprehensive data set of ant faunal compositions across tropical Pacific archipelagos. Using regression analysis we evaluated the bivariate and interactive effects of area and isolation on the number of colonizing lineages, native species, endemic species, exotic species and total richness in the archipelago. RESULTS: There is a strong species-area effect and a much more modest isolation effect on total ant species richness across the Pacific archipelagos. The number of colonizing lineages of each archipelago is strongly driven by the isolation of the archipelago. Endemic species are present in large archipelagos of low and intermediate isolation. The most remote archipelagos are nearly devoid of endemic lineages and their ant faunas are largely composed of Pacific Tramp species and exotics brought from outside the Pacific region. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The prominent species-area curve in Pacific ants emerged over time through multiple processes. The colonization of lineages is determined primarily by isolation, with few or no lineages reaching remote archipelagos. Cladogenesis mediates the isolation effect and increases the area effect through the differential radiation of lineages in large archipelagos. In the Anthropocene, the assembly of the species-area relationship has accelerated dramatically through human\u0010mediated colonization. Overall, our results support a view that species-area curves reflect regulating limits on species richness that scale with area, but that multiple biogeographical processes can occur to achieve these limits.",

    "abstract": "Eastern redcedars (Juniperus virginiana L.) are an abundant renewable resource and represent a potential source of valuable natural products that may serve as natural biocides. The aromatic wood can be extracted to obtain cedarwood oil (CWO) and critical carbon dioxide (CO2) extraction of eastern redcedars gives both high yields and high quality CWO. In this study, CO2-derived CWO and cedrol, the most abundant component of CWO, were field-tested for repellency against the little fire ant (LFA), Wasmannia auropunctata Roger, in a Hawaiian macadamia orchard. Field tests were conducted using chopsticks baited with peanut-butter placed in established LFA trails on macadamia tree trunks and branches. The chopsticks and any ants present were collected after ca. 24 hours and the number of ants determined by visual counting. Four treatments were compared: Hexane only control; mineral oil; CWO; and cedrol. Control chopsticks and chopsticks treated with mineral oil had very high numbers of ants and were statistically equivalent. The CWO-treated chopsticks had significantly fewer LFAs than all the other treatments. Chopsticks treated with cedrol had fewer ants than the control chopsticks but more than the chopsticks treated with CWO. This research suggests that CWO extracts from J. virginianna may provide a renewable source of a natural ant repellent and could help manage this invasive pest.

    "abstract": "We review the relevant literature on ant-carrion interactions, highlight what is known about ants in decomposition ecology, and present a framework for future studies that aim to quantify the direct and indirect effects of ants on decomposition. One hundred and fifty-four species of ants were documented on carrion. Ants were associated with carrion in a wide range of habitats on almost every continent. Ants directly affected decomposition by feeding on carcasses (necrophagy) and by lacerating carcasses. Ants indirectly affected decomposition by predating carrion-feeding invertebrates and by altering the microhabitat of carrion via nest and mound construction. Ants may profoundly impact forensic science primarily by altering the colonization or utilization of carrion by other carrion feeders. Despite the near ubiquity of ants on carrion, their role in decomposition ecology is vastly understudied. Future studies need to experimentally assess the direct and indirect effects of ants on decomposition and comparative studies of different ant species in varying environmental conditions would be particularly fruitful.          *[Brachymyrmex heeri misspelled Brachymyrmex beeri; Gnamptogenys haenschi misspelled Gnamptogenys baenschi; Gnamptogenys striatula misspelled Gnamptogenys triatula; Messor barbarus misspelled Messor barbarous; Odontomachus haematodus misspelled Odontomachus baematodus; Prenolepis imparis misspelled Prenolepis impairs.]          *[Myrmicaria sennaarensis is not a valid name, original publication uses Myremecaria senaarensis; probably this is Pachycondyla sennaarensis = Brachyponera sennaarensis.]",

Odontomachus haemotodus (Linnaeus, 1758), misid. = Odontomachus simillimus (Smith, 1858).  Quadristruma emmae (Emery, 1890) = Strumigenys emmae (Emery, 1890).    One of the most commonly collected groups during this survey were ants. They not only were tops in numbers of specimens, but also had the highest species-diversity per family for any arthropod known from Pagan.  Previous to this study, 18 species of ants were known from Pagan, mainly all widespread species.  During this survey, we identified 25 species including 10 new island records, bringing the total known number of ants from Pagan to 28.  None of these species are endemic to the island & only a few may be native, the remainder are alien introductions.  Probably the most prevalent arthropod in the survey is the crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes.  No supercolonies were observed on Pagan; however, the high levels of abundance of the ants in pitfall and pan traps may be an indicator that this species may eventually form a supercolony on Pagan.  The rare & unusual Myrmecophilus leei Kistner & Chong, 2007 (Orthoptera: Myrmecophilidae) is an inquiline in ant nests.  It was found associated with Anoplolepis on the S portion of Pagan & is the first record of this family from the island.]",

    "abstract": "The Greenhouse Frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) is one of the most widespread frog species in the world. Because of its high population densities, widespread distribution, and consumption of native invertebrates in some invaded sites, understanding its impacts in Hawaii is important. We analyzed stomach contents of 397 frogs from 10 study sites in Maui. Results suggest Greenhouse Frogs are active, ant-specialist predators in the leaf litter. Ants (Formicidae) were the dominant prey flushed from stomachs in both number and volume. Furthermore, only ants were consumed in a higher proportion than they were sampled in the environment. Because ants dominated their diets, and because all ants are nonnative to Hawaii, this means Greenhouse Frogs consumed primarily nonnative invertebrates (>80%) in the areas sampled. Although results suggest that most native taxa are not at risk from Greenhouse Frog predation, the only locations where we could currently find Greenhouse Frogs were in human-dominated lowlands, which have a lower proportion of native species. Greenhouse Frogs may consume more native species if they invade more native-dominated habitat. Alternatively, nonnative ants are known to impact negatively many native invertebrates in Hawaii, and their possible reduction through Greenhouse Frog predation could affect other species positively. Our research highlights the need to understand better the effects of Greenhouse Frog predation on both native and nonnative invertebrates in Hawaii.

    "abstract": "Most documented declines of tropical reptiles are of dramatic or enigmatic species. Declines of widespread species tend to be cryptic. The early (1900s) decline and extinction of the common Pacific skink Emoia impar from the Hawaiian Islands is documented here through an assessment of literature, museum vouchers and recent fieldwork. This decline appears contemporaneous with the documented declines of invertebrates and birds across the Hawaiian Islands. A review of the plausible causal factors indicates that the spread of the introduced big-headed ant Pheidole megacephala is the most likely factor in this lizard decline. The introduction and spread of a similar skink Lampropholis delicata across the islands appears to temporally follow the decline of E. impar, although there is no evidence of competition between these species. It appears that L. delicata is spreading to occupy the niche vacated by the extirpated E. impar. Further confusion exists because the skink E. cyanura, which is very similar in appearance to E. impar, appears to have been introduced to one site within a hotel on Kaua'i and persisted as a population at that site for approximately 2 decades (1970s-1990s) but is now also extirpated. This study highlights the cryptic nature of this early species extinction as evidence that current biogeographical patterns of non-charismatic or enigmatic reptiles across the Pacific may be the historical result of early widespread invasion by ants. Conservation and restoration activities for reptiles in the tropical Pacific should consider this possibility and evaluate all evidence prior to any implementation.",

We also demonstrate the overwhelming occurrence of male & female clonality in introduced populations of W. auropunctata, & suggest that this particular reproduction system is under selection in human-modified habitats.  Together with previous researches focused on native populations, our results suggest that invasive clonal populations may have evolved within human modified habitats in the native range, spreading further from there.  The evolutionarily most parsimonious scenario for the emergence of invasive populations of the little fire ant might thus be a 2-step process.

    "abstract": "*[The recently described species, Cardiocondyla pirata, was collected on the Philippines on a rock in a shady forest stream bed.  Colonies of C. pirata are polygynous & presumably contain only one ergatoid fighter male that kills other eclosing males.  This species shows a unique coloration pattern with translucent body parts & a black eye stripe.  Cardiocondyla venustula males show a new, intermediate reproductive tactic, standing phylogenetically between the species group of tolerant males & a clade of species with fighting males.  Based on the seasonal production of sexuals, one male cannot execute all rivals & mate with all eclosing females.  Therefore, males establish territories that they defend against other males & are able to mate with virgin queens inside their area.  In crossing experiments, inbred Cardiocondyla cf. kagutsuchi queens (that mated with a brother) succeeded more frequently in colony foundings & had a slightly higher lifespan than outbred queens that mated with an unrelated male.  This may be founded on the good fit of genomes of the mating partners & the close coevolution of the mates which lead to highly adapted seminal fluid proteins that favor a long life of the queen.  In inbred Cardiocondyla cf. kagutsuchi colonies, more fecund queens also lived longer which supports the assumption that there is no trade off between fecundity & lifespan in social insects.  The most minimalistic requirement of a colony founding was observed in Cardiocondyla \"argyrotricha\", a monogynous species of Southeast Asia.  Virgin queens are able to found a new colony alone, only accompanied by some workers.  After the first son has eclosed out of the laid haploid eggs, the queen mates with him & starts to lay diploid eggs.  In Cardiocondyla cf. kagutsuchi, there is also a strong heritable component concerning sex ratio.  Established daughter colonies from 2 colonies, that showed a great difference in the amount of male & female sexuals produced, exhibited the same discrepancy in sexual production as did their mother colonies.  However the number of diploid versus haploid larvae did not differ significantly.  Instead the likelihood of diploid larvae to become a queen or a worker varied, which means that determination of female caste has a strong genetic or maternal component in C. cf. kagutsuchi.]",

Winged males have been lost convergently in several clades, and in at least one of them, wingless males have evolved mutual tolerance. To better understand the evolutionary pathways of reproductive tactics, we investigated Cardiocondyla venustula, a species, which in a phylogenetic analysis clusters with species with fighting and species with mutually tolerant, wingless males. Wingless males of C. venustula use their strong mandibles to kill freshly eclosed rival males and also engage in short fights with other adult males, but in addition show a novel behavior hitherto not reported from social insect males: they spread out in the natal nest and defend \"territories\" against other males. Ant males therefore show a much larger variety of reproductive tactics than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "*[Studies on sex ratios in social insects provide among the most compelling evidence for the importance of kin selection in social evolution. The elegant synthesis of Fisher's sex ratio principle and Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory predicts that colony-level sex ratios vary with the colonies' social and genetic structures. Numerous empirical studies in ants, bees, and wasps have corroborated these predictions. However, the evolutionary optimization of sex ratios requires genetic variation, but one fundamental determinant of sex ratios - the propensity of female larvae to develop into young queens or workers (\"queen bias\") - is thought to be largely controlled by the environment. Evidence for a genetic influence on sex ratio and queen bias is as yet restricted to a few taxa, in particular hybrids.  Because of the very short lifetime of their queens, ants of the genus Cardiocondyla are ideal model systems for the study of complete lifetime reproductive success, queen bias, and sex ratios. We found that lifetime sex ratios of the ant Cardiocondyla kagutsuchi have a heritable component. In experimental single-queen colonies, 22 queens from a genetic lineage with a highly female-biased sex ratio produced significantly more female-biased offspring sex ratios than 16 queens from a lineage with a more male-biased sex ratio (median 91.5% vs. 58.5% female sexuals). Sex ratio variation resulted from different likelihood of female larvae developing into sexuals (median 50% vs. 22.6% female sexuals) even when uniformly nursed by workers from another colony. Consistent differences in lifetime sex ratios and queen bias among queens of C. kagutsuchi suggest that heritable, genetic or maternal effects strongly affect caste determination. Such variation might provide the basis for adaptive evolution of queen and worker strategies, though it momentarily constrains the power of workers and queens to optimize caste ratios.]",

    "abstract": "Biological control has been the most commonly researched control tactic within fruit fly management programs. For the first time, a review is carried out covering parasitoids and predators of fruit flies (Tephritidae) from the Americas and Hawaii, presenting the main biological control programs in this region. In this work, 31 species of fruit flies of economic importance are considered in the genera Anastrepha (11), Rhagoletis (14), Bactrocera (4), Ceratitis (1), and Zeugodacus (1). In this study, a total of 79 parasitoid species of fruit flies of economic importance are listed and, from these, 50 are native and 29 are introduced. A total of 56 species of fruit fly predators occur in the Americas and Hawaii.          *[The predation of fruit flies by ants occurs when the larva leaves the fruit to bury itself in the soil for pupation.  Ants belonging to the genera Pachycondyla, Pheidole, Pogonomyrmex, & Solenopsis are important predators of Anastrepha fraterculus larvae in Brazil.  Solenopsis saevissima was the most efficient species, with 42.86% of larvae removal in the field.]",

    "abstract": "*[The knowledge, we have to date, suggests that habitat disturbance & alien species invasion are probably the major factors affecting native spiders in the islands.  For a given natural community, the ability of species to accommodate habitat perturbation may be related more to the novelty of the perturbation than to its apparent severity.  Although native spiders appear to tolerate disruption of the species composition of the native vegetation, evidence suggests that they are severely impacted by alien arthropod predators, in particular social Hymenoptera (ants), a group not represented among native Hawaiian arthropods.  There are now 6 species of common, invasive, predatory ants in the Hawaiian Island forests: Solenopsis papuana, Paratrechina bourbonica, Technomyrmex albipes, Pheidole megacephala, P. fervens, Anoplolepis longipes, Tetramorium simillimum, & Linepithema humile.  Of these,  P. megacephala has been implicated in the extirpation of native arthropods as early as the beginning of this century.  Since then, further extinctions of native invertebrates have been attributed to P. megacephala, L. humile, & A. longipes.  However, as for other alien species, there is no evidence to show that they have been directly responsible for the elimination of arthropods at these lower elevations.  Nonetheless, there are 2 lines of circumstantial evidence to suggest that certain species of aggressive ants are likely to have played a role in the elimination of the lowland spider fauna.  First, behavioral observations of the interaction between 2 of the most aggressive ant species, P. megacephala & A. longipes, & native Hawaiian Tetragnatha spiders revealed that the native spiders failed to recognize the ants as 'dangerous' prey: ants were attacked without being wrapped in silk.  The ants would then bite the spider, at which point there was massive recruitment from the ant colony & the spider was dismembered & annihilated in a matter of minutes.  A second line of evidence to suggest that aggressive ants may have contributed to the current reduced distributional range of native spiders is that the current range of native Tetragnatha ends at the upper distributional range of  P. megacephala.  Even forests of largely native vegetation down to sea level that also contain ants, are virtually devoid of native arthropods.]",

    "abstract": "*[Islands have traditionally been considered to be any relatively small body of land completely surrounded by water.  Theories & predictions developed for true islands have been applied to a huge array of systems, from rock pools, to single tree species in forests, to oceanic islands.  Here, we examine the literature on islands in the broadest sense (i.e., whether surrounded by water or any other uninhabitable matrix) as it pertains to terrestrial arthropods.  We categorize islands according to the features they share.  The primary distinction between different island systems is \"darwinian\" islands (formed de novo) & 'fragment\" islands.  In the former, the islands have never been in contact with the source of colonists & have abundant \"empty\" ecological niche space.  On these islands, species numbers will initially increase through immigration, the rate depending on the degree of isolation.  If isolation persists, over time species formation will result in \"neo-endemics\".  When isolation is extreme, the ecological space will gradually be filled through speciation (rather than immigration) & adaptive radiation of neo-endemics.  Fragment islands are fundamentally different.  In these islands, the ecological space will initially be filled as a consequence of connection to the source of colonists prior to insularization.  Species numbers will decrease following fragmentation through the process of relaxation.  If these islands become more isolated, species will eventually arise through relictualization with the formation of \"paleo-endemics\".  Given sufficient time, this process can result in generic level endemism on ancient fragment islands, a phenomenon well illustrated in Madagascar and New Zealand.  Recognizing the distinction between the different kinds of islands is fundamental for understanding emerging patterns on each, in particular speciation, biodiversity (e.g., neo-endemics versus paleo-endemics), & conservation (e.g., naivete in interactions with alien species).]",

    "abstract": "Two field experiments designed as the biological check method (interference) and the paired-cage technique (exclusion) were used to evaluate the effectiveness of  natural enemies in maintaining low densities of the pink pineapple mealybug, Dysmicoccus brevipes (Cockerell), in pineapple plantings in Hawaii. In the biological check method, the treatments were ant-free plots and ant-infested plots. The numbers of D. brevipes, parasitized mealybugs, and immature and adult predators on the aerial parts of the plants were recorded. Results in the biological check method suggested that Anagyrus ananatis Gahan was responsible for the decline of D. brevipes densities in the absence of ants. In a second study combining the paired-cage technique and the biological check method, the treatments included mealybug-infested potted pineapple plants with no ants or mealybug natural enemies, ants but no natural enemies, natural enemies but no ants, and ants and natural enemies. This experiment showed that in the absence of the big-headed ant, Pheidole megacephala (F.), D. brevipes densities were greatly reduced by natural enemies and probably by the lack of sanitation or other ant activity. A laboratory study also was conducted to evaluate the impact of P. megacephala on oviposition and predation by A. ananatis and the coccinellid Nephus bilucernarius Mulsant, respectively.  These laboratory studies indicated that P. megacephala significantly decreased mealybug mortality induced by A. ananatis and N. bilucernarius adults via interference with natural enemy searching behavior.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are largely thought to be contemporary, having recently increased sharply in the wake of globalization. However, human commerce had already become global by the mid-16th century when the Spanish connected the New World with Europe and Asia via their Manila galleon and West Indies trade routes. We use genetic data to trace the global invasion of one of the world's most widespread and invasive pest ants, the tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata. Our results reveal a pattern of introduction of Old World populations that is highly consistent with historical trading routes suggesting that Spanish trade introduced the tropical fire ant to Asia in the 16th century. We identify southwestern Mexico as the most likely source for the invasive populations, which is consistent with the use of Acapulco as the major Spanish port on the Pacific Ocean. From there, the Spanish galleons brought silver to Manila, which served as a hub for trade with China. The genetic data document a corresponding spread of S. geminata from Mexico via Manila to Taiwan and from there, throughout the Old World. Our descriptions of the worldwide spread of S. geminata represent a rare documented case of a biological invasion of a highly invasive and globally distributed pest species due to the earliest stages of global commerce.  Samples of the 3 most closely related species to S. geminata (S. xyloni, S. amblychila, S. aurea) were used as outgroups for the phylogenetic analyses.

    "abstract": "A natural epidemic of Fusarium wilt on coca (Erythroxylum coca) in Peru prompted the suggestion of possibly using the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli as a mycoherbicide against this narcotic plant. During field trials conducted in Kauai, HI, to test the pathogenicity of the coca wilt pathogen, ants were observed removing formulations from test plots. While removal of formulations by ants was considered detrimental with respect to conducting field tests, ant removal was considered potentially beneficial in disseminating the mycoherbicide. Thus, research was initiated to assess the ability of formulation additives to alter the preference of ants for the formulated mycoherbicide. In Hawaii, preference of indigenous ants for removing formulations was tested using three different food bases (rice, rice plus canola oil, and wheat flour [gluten]). Similar tests were conducted at Beltsville, MD, using F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis, in which the formulation based on wheat flour was replaced by a formulation based on canola meal. Formulations based on wheat were preferred by ants in both locations; up to 90% of the wheat plus rice flour granules (C-6) and the wheat gluten plus kaolin granules (pesta) were removed within 24 h, while only 20% of those containing rice without oils were taken. However, when either canola, sunflower (Maryland only), or olive oil was added to the rice formulation, up to 90% of the granules were taken. The formulation based on canola meal was less attractive to ants, as only 65% of the granules were removed within a period of 24 h. Ants showed no preference with respect to presence or absence of fungal biomass. To alter the. attractiveness of the C-6 formulation to ants, C-6 was amended with three natural products. Canna and tansy leaves were added to C-6 at a ratio of 1:5 (wt/wt), while chili powder was added at 1:25 or 1:2.5 (wt/wt). Canna, tansy, and the higher rate of chili powder significantly reduced the number of C-6 granules removed by ants. Canna and tansy leaves affectedneither germination nor sporulation of the mycoherbicide, while the high concentration of chili powder reduced viability of propagules in the formulation. More F. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli-type colonies were recovered from inside ant nests (9 cm depth) than from nest surfaces, indicating that ants may distribute the mycoherbicide in the soil profile. Ants passively carried propagules of F. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli outside their bodies, as well as either very closely adhering to the outside or within their bodies.          *[In Maryland, most (>80%) ants were Pheidole spp., & these were the only ants observed removing test formulations.

    "abstract": "Extract: \"The excretion of the plant-sucking insects, aphids and coccids, is a clear, syrupy liquid and contains much unabsorbed organic material. This honeydew contains a high percentage of sugars and is much sought after as food by ants and other insects. In some cases, the excreted liquid, on drying, leaves a white deposit on the leaves. Manna is such an excretion from the coccid Trabutina mannipara feeding on tamarisk in Sinai, and according to Weber it contains 55% cane sugar, 25% invert sugar, and 19.3% dextrin, making a total of 99.3% carbohydrates. The reason for this apparently wasteful method of feeding is generally thought to be a deficiency of organic nitrogenous compounds in the plant juice. The insect must therefore take in large quantities of plant juice in order to get sufficient amino acids and proteins, with the result that it has large excess of carbohydrates to dispose. In the work reported here, this was not found to be the case with pineapple mealybugs (Pseudococcus brevipes), since large quantities of free amino acids were found to be present in their honeydew, as well as large quantities of sugars.

A few ant species (e.g. fire ants, Solenopsis sp. & leafcutting ants Atta sp.) damage plants when feeding on the tender tissue, often killing young citrus trees by girdling their trunks or cutting their leaves.  Some ants found in citrus orchards are considered as beneficial predators that kill a wide range of insects, including citrus pests, and exert an interspecific competitive pressure on harmful ant species.

The most common species was Solenopsis papuana, which was found in over half of the collections.  The relative abundance of species found by peanut butter baiting may not reflect the true abundance of ant species on East Hawaii Island.  It is well known that baits can create biases in species abundance & diversity data.

    "abstract": "Globally, many invasive alien species have caused extensive ecological and economic damage from either accidental or intentional introduction. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, has created billions of dollars in costs annually, spreading as an invasive species across the southern United States. In 1998, the red imported fire ant spread into California creating a highly probable future introduction via shipped products to Hawaii. This paper presents the estimation of potential economic impacts of the red imported fire ant (RIFA) to the state of Hawaii. Evaluation of impacts focuses on the economic sectors of (1)households, (2) agriculture (cattle and crop production), (3) infrastructure (cemeteries, churches, cities, electrical, telephone, and cable services, highways, hospitals and schools), (4) recreation, tourism and business (hotels/resort areas, golf courses, commercial businesses and tourists), and (5) government expenditures (with minimal intervention). The full annual economic costs of the red imported fire ant to Hawaii are estimated (in US$ 2006) to be $211 million/year, comprised of $77 million in damages and expenditures and $134 million in foregone outdoor opportunities to households and tourists. The present value of the projected costs of RIFA over a 20-year period after introduction total $2.5 billion. RIFA invasions across the globe indicate that economic cost-effective action in Hawaii entails implementation of prevention, early detection and rapid response treatment programs for RIFA.

Other species of mealybugs and ants also were susceptible to the treatment, particularly at the highest concentration.

Location of the main colony as well as satellite colonies is essential for effective control.  Main colonies are most often located outside the structure in living trees, dead trees, stumps, wood piles, buried wood, or wood in contact with soil.  Satellite colonies are most often encountered within the structure under insulation, in wall voids, or in other hollow areas.  For an established nest outside the structure, it is not uncommon to find 4 to 8 satellite colonies in nearby structures.  In natural settings, satellite colonies are usually located in wood that has less moisture than the parent colony.  The most effective chemical controls for carpenter ants with the least hazards to the homeowner, environment, technician, & the structure include the application of a dust formulation in wall voids & the use of wettable powder synthetic pyrethroids as perimeter sprays.]",

Two applications one month apart of either a bait containing 0.365% hydramethylnon and 0.25% S-methoprene (Extinguish Plus) or a spray containing 24% metaflumizone (BAS 320 I 240 SC) reduced foraging worker numbers by >97% as compared with untreated controls. The persistence of weather-exposed metaflumizone (0.063%) bait was also evaluated: bait applied fresh or after 7 days of weather exposure resulted in >98% ant mortality; bait exposed to weather for 14 d before application still achieved >90% mortality. In vitro submersion of W. auropunctata in 45\u221eC water for 10 min resulted in >99% mortality as compared with 28.9% mortality from submersion in ambient temperature water (26\u221eC) for 12 min. When W. auropunctata -infested potted plants were drenched with hot water (45.6\u221eC) for 11 min, the number of live ants were reduced by 99.3 and 89.3% in rhapis and fishtail palm, respectively, as compared with control plants drenched with ambient temperature water. The presence of a single W. auropunctata worker in a potted plant would fail to meet export requirements; therefore, the chemical baits and sprays and hot water treatment (45.6\u221eC for 11 min) as evaluated in this study would not individually be a sufficient quarantine protocol against little fire ants in containerized nursery plants.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic models for predicting species' distribution patterns present particular advantages and challenges relative to models developed from statistical correlations between distribution and climate. They can be especially useful for predicting the range of invasive species whose distribution has not yet reached equilibrium. Here, we illustrate how a physiological model of development for the invasive Argentine ant can be connected to differences in micro-site suitability, population dynamics and climatic gradients; processes operating at quite different spatial scales. Our study is located in the subalpine shrubland of Haleakala National Park, Hawaii, where the spread of Argentine ants Linepithema humile has been documented for the past twenty-five years. We report four main results. First, at a microsite level, the accumulation of degree-days recorded in potential ant nest sites under bare ground or rocks was significantly greater than under a groundcover of grassy vegetation. Second, annual degree-days measured where population boundaries have not expanded (456-521 degree-days), were just above the developmental requirements identified from earlier laboratory studies (445 degree-days above 15.9-degrees C). Third, rates of population expansion showed a strong linear relationship with annual degree-days. Finally, an empirical relationship between soil degree-days and climate variables mapped at a broader scale predicts the potential for future range expansion of Argentine ants at Haleakala, particularly to the west of the lower colony and the east of the upper colony. Variation in the availability of suitable microsites, driven by changes in vegetation cover and ultimately climate, provide a hierarchical understanding of the distribution of Argentine ants close to their cold-wet limit of climatic tolerances. We conclude that the integration of physiology, population dynamics and climate mapping holds much promise for making more robust predictions about the potential spread of invasive species.",

Winged males behave peacefully similar to the males of other ant species, but ergatoid males attack and kill rival ergatoid males with their strong mandibles and attempt to monopolize mating with all young queens that emerge in their maternal nest. Both ergatoid and winged males are capable of a surprisingly high number of inseminations (more than 40). Sperm supply appears to be depleted in old winged males but ergatoid males are still capable of successfully copulating with queens only one or two days before their death. Histological studies have shown that spermatogenesis continues throughout the whole life of ergatoid males but stops in winged males between three and eight days after eclosion.

    "abstract": "While reproduction and longevity are negatively correlated in a large number of animals, this fundamental trade-off appears to be absent from social insect queens. Here, we examine the distribution of the life-spans of queens and their mates and the age-trajectory of reproduction in experimental colonies of the Pacific tramp ant Cardiocondyla cf. kagutsuchi. Queens of Cardiocondyla are generally short-lived (0.5-2 years), which allows determining their lifetime reproductive success and establishing mortality tables. We show that the queen's total number of sexual offspring is positively associated with its life-span. Regular counts of eggs, larvae, and pupae suggest that more fecund queens live longer than less fecund queens and that an early onset of sexual production does not negatively affect the queen's life-span. This corroborates the view that the costs of reproduction are not born by the queen itself. The number of eggs present in colonies increased with queen's age until shortly before death, indicating negligible reproductive senescence. Sex ratios were strongly affected by the origin of queens but neither by colony size nor total productivity. Several queens produced only males late in their lives, suggesting the occurrence of sperm depletion. Male life-span was not correlated with any other studied trait. Our study shows that the ant genus Cardiocondyla provides a suitable model system to investigate the evolution of life-span in social insect queens and males.",

    "abstract": "Most disturbed habitats in the tropics and subtropics harbor numerous species of invasive ants, and occasionally the same species has been introduced repeatedly from multiple geographical sources. We examined how experimental crossbreeding between sexuals from different populations affects the fitness of queens of the tramp ant Cardiocondyla itsukii, which is widely distributed in Asia and the Pacific Islands. Eggs laid by queens that mated with nestmate males had a higher hatching rate than eggs laid by queens mated to males from neighboring (Hawaii \u25ca Kauai) or distant introduced populations (Hawaii/Kauai \u25ca Okinawa). Furthermore, inbreeding queens had a longer lifespan and produced a less female\u0010biased offspring sex ratio than queens from allopatric mating. This suggests that the genetic divergence between different source populations may already be so large that in case of multiple invasions eventual crossbreeding might negatively affect the fitness of tramp ants.",

Recent studies have identified additional factors that mayhave contributed to the failure of this agent to establish. First, the mirid is incompatible with some of the hairier & tougher leafed varieties of L. camara with significantly less oviposition. Second, feeding by F. intermedia has been shown to induce an increase in systemic plant resistance (leaf toughness, leaf hairiness) in new leaves, leading to a significant reduction in the agent's reproduction & impact.  Third, there is evidence of ant predation by 2 Crematogaster spp. of ants on F. intermedia.  The ants removed 50% of the mobile F. intermedia nymphs, while survival on ant excluded shrubs was significantly higher.]",

    "abstract": "We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), designate critical habitat for the Blackburn's sphinx moth (Manduca blackburni), pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act).  A total of approximately 22,440 hectares (55,451 acres) fall within the boundaries of the 9 critical habitat units designated on the Hawaiian islands of Hawaii, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Molokai for Blackburn's sphinx moth.  This critical habitat designation requires the Service to consult under section 7 of the Act with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by a Federal agency.  Section 4 of the Act requires us to consider economic and other relevant impacts when specifying any particular area as critical habitat.  We solicited data and comments from the public on all aspects of our proposal, including data on economic and other impacts of the designation.  Ants are not a natural component of Hawaii's arthropod fauna, and native species evolved in the absence of predation pressure from ants.  Ants can be particularly destructive predators because of their high densities, recruitment behavior, aggressiveness, and broad range of diet.  Because they are often generalist feeders, ants may affect prey populations independent of prey density, and may locate and destroy isolated individuals and populations. At least 36 species of ants have become established in the Hawaiian Islands, and 3 particularly aggressive species have severely affected the native insect fauna.",

We detail 11 eradications of 5 species, which are all the remaining eradications that we are aware of that have not been published.  Data from these eradications are combined with all other published successes to provide a brief summary of the 76 records of ant eradications achieved without the use of organochlorines, & compared with successes achieved within the organochlorines era.  The majority of eradications (42) are very small (< 1 ha), in some cases being just one or a few nests.  Two species, Pheidole megacephala & Anoplolepis gracilipes, were the targets of most eradications (30 & 24 respectively).  It is only in the last decade that the size of eradications has greatly increased, but the largest eradication covered only 41 ha.  In contrast, approximately 3000 infestations covering approximately 15,800 ha were eradicated over the equivalent time using organochlorines, the largest eradication covering approximately 300 ha.  We then discuss the current global status of ant eradication management options, & identify what we see as the actions that will provide the greatest immediate enhancement of invasive ant management, which are proactive management & greater incorporation of ant biology into eradication protocols]",

    "abstract": "The inaugural Pacific Ecological Security Conference (PESC) was held in October 2022, bringing together over 100 island leaders, policy-makers, natural resource managers and global and regional invasive species experts to prioritise the critical issue of invasive species in the Pacific Islands Region. Participants confirmed that invasive species are a major threat to building and maintaining climate resilience and adaptability of Pacific Island ecosystems, as well as food security, biodiversity, sustainable livelihoods and the protection of cultural resources and way of life. Three region-wide strategic action plans were developed to guide interventions focused on the topics of invasive ants, coconut rhinoceros beetle and the use of biological control as a pest and weed management tool. These plans were the major outcome of the PESC and, when implemented, will result in coordinated activities that take a 'whole-of-Pacific' approach to invasive species biosecurity and management. Here, we briefly describe the background, planning and engagement process for the three plans, summarise any country- and territory-level data obtained through the process and detail what is planned to occur over the next few years. In addition to the adoption and implementation of the strategies as a result of this inaugural PESC, we anticipate that the PESC will become the premier regional conference aimed at reducing the entry and impacts of invasive species to improve sustainability of environments and peoples of the Pacific.

    "abstract": "The banana aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa Coquerel (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is the most economically important pest of banana (Musa spp.) fields in Hawaii. Recently, there has been a concerted effort in Hawaii to learn more about the biology and ecology of this pest. However, limited work has been directed at determining the distribution of P. nigronervosa in banana fields and developing an integrated pest management plan. Therefore, a survey was conducted in banana fields throughout the Hawaiian Islands to determine the distribution and density of P. nigronervosa within banana mats from plants of different stages. Another aim was to determine whether the presence of ants on banana plants could be used as a reliable indicator of aphid infestations. Results of the survey showed that plants less than 1.5 m (small sucker) in height contain the highest aphid populations per meter in plant height and that mother plants (greater than 2.5 m) had the lowest aphid counts and rate of infestation compared with small and intermediate suckers (>1.5 < 2.5 m). More specifically, aphid population was reduced by approximately equal to 12 aphids for every meter increase in plant height and that aphids are rarely found greater than 2.5 m within the plant canopy. Although there was an increase likelihood of finding ants on banana plants with higher aphid densities, results suggest that ants would be present on plants in the absence of aphids. Implications of these and other findings with respect to sampling and managing P. nigronervosa and associated Banana bunchy top virus are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Lava tube cave ecosystems on the volcanic islands of Hawai'i support communities of rare and highly specialized cave arthropods. In these cave ecosystems, plant roots, both living and dead, provide the main energy source for cave animals. Loss of deep-rooted plants over caves will affect populations of cave-adapted animals living below. Furthermore, the loss of native plant species will likely eliminate host specific cave animals. Thus, identification of plant roots currently found in caves is necessary for the development of effective management actions that encourage the growth of appropriate deep-rooted plant species, thereby protecting the underlying cave ecosystem. We used molecular techniques to identify plant roots found within cave ecosystems on the islands of Maui and Hawai'i. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the 5.8S gene of nuclear ribosomal DNA from cave roots were compared to sequences of known plant species either collected on the surface over the footprint of each cave or to sequences accessioned in GenBank. Roots in the cave ecosystem studied on Maui belonged to two alien tree species: Eucalyptus tereticornis and Grevillea robusta. Within the Hawai'i cave ecosystem, roots of two plant species were identified: the alien tree G. robusta and the native vine Cocculus orbiculatus. The Maui cave ecosystem supports populations of at least 28 species of arthropods, including eight that are blind obligate cave inhabitants. The Hawai'i cave ecosystem supports 18 arthropod species, of which three are cave-adapted. Creating protected reserves around biologically significant caves, controlling, and preventing the introduction of harmful invasive plant species within the cave footprint, and encouraging the establishment of deep-rooted native plant species is essential for the continued survival of the unique ecosystems found within Hawaiian lava tube cave systems.          *[Ants are widespread cave visitors & leaf litter inhabitants.]",

Nest densities in this population increase with distance from the leading edge of the invasion, reaching a stable density plateau approximately 80 m from the edge, more than 2 years after colonization.  Although the number of queens per nest in Haleakala is generally lower than previously reported for Argentine ants, there is significant variation in queen number across this population.  Both the observed & effective queen numbers increase across the density gradient.  Nests in the center of the population contain queen numbers 3 to 9 times higher than those on the edge of the invasion.  The number of workers per nest is correlated with queen number.  Nests in the center are 6 times larger than nests at the edge.  Microsatellite analysis of relatedness among nestmates reveals that all nests in the Haleakala population are characterized by low-relatedness and have evidence of multiple reproducing queens.  Relatedness values are significantly lower in nests in the center of the population, indicating that the number of reproducing queens is greater in areas of high nest density.  This variation in queen number & nestmate relatedness is consistent with expectations based on changes in ecological constraints during the invasion of a new habitat, suggesting that the social structure of Argentine ant populations is strongly influenced by ecological factors.]",

    "abstract": "The extraordinary success of unicolonial insect invaders has renewed interest in the origins and maintenance of unicoloniality, a social system characterized by the absence of aggressive behavior between individuals of neighboring conspecific nests. In this study, I explore how traits associated with unicoloniality, particularly nest budding and the local exchange of workers between nests, vary across environments. Comparisons of nest characteristics in three introduced populations of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, reveal considerable variation in nest density and social structure across populations. The population with the highest nest density has smaller, less productive nests and fewer queens per nest than the two populations with low nest densities. Nestmate relatedness is low in all populations, but multi-locus genotype analyses reveal that levels of connectivity vary among populations. In particular, high nest density is associated with higher levels of genotypic similarity between nests. Assignment distances in the two populations with low nest density are similar to a native population, suggesting that the amount of mixing between neighboring nests is shared among some native and introduced populations. Because the study populations are similar in age and genetic diversity, these results suggest that the social structure of L. humile populations depend on the ecological context. Understanding the patterns of expression of unicolonial traits in different environments helps to shed light on the origins of unicoloniality and to explain the success of Argentine ants as invaders.",

Chapter 4 provides insights into the population structure of C. venustula.

In the 1st experiment, mealybugs were placed on preflowering pineapple plants with and without ants for 3 mo. In the 2nd experiment, mealybugs were placed on pineapple fruits with and without ants for 3 mo. In this experiment, ants had the opportunity to move mealybugs from one pineapple to another. In both experiments, mealybug populations tended by ants were not significantly larger than populations without ants. There was no evidence that ants transported mealybugs from one fruit to another. Nor was there evidence that the accumulation of honeydew resulted in increased D. neobrevipes mortality. The results of these experiments suggest that in the absence of natural enemies or inclement weather, P. megacephala do not cause an increase in mealybug population size, that ants do not move D. neobrevipes from pineapple to pineapple, and that the removal of honeydew by P. megacephala does not benefit D. neobrevipes.",

    "abstract": "1. Sympatric flower visitor species often partition nectar and pollen and thus affect each other's foraging pattern. Consequently, their pollination service may also be influenced by the presence of other flower visiting species. Ants are solely interested in nectar and frequent flower visitors of some plant species but usually provide no pollination service. Obligate flower visitors such as bees depend on both nectar and pollen and are often more effective pollinators.  2. In Hawaii, we studied the complex interactions between flowers of the endemic tree Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) and both, endemic and introduced flower-visiting insects. The former main-pollinators of M. polymorpha were birds, which, however, became rare. We evaluated the pollinator effectiveness of endemic and invasive bees and whether it is affected by the type of resource collected and the presence of ants on flowers.  3. Ants were dominant nectar-consumers that mostly depleted the nectar of visited inflorescences. Accordingly, the visitation frequency, duration, and consequently the pollinator effectiveness of nectar-foraging honeybees (Apis mellifera) strongly decreased on ant-visited flowers, whereas pollen-collecting bees remained largely unaffected by ants. Overall, endemic bees (Hylaeus spp.) were ineffective pollinators.  4. The average net effect of ants on pollination of M. polymorpha was neutral, corresponding to a similar fruit set of ant-visited and ant-free inflorescences.  5. Our results suggest that invasive social hymenopterans that often have negative impacts on the Hawaiian flora and fauna may occasionally provide neutral (ants) or even beneficial net effects (honeybees), especially in the absence of native birds.",

    "abstract": "*[We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack floral features that exclude ants & therefore would be heavily exploited by introduced, invasive ants.  To test this hypothesis, ant-flower interactions involving co-occurring native & introduced plants were observed in 10 sites on 3 Hawaiian Islands.  As predicted, flowers of plants that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii were more strongly exploited by ants than flowers of co-occurring introduced plants, which shared an evolutionary history with ants.  We also found that the percentage of plant species with ant-visited flowers was much higher in Hawaii than in other continental & island systems, even reaching 100 % in habitats dominated by endemic species.  We showed experimentally that the absence of ants on flowers of most introduced & few native plants species was due to morphological barriers, repellent floral scents &, to a lesser extent, unpalatable nectar.  Analysis of floral volatiles, however, revealed no consistent ant-repellent 'syndrome' attributable to negative responses by ants, probably due tothe high chemical variability within the floral scent bouquets.]",

    "abstract": "A literature survey identified 403 primary research publications that investigated the ecological effects of invasive alien insects and/or the mechanisms underlying these effects. The majority of these studies were published in the last 8 years and nearly two-thirds were carried out in North America. These publications concerned 72 invasive insect species, of which two ant species, Solenopsis invicta and Linepithema humile, accounted for 18% and 14% of the studies, respectively. Most publications investigated effects on native biodiversity at population or community level. Genetic effects and, to a lesser extent, effects on ecosystem services and processes were rarely explored. We review the effects caused by different insect invaders according to: their ecosystem roles, i.e. herbivores, predators, parasites, parasitoids and pollinators; the level of biological organization at which they occur; and the direct and indirect mechanisms underlying these effects. The best documented effects occur in invasive ants, Eurasian forest herbivores invasive in North America, and honeybees. Impacts may occur through simple trophic interactions such as herbivory, predation or parasitism. Alien species may also affect native species and communities through more complex mechanisms such as competition for resources, disease transmission, apparent competition, or pollination disruption, among others. Finally, some invasive insects, particularly forest herbivores and ants, are known to affect ecosystem processes through cascading effects. We identify biases and gaps in our knowledge of ecological effects of invasive insects and suggest further opportunities for research.          *[S. wagneri has been supressed in favor of S. invicta.

In laboratory assays, we assessed agonistic interactions of these ant species with the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, another extremely invasive social insect.  These assays provide information on ecological interactions & the invasive biology of these 4 ants.  We used a rating system based on the first 2o behavioral responses of the 2 insects paired in each bioassay.  Following published methods, the rating system was as follows: avoidance (-1), no response (0), aggression (+1).  Of the 4 ant species used in this study, W. auropunctata demonstrated greater aggression towards C. formosanus than the other ants.  Coptotermes formosanus, in turn, showed less aggressive behavior towards W. auropunctata than towards L. falcigera & C. variegatus.

    "abstract": "Many tropical insect species remain formally undescribed, and the validity of some rarely collected and poorly studied taxa is uncertain. Overbeckia Viehmeyer, 1916 is a monotypic ant genus and a rare member of the arboreal ant communities of tropical South East Asia and Australasia. Overbeckia subclavata Viehmeyer, 1916 was collected and described from Singapore more than a century ago and there have been few other records of these ants since. Here we compare the existing Overbeckia records with recent collections in Australia, New Guinea and Indonesia. We revise the taxonomic diagnosis of the genus Overbeckia in comparison with other genera of the diverse tribe Camponotini, redescribe O. subclavata and describe two new species, Overbeckia papuana sp. nov., and Overbeckia jambiensis, sp. nov. We also summarise all available ecological and distributional information of the genus, indicating that Overbeckia occurs in a variety of lowland vegetation types, from rainforests to secondary growth and plantations but is extremely rare. Using external morphological characters, internal proventricular structures and a molecular phylogeny of 78 Camponotini species based on five protein-coding loci, we demonstrate that Overbeckia is a monophyletic lineage. Molecular-clock calibrated trees using 21 fossil records indicate that the divergence between Overbeckia and its sister clade comprising the genera Echinopla Smith, 1857 and Calomyrmex Emery, 1895 occurred c. 21Ma (95% highest posterior density 14-28), and that the divergence between the three Overbeckia species likely occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene. In addition, we transfer one Camponotus Mayr, 1861 species to Colobopsis in the light of molecular evidence: Colobopsis triangulata (Klimes & McArthur, 2014) comb. nov. Our analysis represents the most comprehensive phylogeny of the tribe Camponotini in terms of coverage of extant divergent lineages, including Overbeckia , and suggests relatively robust phylogenetic relationships among genera that are consistent with published phylogenomic trees. Overall, our study reveals cryptic species diversity in Overbeckia and provides strong evidence that this is a valid and polytypic ant genus.",

Potential distribution maps are based on climate models developed from known localities in its native range and its Hawaiian range. We also present results of analysis of stomach contents of a sample of 34 chameleons collected from native, predominantly dryland, forest on Maui. These data are the first summarizing prey range of this non-native species in an invaded native-forest setting. Potential distribution models predict that the species can occur throughout most of Hawaii from sea level to >2,100 m elevation. Important features of this data set are that approximately one-third of the diet of these lizards is native insects, and the lizards are consuming large numbers of arthropods each day. Prey sizes span virtually the entire gamut of native Hawaiian arthropod diversity, thereby placing a large number of native species at risk of predation. Our dietary results contrast with expectations for most iguanian lizards and support suggestions that chameleons comprise a third distinct foraging-mode category among saurians. The combination of expanding distribution, large potential range size, broad diet, high predation rates, and high densities of these chameleons imply that they may well become a serious threat to some of the Hawaiian fauna.

    "abstract": "Executive Summary:   1. The Haleakala Argentine Ant Project is an ongoing effort to study the ecology of the invasive Argentine ant in the park, and if possible to develop a strategy to control this destructive species.  2. Past research has demonstrated that the Argentine ant causes very significant impacts on native arthropods where it invades, threatening a large portion of the park's biodiversity in subalpine shrubland and alpine aeolian ecosystems.  3. Patterns of spread over the past 30+ years indicate that the invasion process is influenced to a substantial degree by abiotic factors such as elevation, rainfall and temperature, and that the ant has not reached its potential range. Predictions of total range in the park suggest that it has only invaded a small fraction of available suitable habitat, confirming that this species is one of most serious threats to the park's natural resources.  4. Numerous experiments have been conducted since 1994 in an attempt to develop a method for eradicating the Argentine ant at Haleakala using pesticidal ant baits. Thirty baits have been screened for attractiveness to ants in the park, and ten of these were tested for effectiveness of control in field plots. While some of these baits have been very effective in reducing numbers of ants, none has been able to eliminate all nests in experimental plots.  5. Research into a secondary management goal of ant population containment was initiated in 1996. By treating only expanding margins of the park's two ant populations with an ant pesticide, rates of outward spread were substantially reduced in some areas. While this strategy was implemented from 1997 to 2004, it was ultimately discontinued after 2004 because of the difficulty and insufficient effectiveness of the technique.  6. In order to achieve the types of results necessary for eradication, the project would probably need to explore the possibility of developing a specialized bait, rather than relying on a commercially produced bait. An alternative would be to pursue approval to use Xstinguish bait, a commercial bait manufactured in New Zealand and not registered for use in the US, which has yielded good results against Argentine ants. Either route would involve significant regulatory hurdles. Because the baits ultimately used would likely be liquid or paste in form, there would also be major logistical challenges in devising methods to successfully apply the baits across the two large ant populations at Haleakala.

    "abstract": "Local dispersal of insects is mediated by fine-scale variation in the physical environment.  Quantifying this influence is difficult in many cases, due to complex dispersal patterns, gentle climatic gradients, and the confounding effects of strong biotic interactions. However, invasive ants often spread through budding, greatly simplifying dispersal patterns and in some cases clarifying the role of physical factors in shaping these patterns. At Haleakala National Park, Hawaii, two disjunct unicolonial populations of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) have been dispersing in this fashion for over 40 years, producing patterns consistent with the diffusion model of spread. At the same time, an absence of strong predators or competitors, combined with steep climatic gradients at this locale, permit an analysis of the influence of abiotic variables such as temperature and rainfall on the rate and direction of this spread. We discuss how quantification of abiotic factors, as well as biotic factors that affect the physical environment, and the use of tools such as degree-day models can help in understanding both local behavior (e.g. nest site selection) and supercolony-level invasion dynamics. The ultimate goal of this small scale modelling effort is to develop better capacity for regional predictions of invasion patterns.

    "abstract": "Invasive ants can have strong ecological effects on native arthropods, but most information on this topic comes from studies of a handful of ant species. The ecological impacts of the many additional introduced 'tramp' ant species are largely unknown. In mesic upland forests of O'ahu, Hawai'i, ten species of introduced ants were found on four species of understory trees. However, these ants were generally uncommon and occurred at relatively low densities in this habitat type. The most common and abundant ant was Plagiolepis alluaudi, which favored the native tree Pipturus albidus. Ecological effects of ants on arthropods were found to be modest, with overall arthropod community composition not significantly different between ant-occupied and ant-free trees. Most taxonomic groups were similar in abundance and richness between ant-occupied and ant-free trees, except adventive Coleoptera, adventive Hemiptera, and Lepidoptera were less abundant on ant-occupied trees, and adventive Coleoptera and adventive Hemiptera also had lower richness on ant-occupied trees. Among Lepidoptera, caterpillars of two endemic groups had significantly lower incidences on trees with higher ant abundances, while other caterpillars did not. Arthropod trophic structure was largely unaffected, except that chewing herbivores comprised a smaller fraction of biomass on ant-occupied trees. While overall ecological effects were weak in comparison to prior results involving other ant species in Hawai\u0018i, some of the impacts suggest that higher densities of these introduced ant species could result in similar interactions with arthropods as those of the better-studied invasive ant species.          *[A total of 714 ants belonging to 10 species were collected in the 384 samples.

Ant invasion was usually associated with significant changes in overall community composition, as measured by Bray-Curtis distances, particularly among endemic subsets of the communities.  Changes in mean species richness were also strong at 3 of the 5 sites.  Among sites, diversity was negatively related to stability as measured by resistance to overall compositional change, but this effect could not be separated from the strong negative effect of invasive ant density on compositional stability.  When compositional stability was measured as proportional change in richness, the best predictor of stability among endemic community subsets was endemic richness, with richer communities losing proportionately more species than species-poor communities.  This effect was highly significant even after controlling for differences in invasive ant density & suggested that communities that had already lost many endemic species were resistant to further species loss upon ant invasion, while more intact communities remained vulnerable to species loss.  Communities underwent strong, but idiosyncratic functional shifts in association with ant invasion, both in terms of trophic structure & total arthropod biomass.  There were no apparent relationships, however, between functional stability & community diversity or density measures.  Instead, invasive ant density was the best among-site predictor of the magnitude of functional change.]",

Many studies therefore rely on a comparative observational approach, in which invaded areas are compared to similar nearby uninvaded areas, but this approach suffers from reduced inferential power because of the inability to randomly assign treatments. When possible, the best solution may be to incorporate comparative sampling over time, from before and after invasion, as a means of validating comparisons across space. We used this approach to assess the impacts of Argentine and big-headed ants on arthropod communities at two natural area sites in the Hawaiian Islands. Two sampling events, separated by 2 years, indicated that invaded plots at each site were significantly different from uninvaded plots in terms of overall community composition and distributions of certain indicator species. This compositional change associated with ant invasion was accompanied by a significant decrease in arthropod species richness at one site, but not at the second site. Changes in arthropod communities from before invasion to after invasion in separate before-after plots at each site were qualitatively consistent with the aforementioned changes measured across the invasion boundaries, but were smaller in magnitude because the invasion processes were still in early stages. Together, these findings support the inference that carefully planned studies of biological invasions that use a comparative observational approach can provide an accurate picture of resultant community level changes, and illustrate an effective method for validating such studies.",

    "abstract": "Invasive species are causing population declines and extinctions of native species worldwide. Correlates of species vulnerability, which help identify at-risk taxa, are not well developed for arthropods, particularly with respect to threats from invasive species. At five sites undergoing invasion by ants in the Hawaiian Islands, we assessed body size, population density, trophic role and provenance (introduced or endemic to the Hawaiian Islands) as potential correlates of vulnerability for 300 arthropod species. Among rare species, provenance was the most important factor associated with absence from invaded plots, with endemic species much more commonly absent. Trophic role was also important, but only when interacting with provenance: endemic carnivores were by far the most vulnerable group, followed by endemic detritivores. For non-rare species, Hawaii endemics were significantly more reduced in invaded plots compared to introduced species. In addition, species that occurred at lower population densities were more vulnerable than those occurring at higher densities. Body size did not correlate with vulnerability for either rare or non-rare species. Despite these trends, there was relatively high variability in responses to invasion among species in many taxonomic orders, as well as among populations of particular species at different sites. While the consideration of additional intrinsic traits might increase predictive ability to some degree (e.g., intrinsic traits only explained 21% of the variation in impact among non-rare species), community-specific extrinsic factors appear to play a large role in influencing outcomes for many species, making prediction substantially more difficult.",

    "abstract": "The invasive immigrant Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), has spread to occupy roughly 120 ha, or 15%, of the nesting habitat of the endangered Hawaiian Dark-rumped Petrel (Pterodroma phaeopygia sandwichensis) in Haleakala National Park on the island of Maui, Hawaii.  The colony at Haleakala is responsible for most of the known reproduction of the endemic seabird, and concern arose that the Argentine ant may reduce petrel breeding success at this important site.  Investigations in ant-infested areas of the petrel colony, however, showed that the nesting success rate (53.7%) was not significantly different from the nesting success rate in adjacent ant-free areas (50.0%).  While the ant occurred more frequ!  ently at the entrances of burrows with recent petrel activity, high numbers of ants or foraging trails within the petrel burrows were seen only rarely.  Cold soil surface temperatures may inhibit ant foraging into the deeper parts of the burrows, where incubation and chick development occur.  At current levels, the Argentine ant is not believed to significantly influence the nesting success rate of the Hawaiian Dark-rumped Petrel.",

Patterns of foraging activity were strongly tied to soil temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that variation in temperature can influence rates of spread.

    "abstract": "Limiting dispersal is a fundamental strategy in the control of invasive species, and in certain situations containment of incipient populations may be an important management technique. To test the feasibility of slowing the rapid spread of two Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) supercolonies in Haleakala National Park, Hawaii, we applied ant bait and toxicant within an experimental plot situated along a supercolony boundary. The 120\u25ca260\tm plot simulated a small section of what could potentially be a 120\tm wide treatment encompassing the entire expanding boundaries of both supercolonies. Foraging ant numbers at baited monitoring stations decreased sharply within two weeks after treatment, and ant spread was completely halted within the plot for at least one year. In contrast, an adjacent untreated colony boundary advanced an average of 65.2\tm over the course of 1 year. Most of this spread took place in the summer and fall, at the time of highest ant abundance at bait monitoring stations, while no outward dispersal occurred during the spring and early summer. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that local budding dispersal in this unicolonial species stems from density dependent pressure rather than inherent founding behavior associated with mating. Based on results from this experiment, we are investigating the effectiveness of annual boundary treatments in slowing the Argentine ant invasion at Haleakala National Park. The goals of this program are to protect populations of native arthropods and to keep options open for eventual attempts at eradication.

    "abstract": "Ants represent a wholly introduced component of Hawaiian ecosystems. The establishment of roughly 45 ant species over the past two centuries has wide ranging implications for agriculture, other sectors of the economy, and the conservation of native biodiversity. Although ants have received considerable attention in Hawaii, many questions regarding the factors that determine their distributions and influence patterns of species co-occurrence remain largely unexplored. More focus has been directed at their ecological effects, both in agriculture, where they tend pestiferous homopteran insects, and in natural areas, where they can directly threaten native invertebrates and vertebrates and indirectly impact native plants. Increased awareness of the negative repercussions of ant introductions in Hawaii has led to improvements in preventative quarantine policy in the last decade, however agencies responsible for ant and other invasive species interdiction remain severely understaffed. Efforts to control or eradicate ant infestations for conservation purposes in Hawaii represent a recent development, and have so far met with variable success. Such efforts may also require a greater investment to improve results. The threat of other destructive ant species, such as the red imported fire ant, arriving in Hawaii underscores the importance of an early detection network and an established infrastructure ready for rapid response.

    "abstract": "Threats to endangered insect species that act independently of those associated with habitat loss are often suspected, but are rarely confirmed or quantified. This may hinder the development of the most effective recovery strategies, which are increasingly needed for listed insects. Since 2006, 14 species of flies within the large, showy Hawaiian picture-winged Drosophila group have been added to the US threatened and endangered species list. Many of these species are thought to be limited by host plant rarity, but also by predation on immature stages by invasive ants. We tested the latter hypothesis with a field experiment involving Drosophila crucigera, a more common surrogate for sympatric endangered species, and the invasive ant Solenopsis papuana, on the island of O'ahu. We established ant suppression and control plots across three forest sites. Within each plot we placed a host plant branch piece, into which lab-reared flies had oviposited, and subsequently tracked weekly emergence of adults. Numbers of flies that emerged were 2.4 times higher in ant-suppressed plots than in control plots; this 58% reduction in survival from egg to adult in the presence of ants was similar across all three sites. Among plots, numbers of emerged flies exhibited a pattern suggesting that the detrimental effect of ants is density dependent. These results confirm that S. papuana, and possibly other invasive ant species, can strongly impact the reproductive success of Hawaiian picture-winged Drosophila. They also point to several management actions, beyond habitat restoration, that may improve the recovery of these imperiled flies.

As it continues to expand its range, an effort has been undertaken to eradicate it, or at the least, control its spread. The 1st part of this effort focused on finding a bait carrier for subsequent toxicant-based control tests. A year-long bait preference test was implemented at each of the ant's 2 infestation sites in Haleakala National Park, in which 6 solid baits and 2 liquid baits were assessed for attractiveness and feasibility for large scale control. At both sites, a toxicant-free formulation of Maxforce, a protein-based granular bait made from ground silkworm. Bombyx mori (L.), pupae, and a 25% sugar water solution were the most attractive baits. Ants took more Maxforce (without toxicant) and sugar water than all other baits, including honey granules and a fish protein bait. Sugar water, however, is difficult to distribute over large natural areas. Maxforce was therefore concluded to be the best bait carrier for toxicant-based control at Haleakala National Park because of its attractiveness and its ease for large scale broadcast dispersal.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to develop a chemical control strategy for the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), in Haleakala National Park, Maxforce, which is formulated with 0.9% hydramethylnon, was used in test plots to determine the efficacy of the ant bait in the field. Initially, Maxforce was tested at 2 application rates: broadcast at 2.25 kg/ha (2 lb/acre) and 4.5 kg/ha (4 lb/acre). Later, the following treatments were also tested: a Maxforce and honey granule mix, Maxforce with 0.5% hydramethylnon, Maxforce with a different solvent, Maxforce distributed in exposed piles, and Maxforce distributed in covered piles. Although there were significant differences in the magnitude of ant reduction among the various treatments, all yielded the same general result. Foraging ant numbers at monitoring bait stations declined an average maximum of 97.0% in the test plots, with no plots achieving 100 reduction. At 2 mo after treatment the mean number of foraging ants was reduced by 92.1%. Nest survival in the plots appeared to be affected to a lesser degree, but could not be monitored accurately over the longer term because of the phenomenon of nest movement. A 2nd identical application 1 mo after the initial application in plots treated with Maxforce at 2.25 and 4.5 kg/ha did not result in eradication. Bait molding, quick mortality, and  toxicant breakdown from UV radiation created a short exposure time to the bait and toxicant, which may have been the main obstacle to achieving eradication.

To quantify the size & overlap of exploited space, we applied dynamic range boxes.  On average, exotic flower visitors were more generalized in resource use (larger exploited space) than natives ones, which is additionally indicated by the absence of native flower visitors on exotic flowering plant species.  In particular, exploited space based on floral scent emission was larger for exotic flower visitors compared to native ones.  The unevenly expanded exploited space of native & exotic animals led to an asymmetric overlap of floral exploited space where exotic flower visitors shared only a small proportion of their ES with natives, but occupied a large proportion of the exploited space of natives.  The asymmetry in resource use of native & exotic flower visitors suggests a potential advantage in resource exploitation of the latter, potentially explaining their success in Hawaiian ecosystems.]",

Here we report nearly 100% prevalence of Wolbachia in the global populations of the yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes. To understand coevolutionary history between Wolbachia and A. gracilipes, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Wolbachia from the ant across 12 geographical regions and compared the phylogeny of SNP-based Wolbachia to patterns of the ant\u0019s mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation. Our results revealed a strong concordance between phylogenies of Wolbachia and host mtDNA, providing immediate evidence of co-divergence. Among eight identified SNP loci separating the genetic clusters of Wolbachia, seven loci are located in potential protein-coding genes, three of which being non-synonymous SNPs that may influence gene functions.

These plants were subsequently sold to consumers along the east coast of the Island, along with Little Fire Ant colonies living in the potting medium. LFA is now thriving and continues to spread. Fifteen years after the initial detection in 1999, LFA has spread to over 4000 locations on the island of Hawaii and has been found in isolated locations on Kauai, Maui, and Oahu Islands. Current efforts are expected to contain the infestations on the other islands but significant additional investment is needed to halt the rapid spread of LFA on the island of Hawaii. Increased management expenditures can suppress infestations; reduce spread between sectors; and decrease long-term management costs, damages, and stings. An immediate expenditure of $8 million in the next 2-3years plus follow-up prevention, monitoring, and mitigation treatments will yield $1.210 billion in reduced control costs, $129 million in lowered economic damages, 315 million fewer human sting incidents, and 102 million less pet sting incidents over 10years. Over 35years, the benefits include $5.496 billion in reduced control costs, $538 million less economic damages, 2.161 billion fewer human sting incidents, and 762 million fewer pet sting incidents.",

    "abstract": "We compare selected aspects of the biotas of long-isolated islands ranging in size from R\u00c8union to early Pliocene South America, focusing on Madagascar, New Zealand, New Caledonia and the Hawaiian Islands. Although Madagascar and New Zealand were joined to larger land masses less than 90 million years ago, their biotas are overwhelmingly dominated by descendants of colonists from overseas. The size of a long-isolated land mass decisively influences major features of its ecosystem. On smaller islands, extinction is more likely, colonization is rarer, and there are fewer opportunities for diversification. The largest herbivores and the largest carnivores are smaller on smaller islands. Reduced diversity, lower predation pressure and diminished evolutionary innovation reduce the severity of competition on smaller islands: their plants are less well defended against vertebrate herbivores, and their primary productivity is lower, while their animals are longer-lived, less fecund, and have lower basal metabolism than mainland ecological counterparts. Herbivores are most likely to evolve convergently with counterparts on other land masses with predators of similar size and/or efficiency. Thus sloth lemurs converged on tree sloths, Megaladapis on koalas, and moa-nalos on moas and elephant birds. The degree of an island's isolation also affects its ecosystem's characteristics. More isolated islands receive fewer immigrants, so diversity is lower on more isolated islands, especially small islands with high risks of extinction. Fewer mainland immigrants, whose efficiency was tested against a variety of competitors and well-defended prey, reach more isolated islands, so competition is less intense on these islands, and these islands' predators are less efficient. Smaller size and greater isolation therefore make a land mass more invasible. Islands with the fewest predators and the slowest pace of life are most likely to be catastrophically disrupted by mainland invaders. All these phenomena have analogues in human economies. As a rule, economies with higher total production support more intense competition, more innovation, a greater diversity of occupations, a faster pace of life, and greater productivity per capita.

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are a threat to global biodiversity and provide unique opportunities to study ecological processes. Population bottlenecks are a common feature of biological invasions and the severity of these bottlenecks is likely to be compounded as an invasive species spreads from initial invasion sites to additional locations. Despite extensive work on the genetic consequences of bottlenecks, we know little about how they influence microbial communities of the invaders themselves. Due to serial bottlenecks, invasive species may lose microbial symbionts including pathogenic taxa (the enemy release hypothesis) and/or may accumulate natural enemies with increasing time after invasion (the pathogen accumulation and invasive decline hypothesis). We tested these alternate hypotheses by surveying bacterial communities of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). We found evidence for serial symbiont bottlenecks: the bacterial community richness declined over the invasion pathway from Argentina to New Zealand. The abundance of some genera, such as Lactobacillus, also significantly declined over the invasion pathway. Argentine ants from populations in the United States shared the most genera with ants from their native range in Argentina, while New Zealand shared the least (120 vs. 57, respectively). Nine genera were present in all sites around the globe possibly indicating a core group of obligate microbes. In accordance with the pathogen accumulation and invasive decline hypothesis, Argentine ants acquired genera unique to each specific invaded country. The United States had the most unique genera, though even within New Zealand these ants acquired symbionts. In addition to our biogeographic sampling, we administered antibiotics to Argentine ants to determine if changes in the micro-symbiont community could influence behavior and survival in interspecific interactions. Treatment with the antibiotics spectinomycin and kanamycin only slightly increased Argentine ant interspecific aggression, but this increase significantly decreased survival in interspecific interactions. The survival of the native ant species also decreased when the symbiotic microbial community within Argentine ants was modified by antibiotics. Our work offers support for both the enemy release hypothesis and that invasive species accumulate novel microbial taxa within their invaded range. These changes appear likely to influence invader behavior and survival.",

Four categories of studies have been reviewed herein; infective juvenile foraging strategies, recognition and evaluation of the host by infective juveniles, the actual behaviors of infective juveniles that result in infection, and the protective role of the symbiotic bacteria during nematode reproduction in the cadaver. This constitutes a chronological order of events. Two challenges are suggested. First, the data on entomopathogenic nematode behavioral ecology, while very extensive for some species, are almost completely lacking for most described species. We need to approach future studies paying more attention to phylogenetic origins of the traits that we study. Second, there is little consensus on exactly what are the traits that are worth studying.  By reviewing and synthesizing current work, we make some suggestions about where future research should be directed.

    "abstract": "Disruption of plant-pollinator interactions by invasive predators is poorly understood but may pose a critical threat for native ecosystems. In a multiyear field experiment in Hawai'i, we suppressed abundances of globally invasive predators and then observed insect visitation to flowers of six native plant species. Three plant species are federally endangered (Haplostachys haplostachya, Silene lanceolata, Tetramolopium arenarium) and three are common throughout their range (Bidens menziesii, Dubautia linearis, Sida fallax). Insect visitors were primarily generalist pollinators, including taxa that occur worldwide such as solitary bees (e.g., Lasioglossum impavidum), social bees (e.g., Apis mellifera), and syrphid flies (e.g., Allograpta exotica). We found that suppressing invasive rats (Rattus rattus), mice (Mus musculus), ants (Linepithema humile, Tapinoma melanocephalum), and yellowjacket wasps (Vespula pensylvanica) had positive effects on pollinator visitation to plants in 16 of 19 significant predator-pollinator-plant interactions. We found only positive effects of suppressing rats and ants, and both positive and negative effects of suppressing mice and yellowjacket wasps, on the frequency of interactions between pollinators and plants. Model results predicted that predator eradication could increase the frequency of insect visitation to flowering species, in some cases by more than 90%. Previous results from the system showed that these flowering species produced significantly more seed when flowers were allowed to outcross than when flowers were bagged to exclude pollinators, indicating limited autogamy. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of suppression or eradication of invasive rodents, ants, and yellowjackets to reverse pollination disruption, particularly in locations with high numbers of at\u0010risk plant species or already imperiled pollinator populations.

    "abstract": "The Hawaiian Islands support a speciose radiation of native Mecyclothorax beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). This lineage has undergone a classical island radiation resulting in extensive ecological specialization, flight-wing loss, and 100% single-island endemism. We report on the sympatric occurrence of several Mecyclothorax species endemic to Haleakala volcano, East Maui with the newly arrived, adventive Trechus obtusus (Coleoptera: Carabidae), a tramp species originally from Europe. Arrival of T. obtusus in afforested, non-native gymnosperm plantation forest near Polipoli, Maui was associated with subsequent decreased abundance of native Mecyclothorax beetles. Since discovery of T. obtusus on Haleakala, their populations have been transformed through subsequent increase in frequency of brachypterous individuals. Consequences of this transformation to flight-wing dimorphic populations may simultaneously include enhanced reproductive capacity of brachypterous individuals, increased local adaptation of populations, and enhanced metapopulational dynamics ultimately permitting range expansion and occupation far beyond anything observed for the monomorphically brachypterous native Mecyclothorax. Trechus obtusus and several Mecyclothorax species occur sympatrically with Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in subalpine shrublands on Haleakala. Recent sampling corroborates earlier findings that localized presence of Argentine ant is associated with significantly decreased abundance of native Mecyclothorax. Conversely, abundance of the continental T. obtusus is not significantly affected by ant presence.",

    "abstract": "The endemic biota of the Hawaiian archipelago, the most isolated island group on Earth, is well known to be highly vulnerable to invasions by introduced species. Haleakala National Park is one of the more intact natural areas in the archipelago, yet its floristic and faunistic lists include about half introduced species. The following introduced species at Haleakala are believed to have significant effects on populations of native species and/or ecosystem processes: 15-20 vascular plant species, feral goats, feral pigs, small Indian mongoose, two rat species, house mouse, predacious ants, ground-nesting yellowjackets, various generalist tachinid flies and ichneumonid and braconid wasps that parasitize endemic lepidopterans, predatory snails, and avian malaria. Possible reasons for the high vulnerability of endemic island organisms and island ecosystems to invasion of and displacement by alien species include relative lack of evolutionary adaptation to disturbance, possession of life history strategies inappropriate when coexisting with anthropogenically introduced species, a \"disharmonic\" biota, presence of lower species numbers than occur in comparable continental systems, reduced competitive ability due to repeated founder events, and small population size with resultant genetic \"restrictive specialization.\" Current management at Haleakala emphasizes control of feral goats and pigs. The next priority is to control selected introduced plants as well as ants and yellow-jackets which appear potentially capable of eliminating essential pollinators. In spite of some serious losses of endemic biota, most of the park is still overwhelmingly dominated by native species. With active and enlightened management, the prognosis for preservation of most native ecosystem components seems to be favorable for the foreseeable future.   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.).          *[An excellent example is the invasion of the Hawaiian Islands (where native ants are lacking) by about 40 species of alien ants, a number that appears to be near equilibrium. ]",

    "abstract": "The arthropod fauna of the shrubland ecosystem at 2000-3000m in Haleakala National Park lacks native ants. It includes many local endemics and essential pollinators of the silversword (Argyroxiphium-Dubautia) complex and other endemic plants. The aggressive and predacious Argentine ant, Iridomyrmex humilis (Mayr), has become established in the past 20 years in a slowly changing pattern of areas with and without ants. To determine its impact, quantitative sampling of the ground-dwelling arthropod fauna using pitfall traps and under-rock surveys was carried out in comparable areas with and without ants. Native noctuid moth larvae, immature Hemiptera, carabid beetles, Drosophilidae, ground-nesting bees and introduced earwigs are among the organisms significantly reduced in numbers in ant-infested areas. Ground-nesting bees of the genus Nesoprosopis and noctuid moths are among the primary pollinators of the Hawaiian flora. The Argentine ant appears to exert a serious impact on the predominantly native and ground dwelling arthropods of the shrubland ecosystem. Because of the slow spread of this ant into potential habitats, control efforts may be feasible using a carefully selected bait/toxicant formulation.

The tramp ant Monomorium pharaonis (L.) was found to be abundant in storm-petrel nesting areas on Laysan Island.  There were 380 observations made on incubating adults & 798 observations for chicks, for a total of 1178 observations from 116 storm-petrel nest sites.  No ant harassment events involving incubating adult storm-petrels were recorded.  Thirteen instances of more than 5 ants on Tristram's Storm-petrel chicks were recorded.  One harassment event was recorded, involving approximately 200 ants.  The chick left the nest site immediately following the event, did not return, & presumably died.  The number of nest failures attributed to M. pharaonis was 1% (n = 116).  There was a significant relationship between nest type & ant interactions, with incidents only recorded from birds nesting under vegetation.  It was hypothesized that the ant interactions recorded in this study were a result of Tristram's Storm-petrel chicks being in close proximity to M. pharaonis nests rather than direct predation.  Thus no evidence was found of a severe impact of invasive ants on the breeding success of storm-petrels at Laysan Island.  Despite no direct ant impact particular attention should be given to the interactions between M. pharaonis & other bird species reliant on vegetation for nesting cover.]",

    "abstract": "Endemic insect species make up the overwhelming majority of Hawaii's native fauna, and play many important ecological roles. Despite this, insects receive low levels of conservation funding, likely due to their small size, fluctuating population sizes, and lack of baseline data necessary to determine if they are threatened with extinction. To determine which insects are at risk, how insect populations fluctuate in natural areas, and which management actions are most beneficial to Hawaiian ecosystems, we propose that insects be monitored whenever possible. Insect monitoring should be broad, generating community-based metrics such as species richness, rather that focusing on individual species. Resultant data should be entered into a stable, central database. Rather than individual insect species being the explicit target of conservation, we emphasize that measures of insect diversity can provide an assessment of restoration efforts, and serve as a metric for prioritizing areas for conservation. We provide lists of additional recommendations for land managers and research entomologists who wish to assist with insect conservation efforts.

    "abstract": "Sex appears to be a rather prosaic and casual event in the life of most social Hymenoptera. In contrast, mating in the ant genus Cardiocondyla is regularly preceded by a prolonged and stereotypic courtship display. Pummeling the head of the female with mandibles and / or antennae and vibrations of the gaster, presumably stridulation, are essential parts of male courtship. The overall structure of the mating pattern is conserved throughout species and between winged and wingless, \"ergatoid\" males, but exhibits species-specific idiosyncrasies. For example, C. elegans males regularly end the interaction with a female with a short mouth-to-mouth contact.  Variation in the duration of the precopulatory phase and the copulation itself might reflect different degrees of inter- and intrasexual selection. More information on the dynamics of sperm transfer and the risk and intensity of sperm competition are needed to better understand the evolution of the complex mating behavior in this genus.          *[Colonies or fragments of colonies of different Cardiocondyla species were collected from their nests in soil (C. batesii (Forel, 1894): Sra.

    "abstract": "Clonal reproduction may facilitate the spread of invasive species by reducing the minimum population size necessary for successful establishment. We used microsatellite markers to reconstruct the composition of founding populations in two regional (Central Africa and Hawaii) and 23 local (near a Gabonese oilfield) invasions of the facultatively parthenogenetic little fire ant. Central Africa had a single dominant queen clone, which appears to have initiated the regional infestation, and then produced numerous other clones by rare sexual reproduction. This interpretation of the data was also supported by the genotype of a worker from the first collection in Africa (Gabon 1913). We found only a single queen clone in Hawaii, likewise indicating a single-clone introduction, most likely from an earlier infestation in Florida. Single-clone introductions also gave rise to the vast majority (92%) of local infestations at our oilfield study site. These results suggest the unusual, largely clonal, reproductive strategy of the little fire ant may enhance its success as an invasive species. However, the occasional sexual production of novel genotypes after the initial introduction may provide genetic flexibility that overcomes shortcomings of pure clonality.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of reproduction strategies is affected by both phylogenetic and physiological constraints. Although clonality may benefit females, it may not be selected if a male contribution is necessary to start egg laying and embryo development. In little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, sexual populations employ a typical Hymenopteran system of reproduction. In clonal populations, however, queens and males are produced with only maternal and paternal genomes, respectively, whereas sterile workers are produced sexually. Although this system requires both sexes for worker production, previous work has shown that workers may also be produced clonally by the queens. If so, why are males maintained in this species? Our data suggest that fertilization is necessary to increase the hatching rate of eggs. Although clonal queens can indeed produce both workers and queens without mating, the hatching rate is far below the level necessary to maintain functional colonies. On the other hand, virgin queens from populations exhibiting the original Hymenopteran reproduction system also show low hatching rates, but produce only haploid male eggs. Reasons for the existence of W. auropunctata males have been disputed. However, our data suggest that physiological constraints, such as the requirement for insemination, must be considered in regard to evolution of reproduction systems, in addition to ecological data and theoretical considerations of fitness.",

Pure (100%) cow\u0019s milk and a dilution (10%) of chicken egg whites were applied to W. auropunctata directly by contact spray plus residue or indirectly via residual contact only with protein-marked plant debris. Protein-marked ants were held in plastic shoe-box-sized containers, collected at 0, 24, and 48 h after exposure to their respective marks, and then examined for the presence of the marks by a chicken egg albumin and milk casein-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cross-contamination rates were assessed by allowing ants marked with egg whites to interact with an equal number marked milk for 24 and 48 h, and then collected either individually or in bulk. Results indicated that the egg white biomarker was retained longer than milk and that more ants were successfully marked when the direct spray application method was employed. Cross-contamination rates were highest among bulk-collected ants and lowest among ants collected individually after 24 h. However, the rates of cross-contamination among individually collected ants increased and were similar to that of bulk-collected ants after 48 h. On the basis of our results, external protein marking may not be suitable if mass trapping is required or if the study extends beyond 24 h due to high cross-contamination rates among specimens collected in bulk and reduced marker detection rates.

    "abstract": "Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is among the world's worst invasive species, and there is an increasing need for effective control methods for this species. Existing chemical treatments and baits used in managing other invasive ant species may not be as effective for managing W. auropunctata. Development of effective ant control treatments and baits depends on laboratory experiments to test the potential efficacy of a large number of products and control methods prior to implementation of large-scale field studies. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that laboratory-raised W. auropunctata may respond differently than their wild counterparts to bait types, and if this is the case, laboratory trials may not accurately predict results under field conditions. Here we report on experimental research investigating whether ant colonies raised in laboratories, and those in the field, show different patterns of recruitment to non-toxic baits. Laboratory and wild colony recruitment to non-toxic Hawaii Ant Lab gel bait, pureed tuna, and 50% gelled sucrose solution was measured via multi-choice and no-choice field recruitment studies. Secondly, we discuss experiments testing whether the bait preference of laboratory-raised W. auropuncata varies with their base diet. We tested 4 base diets: (1) lipid rich, (2) protein rich, (3) carbohydrate rich, and (4) a 'complete' diet with lipid, protein, and carbohydrates offered as a buffet. Overall, we found that laboratory colonies differed from wild W. auropunctata in their foraging behaviors in no-choice and multi choice experiments, particularly in their levels of recruitment to the Hawaii Ant Lab gel bait. This contrast indicates that experimental trials may give misleading indications of potential outcomes of field trials. Further research is needed on optimal laboratory diets for laboratory-reared ant colonies. However, our results suggest that behavioral differences may be mitigated if colonies are maintained on a nutritionally limited diet while conducting laboratory experiments.",

We examined whether W. auropunctata is repelled by bait formulations containing this compound and whether the addition of torula yeast (Candida utilis Lodder; Saccharomycetales: Saccharomycetaceae) increased palatability of these baits. Wasmannia auropunctata was found to be repelled by (S)-methoprene concentrations as low as 0.25% regardless of formulation. The addition of torula yeast (3% by weight) significantly increased worker recruitment to baits with and without (S)-methoprene.

    "abstract": "The islands of remote Polynesia (east of Rotuma, Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand) have long been thought to contain few, if any, native ants. The findings of recent sediment core studies, however, challenge this conventional wisdom and indicate some species may be native. The majority of ant species in remote Polynesia, however, are introductions from tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Despite this diversity of origins, and the lack of a common coevolutionary history in the region, patterns of organization in remote Polynesian ant communities are generally similar to those observed in coevolved continental areas. The distribution of ant species across Polynesia is consistent with a primary mechanism of anthropogenic introductions, with the availability of suitable habitat as a secondary mechanism. The species-area relationship for better-collected Polynesian islands reveals these islands are depauperate compared to Melanesian islands with endemic species. Four out of five of the \"world's worst\" invasive ant species are present in remote Polynesia. Recent studies have documented how range expansions of such ant species have had detrimental effects on native arthropod populations, although the overall effects of introduced ants per se on naive endemic island arthropods may never be known with certainty. Considering the relatively fragile nature of island ecosystems, and the potential transformative effects of invasive ants on arthropod communities, vigilance is required to prevent the spread of invasive ant species across Polynesia.",

    "abstract": "The islands of remote Polynesia contain ant faunas that have been largely introduced anthropogenically. I employed nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination analyses to evaluate patterns of ant species assembly on 42 islands across remote Polynesia. Patterns on islands in the Hawaiian archipelago were distinctly separate from those of more southerly islands. Patterns on high islands were distinctly separate from those of atolls and low-lying islands. Patterns on small islets on the barrier reefs of high islands were more similar to those of distant atolls than those of the nearby high islands. Latitude and elevation were most strongly correlated with ordination axes; area and longitude were weakly correlated with ordination axes. Patterns are consistent with human-assisted dispersal through long-distance shipping as a primary vector of colonization, and with a greater diversity of habitat types with increasing island elevation. Similar results were obtained when a subset of 19 islands that had been more thoroughly surveyed was analyzed. I also examined patterns in species composition among communities (within islands) on three French Polynesian islands (Bora Bora, Huahine, and Moorea). On all three islands, sites grouped together distinctly in ordination space as a function of the dominant ant species. A substantial number of species pairs co-occurred less frequently than predicted by chance. Although interspecific competition appears to be important in structuring ant communities within islands, habitat affinities probably also play a role.",

    "abstract": "Phorid flies in the genus Pseudacteon are solitary parasitoids of ants. Development occurs inside the head capsule of the host worker, killing the ant in the process. Pseudacteon flies may also have relatively large indirect effects on colony-level foraging and interspecific competition, as the presence of a single phorid can modify the behavior of hundreds of workers. Two Solenopsis fire ant species from South America, Solenopsis invicta Buren and Solenopsis richteri Forel, are serious pests in their introduced range in the United States. The high population densities of these two exotic ants may be due in part to an escape from natural enemies. Pseudacteon phorid flies from South America are being evaluated as classical biological control agents of imported fire ants in North America. Laboratory studies of one Pseudacteon species, Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier, and its interactions with S. invicta, revealed that the presence of this phorid decreased food retrieval by as much as 50%. We have imported select Pseudacteon species from Brazil and Argentina to the United States for laboratory evaluation, and are currently mass-rearing and releasing two species, P. tricuspis and Pseudacteon curvatus Borgmeier at multiple sites in the southeastern United States. In northern Florida, we established the first field population of P. tricuspis in October 1997. This species now covers approximately 8,100 square kilometers in Florida, and is continuing to expand its range and increase in abundance. Longterm monitoring of sites with and without flies will elucidate the magnitude of the effect of these parasitoids on target fire ant and associated arthropod populations. Pseudacteon flies and other natural enemies will not eradicate imported fire ants in North America, but may reduce fire ant densities.",

However, much is still unknown about how organizations seeking to promote natural resource conservation can effectively inspire, support, and help maintain community action over time. To address this gap, we explored factors associated with resident engagement in control of the invasive little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata) in Hawaii, with a focus on the role of neighborhood social capital (i.e. norms, reciprocity, and relations) in affecting action. Based on data derived from a survey of 246 residents and regression models, we found that increased neighbor interaction, fear of social sanctions from neighbors, and several psychosocial variables were associated with resident action to control the little fire ant. We suggest that organizations seeking to motivate resident engagement in invasive species control may benefit from building social norms and enhancing neighborhood interaction.",

    "abstract": "Encouraging motivated landowners to not only engage in conservation action on their own property but also to recruit others may enhance effectiveness of conservation on private lands. Landowners may only engage in such recruitment if they believe their neighbors care about the conservation issue, will positively respond to their conservation efforts, and are likely to take action for the conservation cause. We designed a series of microinterventions that can be added to community meetings to change these beliefs to encourage landowner engagement in recruitment of others. The microinterventions included neighbor discussion, public commitment making, collective goal setting, and increased observability of contributions to the conservation cause. In a field experiment, we tested whether adding microinterventions to traditional knowledge\u0010transfer outreach meetings changed those beliefs so as to encourage landowners in Hawaii to recruit their neighbors for private lands conservation. We delivered a traditional outreach meeting about managing the invasive little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata) to 5 communities and a traditional outreach approach with added microinterventions to 5 other communities. Analysis of pre\u0010 and post\u0010surveys of residents showed that compared with the traditional conservation outreach approach, the microinterventions altered a subset of beliefs that landowners had about others. These microinterventions motivated reputationally minded landowners to recruit and coordinate with other residents to control the invasive fire ant across property boundaries. Our results suggest integration of these microinterventions into existing outreach approaches will encourage some landowners to facilitate collective conservation action across property boundaries.",

We quantified the effects of Solenopsis papuana, an invasive thief ant that is widespread in Hawai\u00aai, on invertebrate communities via an experimental manipulation study. We established six pairs of plots in the Wai'anae Mountains of O'ahu, suppressed S. papuana in half of the plots, and measured the responses of invertebrates 6 months and 1 year later. Leaf litter and pitfall sampling revealed that ground-dwelling invertebrate communities were highly invaded, with native species comprising 24% of the taxa and only\t~\t1-2% of the individuals captured. Relatively few taxonomic groups increased significantly in abundance following suppression of S. papuana, and responses were generally inconsistent between the two sampling periods. Significant increases in species richness in ant-suppressed plots were more common, particularly in pitfall samples. Most of the significant changes involved non-native species, but several native species also appear to be impacted by S. papuana. Although statistically significant responses were relatively uncommon, nearly all taxonomic groups exhibited non-significant increases in abundance and species richness in response to S. papuana suppression, and there were no significant decreases in either abundance or species richness for any taxonomic group. This suggests that in their current highly invaded states, mesic forest ground-dwelling invertebrate communities are broadly but relatively weakly affected by S. papuana. This conclusion may be tempered by the difficulty of accurately measuring effects on rare species, many of which may now be absent from these communities.",

    "note": "Part of FORMIS 13; from-DPW, verified-DPW.",
    "abstract": "The name 'crazy ants' often refers to various species of formicine ants that are characterized by erratic running when disturbed. Some species can develop extremely large populations that can dominate landscapes. Two of these species, the yellow crazy ant and the Caribbean, or Rasberry [sic], crazy ant with their extremely large numbers and scurrying behavior are spectacular to watch until they start to crawl all over you.  The yellow crazy ant, Anoplolepis gracilipes, formerly known as Anoplolepis longipes, is thought to be from Africa or tropical Asia. It thrives in moist tropical lowlands and has invaded many South Pacific islands. Successful eradication of this invasive ant has been reported from several sites in Australia. Another eradication project is being conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on Johnston Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, which is located about 825 miles west-southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. The refuge provides critical, rat-free habitat for central Pacific sea bird populations. While designated a wildlife refuge in 1926, the atoll was also a military installation since 1934, being used for submarine and aircraft refueling, nuclear weapons testing, and chemical weapons storage and disposal. By 2005, virtually all buildings were razed and military personnel removed. In 2010, a 90 acre yellow crazy ant infestation was found on one (Johnston Island) of the four islands that make up the atoll. By 2011 the contiguous infestation had increased to 120 acres and a 0.2 acre satellite infestation was also discovered. The USFWS has been sending teams of four or five volunteers to try to eradicate the ants. Because of the remote location logistical support is challenging, with teams and supplies being transported by ship (3 day one-way trip) approximately every six months, and communication to Honolulu is limited. Current attempts to control the yellow crazy ant include using ant bait consisting of canned cat food and dinotefuran, an EPA 'reduced-risk insecticide'. In January of 2012 less than 1% of the sampling sites had yellow crazy ants. It was observed that nest initiation by the ground nesting red-tailed tropicbird had increased with the decline in yellow crazy ants. However in April, yellow crazy ants were found at 11% of the sampling locations, thus monitoring and treatment will continue.  The Caribbean crazy ant, Nylanderia cf. pubens, and the Rasberry crazy ant, Nylanderia near pubens, have inundated landscapes in parts of Florida and Texas, respectively. They also have been found in Louisiana and Mississippi. Recent taxonomic and genetic studies indicate that Caribbean and Rasberry crazy ants are the same pest species. Monthly sampling of nests in Gainesville, Florida revealed that the presence of male alates was most prevalent from October to February. High numbers of female dealates and queens were easily observed in January to March, while brood was not consistently evident during that time period. Bait evaluations on laboratory colonies of the Caribbean crazy ant showed consistent colony death with gel bait containing imidacloprid (MaxForce\u00c6 Quantum) diluted in sucrose solution, and granular baits containing hydramethylnon (MaxForce\u00c6 Complete) and abamectin (Advance\u00c6 Carpenter Ant Bait). Various bait formulations containing the insect growth regulators pyriproxyfen or (S)-methoprene caused average reductions in brood of over 80%. However reductions were not consistent across colonies and thus not significantly different from controls. In the search for biological control agents, RNA sequences from Caribbean crazy ants collected from various regions of Florida were surveyed for pathogens. Three replicating sequences of viral origin were detected indicating potential virus infections in the crazy ants and the need for further characterization (Valles et al. 2012).

Here, we integrate molecular and morphological data to recognize species boundaries in Brachymyrmex and to guide its long-overdue revision. Specifically, we (1) redefine the limits of all described species, subspecies, and varieties based on intra- and interspecific morphological variation in workers; (2) document this variation quantitatively by constructing morphospace occupation and statistically analyzing measurements; (3) synthesize our findings on diagnostic traits in a dichotomous, illustrated identification key; and (4) examine the significance of our morphological identification system with molecular evidence from four gene fragments (EF1aEF1, EF1aEF2, WG, and COI). We recognize 40 species, of which four are new to science: Brachymyrmex bahamensis, Brachymyrmex bicolor, Brachymyrmex iridescens, and Brachymyrmex sosai. Furthermore, Brachymyrmex attenuatus and Brachymyrmex bonariensis are raised to species, and we propose 25 new synonyms. Morphometrics indicated that even poorly distinguishable species pairs show statistically significant differences in some traits, and that taxonomically problematic cases relate to taxa that demonstrate large intraspecific trait variance. Our molecular analysis supports the monophyly of the genus based on increased taxon sampling, and of the 19 species that were included 18 were retrieved as monophyletic. The single case of incongruence was also flagged in morphological analyses and requires extended geographic sampling before it can be resolved. In conclusion, the molecular work corroborates the morphologically recognized species boundaries. We also document the presence of worker dimorphism and putative worker-queen intercastes in several Brachymyrmex species, which indicates that the genus may present a promising study system to understand caste evolution in ants.          *[ Louisiana misspelled Lousiana; Vanuatu misspelled Vanatu.]",

We test this basic assumption by conducting a detailed genetic analysis of 4 native & 6 introduced populations with 5 to 15 microsatellite loci & one mitochondrial gene.  In contrast to the assumption that native populations consist of family-based colonies with related individuals who are aggressive toward members of other colonies, we found that native populations also form supercolonies, and are effectively unicolonial.  Moreover, just as in introduced populations, the relatedness between nestmates is not distinguishable from zero in these native range supercolonies.  Genetic differentiation between native supercolonies was very high for both nuclear & mitochondrial markers, indicating extremely limited gene flow between supercolonies.  The only important difference between the native & introduced populations was that supercolonies were several orders of magnitude smaller in the native range (25-500 m).  This size difference has important consequences for our understanding of the evolution & stability of unicolonial structures, because the relatively small size of supercolonies in the native range implies that competition can occur between supercolonies, which can act as a break on the spread of selfish mutants by eliminating supercolonies harboring them.]",

We also examine how urbanization affects trophic interactions involving ants, including mutualistic interactions with hemipterans, & how this affects the ecosystem service of pest control in cities.  We found that the potential for ants to provide ecosystem services in urban areas depends on how the ant community is affected by urbanization & the resulting species composition.  In some cases, the remaining species are highly effective, but in other cases, the most efficient species decline or are replaced by less efficient species as urbanization proceeds.  Because these services depend on the structure of ant communities, which, in turn, is predicted to be altered by climate change, we also examine the effect of climate change on ant communities in the urban environment, including interactions between urbanization & climate change.  The ants that persist in urban environments are largely those with broader temperature ranges & higher heat tolerance, whether by increasing the minimum or maximum temperature that the ants can tolerate.

    "abstract": "More than 60 species of arthropods were found associated with Miconia calvescens at two Brazilian sites in a one-year survey for potential biological control agents within the weed's native range in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Fifty-one insect species were collected, a majority of them phytophagous. Among the sap and cell feeders were two whitefly, a thrips species Heliothrips sp.n. (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), a psyllid Diclidophlebia sp. (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), an aphid species, and six species of leaf hoppers (five were species of Cicadellidae and one species of Flatidae). The psyllid and leaf hoppers appeared to warrant further evaluation, especially for their possible association with a lethal phytoplasm disease. Defoliators causing substantial damage included the leaf-roller Ategumia sp. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and Druentia cf. inscita (Lepidoptera: Mimallonidae), a sawfly Atomacera petroa (Hymenoptera: Argidae), and the leaf-cutter ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa. Stem-boring insects were discovered in low numbers and included an Agrilus sp. (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) that may be capable of killing stems. An Apion sp. (Coleoptera: Brentidae) was found associated with inflorescences. These collections include many species not discovered in earlier surveys of miconia in Brazil and Costa Rica, suggesting that additional potential arthropod agents await discovery in areas not yet explored.   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)          *[Intense defoliating activity by A. sexdens rubropilosa leaf cutting ants was observed at Dion\u00ccsio, Brazil.  The ants were also seen harvesting fruits of M. calvescens.  The attack of this ant species was observed throughout the year at both Brazilian sites.  Unfortunately, despite the significant damage to miconia this species has no potential as a biocontrol agent of M. calvescens, since it is well known as a major generalist crop pest attacking most dicotyledons cultivated in Brazil.]",

    "abstract": "Invasive species eradication and control are considered vital components of the conservation, restoration, and management of many native ecosystems. Invasive ants, which are notoriously difficult to eradicate, can cause catastrophic changes in ecosystems and are aggressive colonists. Here we report the eradication and control of two widely distributed invasive ants and subsequent unanticipated effects on arthropod and avian communities. We used a paired experimental design that included 1 year of baseline data collection, to test the effects of the formicide hydramethylnon on abundances of two ant species on two pairs of offshore islets. Pheidole megacephala was eradicated from the treated islet in pair 1 and was not detected during 2003-2008. On pair 2 Solenopsis geminata numbers declined, but the species remained present. Target ant densities remained high on untreated islets. Application of hydramethylnon reduced numbers of alien cockroaches (Order: Blattaria), but we did not detect effects on other non-target arthropods. The eradication of P. megacephala was followed by dynamic compositional changes in the ant community, including the apparent colonization by three species (S. geminata, Tetramorium bicarinatum and Anoplolepis gracilipes) previously undetected on the islet. One of these, A. gracilipes, underwent a rapid range expansion during 2006-2008 which corresponded with reduced seabird nesting success. We conclude that hydramethylnon can be used effectively to eradicate P. megacephala. However, ant eradications can have detrimental effects on ecosystems and the potential for subsequent colonization of sites by other ant species that may be more harmful and more difficult to eradicate needs to be considered.",

    "abstract": "Hawaii has a single group of native bees belonging to the genus Hylaeus (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) and known collectively as Hawaiian yellow-faced bees. The majority of the 63 species have experienced significant declines in range and population. In 2016, seven species received federal protection under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Competitors and predators, such as invasive bees, wasps and ants, are thought to be important drivers of range reductions and population declines, especially at lower elevations where more non-native species occur. We evaluated the effects of invasive ants on nesting Hylaeus anthracinus using artificial nest blocks that allowed us to track nest construction and development. The blocks were placed in pairs at 22 points encompassing three sites on the north and east sides of Oahu. One block in each pair was treated with a sticky barrier to prevent access by ants, while the other block remained untreated. From December 2015 to December 2016, we monitored 961 individual nests in the blocks. Seventy percent of nests in control blocks were invaded by ants. Nests in treated blocks were more likely to produce at least one adult than nests in untreated blocks (38% vs. 14%, respectively). In untreated blocks, ants were the most common cause of nest mortality followed by lack of development, displacement (primarily by the competitor Pachodynerus nasidens) and presumed pathogens. The invasive ant, Ochetellus glaber was the only observed nest predator, although the big-headed ant, Pheidole megacephala was also present. Hylaeus anthracinus inhabits coastal strand habitat which occurs in a narrow band just above the high tide line. Nests at one site were destroyed due to a high wave event, highlighting this species' vulnerability to sea level rise. Additionally, no adult bees or nests were observed at the points where yellow crazy ants, Anoplolepis gracilipes were established. An increased understanding of the factors limiting Hawaii\u0019s yellow-faced bees will provide information for future conservation efforts that may include landscape-scale ant control, habitat restoration and translocations.

    "abstract": "Invasive ants are a significant conservation concern and can have far-reaching effects in ecosystems they invade. We used the experimental control of ant numbers on two pairs of small (<5 ha) offshore islets dominated by either the big-headed ant, Pheidole megacephala or the tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata to investigate the influence of these species on seabird hatching success, fledging success and weight. Limited unpublished observations of both ant species attacking nesting seabirds exist, but the frequency of attacks or how they affect seabird growth and survival are unknown. Island-wide treatments with hydramethylnon resulted in the eradication of P. megacephala and the temporary reduction of S. geminata densities. No difference in hatching success, growth, or fledging success of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), a common colonial nesting seabird in the Hawaiian Islands was observed on the pair of islets dominated by P. megacephala. On islets dominated by S. geminata, ant control resulted in a temporary increase in fledging uccess. Injury frequency increased dramatically on the untreated islet (8.3-100%) while remaining the same on the treated islet (27-38%). Severely injured chicks (i.e., chicks that lost >20% of tissue on their feet) weighed significantly less than uninjured chicks and did not fledge. It is unclear if the chicks were being preyed upon or stung in defense of nearby ant colonies. Radical changes in invasive ant populations have been noted, and booming ant populations could cause short-term, but widespread damage to seabird colonies. The negative effects of invasive ants on seabirds may be difficult to detect, and therefore unknown or underestimated throughout the world where the two groups overlap.",

    "abstract": "Yellow crazy ants (Anoplolepis gracilipes) are a significant threat to biodiversity due to a rapidly expanding range and the potential to disrupt ecosystem interactions at multiple trophic levels. Extirpation of ground-nesting seabirds subsequent to yellow crazy ant invasion has been reported anecdotally. Yellow crazy ant control is difficult and resulting positive effects on nesting seabirds is undocumented. We report the effects of ant invasion and subsequent control on burrow-nesting seabirds following the invasion of more than half of a 1.25-ha wedge-tailed shearwater (Ardenna pacifica) colony located on eastern O'ahu. The number of active seabird burrows in invaded areas dropped from 125 in 2006 to 6 in 2010, with no corresponding decline in active burrows in adjacent, uninvaded areas. Ant control efforts in 2011 reduced ant densities by more than 97% and resulted in a substantial increase in active burrows (43 in 2011). In invaded areas, burrows appeared to be abandoned by adults prior to egg-laying. Chicks surviving in invaded areas exhibited mild to severe developmental abnormalities, and overall had shorter culmens, tarsi and wingchords, smaller eye diameters, and lower weights than chicks outside invaded areas. We conclude that yellow crazy ants constitute a significant, and likely underestimated, risk to ground-nesting seabirds. Loss of seabird nesting colonies can have significant effects on nutrient inputs, and can bring about shifts in plant communities and faunal composition. Range expansion of yellow crazy ants is expected and ant/seabird interactions are likely to increase.",

    "abstract": "Invasive ants can cause major disruptions in native ecosystems. Ant eradication methods without significant non-target effects are needed to stop incipient invasions and to aid in ecosystem restoration. Successful ant eradications are rare and there is very little understanding of the effects of ant eradication methods, such as the use of formicides, on non-target species. Here we attempted to control and possibly eradicate the invasive tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata, from a small islet using the formicide Maxforce (active ingredient: hydramethylnon), and to quantify the non-target effects on an almost exclusively alien ground-dwelling arthropod community. S. geminata abundance was reduced and the species was not detected on bait cards for 12 months post-treatment. The abundance of another non-target invasive ant that was primarily detected in pitfall traps, Tetramoruim <sic> bicarinatum, declined in pitfall traps following treatment, but seemed to be excluded from bait cards by S. geminata. Total ant abundance did not return to original levels until more than 12 months post-treatment. Populations of alien cockroaches (Order Blattaria) and crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) were negatively affected by the treatment. We conclude that Maxforce can be used to control small infestations of S. geminata and T. bicarinatum effectively; however we recommend it be used cautiously due to the potential ecological cost to non-target species. Use in areas where infestations are small and isolated will maximize the likelihood of success while minimizing non-target effects.",

    "abstract": "Benefits of trophobiosis between Pheidole megacephala (F.) and Coccus viridis (Green) were studied in exclusion experiments in coffee. Treatments consisted of trees with ants and no scale natural enemies, no ants and no natural enemies, natural enemies and no ants, and ants and natural enemies. Ant foraging activity and scale populations were monitored weekly. There were no significant differences in green scale populations between ant-infested and ant-free trees when natural enemies were excluded. This demonstrated that scale survival was not due to sanitational benefits from the removal of honeydew by ants. Scale populations on ant-free trees with natural enemies were significantly different from those on ant-infested trees with natural enemies after 119 d. Ants had a positive influence on green scale survival by interfering with or preying on natural enemies. Ant foraging activity, and scale, coccinellid, and parasitoid densities were monitored on ant-infested and ant-free trees in a second experiment using different ant exclusion techniques. The results were a significant positive interaction between ants and scales and a significant negative interaction between ants and coccinellid larvae. There were no significant interactions between ants and adult coccinellids or parasitoids. Green scales declined after 50 d and were not present after 70 d on trees from which ants were excluded, but scales remained on ant-infested trees.   This decline followed increases in four species of larval coccinellids. It was concluded that ants were necessary for the survival of C. viridis in coffee. In the absence of ants, natural enemies, primarily larval coccinellids, eliminated C. viridis from trees.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria, which are very common in arthropods and nematodes. Wolbachia infection may affect host reproduction through feminization, parthenogenesis, male-killing, cytoplasmic incompatibility and increased fecundity. Previous studies showing discrepancies between the phylogenies of Wolbachia and its arthropod hosts indicate that infection is frequently lost, but the causes of symbiont extinction have so far remained elusive. Here, we report data showing that colonization of new habitats is a possible mechanism leading to the loss of infection. The presence and prevalence of Wolbachia were studied in three native and eight introduced populations of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile. The screening shows that the symbiont is common in the three native L. humile populations analyzed. In contrast, Wolbachia was detected in only one of the introduced populations. The loss of infection associated with colonization of new habitats may result from drift (founder effect) or altered selection pressures in the new habitat. Furthermore, a molecular phylogeny based on sequences of the Wolbachia wsp gene indicates that L. humile has been infected by a single strain. Horizontal transmission of the symbiont may be important in ants as suggested by the sequence similarity of strains in the three genera Linepithema, Acromyrmex, and Solenopsis native from South and Central America.",

Reconciliation ecology discovers how to modify & diversify anthropogenic habitats so that they harbor a wide variety of species.  It develops management techniques that allow humans to share their geographical range with wild species.  The linear response of diversity to area among provinces appears to explain the total absence of certain groups of native species on small continents, such as ponerine & cerapachyine ants on Hawaii.  Two studies give us a picture of the diversity of these subfamilies in tropical southeast Asia, Oceania, & New Zealand.  These fall nearly on a straight line in arithmetic space & enable us to estimate the area of a province that would have a single species.

Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, rank among the most successful invasive species, native to South America, they have invaded broad areas worldwide.

We use a genetic algorithm approach to ecological niche modeling based on high-resolution remote-sensing data to examine the roles of niche similarity & difference in predicting invasions by this species.  Our comparisons support a picture of general conservatism of the species' ecological characteristics, in spite of distinct geographic & community contexts.  Georeferenced localities, on which we based our models, were extracted from museum specimen locality records, personal collections, scientific literature, & field surveys (for the full set of localities see the appendix in Roura-Pascual et al. 2004).]",

Hawaii and the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICT) are known for their island isolation and fragile ecosystem. An incursion of red imported fire ants could spread rapidly and go undetected. Detection in Hawaii is done through survey programs through funds provided by USDA/ APHIS/ PPQ to the Hawaii Departlnent of Agriculture. The Hawaii Ant Group, established in 1999, provides a comprehensive and cooperative approach to deal with new ant threats. They have created a state prevention plan, provided the information for a change in quarantine policy for ants intercepted from commodities destined to the State of Hawaii, acquired funds, and participated in a workshop in New Zealand to initiate a regional approach to prevention. In October 2002, the Global Invasive Species Program (GISP) convened in Hawaii. Participants from PICT were in unanimous agreement that RIFA seem to pose a huge threat to Pacific island biodiversity, island economies and culture, and human health. A workshop held by the Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) in Auckland, New Zealand in September2003, resulted in the compilation of a draft Pacific Ant Prevention Plan (PAPP) that encompassed RIFA and other exotic invasive ants that have demonstrated negative impacts. Given the eradication difficulties of many invasive alien ant species (esp RIFA) obviously prevention of entry is of utmost importance and the highest priority. Given many preventative biosecurity measures may take time to implement on a regional basis the PICT region also need to be prepared for an incursion. The PAPP proposal outlines the necessary framework for both the prevention of entry and the prevention of establisllment. As of March 2004, the Pacific Plant Protection Organization and Regional Technical Meeting for Plant Protection was held in Suva, Fiji. The Pacific Ant Group which worked on the plan presented this plan at the meeting.

    "abstract": "Invasive ants can influence abundance and diversity of insect pollinators, and this effect may be expected to be especially strong on oceanic islands. We examined abundance of native Hylaeus bees and patterns of flower visitation to three native Hawaiian plant species (Leptecophylla tameiameiae, Santalum haleakalae, and Geranium cuneatum) in presence and absence of invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in the subalpine shrubland of Haleakal\u0001 volcano. Native bees, nonnative honeybees, and microlepidoptera were responsible for the majority of visits to flowers of the three plant species. Ants visited flowers of S. haleakalae and G. cuneatum relatively commonly in ant-invaded zones but were less common or absent on flowers of L. tameiameiae in the same zones. Zones with ants had fewer Hylaeus bees in yellow pan traps than the zone without ants, and overall flower visitation rates to one plant species, G. cuneatum, were six times lower in sites containing ants. In one of two observation years, flower visitation to L. tameiameiae was also reduced in sites containing ants. Results suggest that Argentine ants may cause a reduction of native Hylaeus bee abundances; however, other factors correlated with elevation cannot be ruled out as the cause of differences in Hylaeus abundances across our sites.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to provide a detailed taxonomic resource for identifying and studying ants in the genus Pheidole that have established beyond their native ranges. There is an increasing need for systematists to study taxa of specific concern to 21\u201aW century environmental, food security and public health challenges. Systematics has an important role to play in both the theoretical and applied disciplines of invasion biology. Few invaders impact terrestrial ecosystems more than ants. Among the world\u0019s 100 worst invasive species is the cosmopolitan and highly destructive Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius). Accurate identification of Pheidole megacephala is imperative for the success of screening, management and eradication programs designed to protect native ecosystems from the impacts of this destructive species. However, accurate identification of Pheidole species is difficult because of their taxonomic diversity, dimorphic worker caste and lack of taxonomic resources. Illustrated keys are included, along with the taxonomic history, taxonomic diagnoses, biological notes and risk statements for the 14 most invasive members of the genus. Global distribution maps based on over 14,000 specimen and literature records are presented for each species. These results of this work will facilitate identification of pest species, determination of climatic and habitat requirements, discovery of pest origins, horizon scanning and assessment of invasion pathways. The following new synonym is proposed, with the senior synonym listed first and the junior synonyms in parentheses: Pheidole indica Mayr (= Pheidole teneriffana Forel, and its synonyms Pheidole taina Aguayo and Pheidole voeltzkowii Forel). Pheidole navigans Forel, stat. rev., stat. n. is removed from synonymy and elevated to species rank. It is proposed that records of Pheidole moerens Forel outside of the Mesoamerica and the Caribbean refer instead to Pheidole navigans or other heterospecific taxa in the Pheidole flavens species complex. We propose that the names Pheidole anastasii Emery and Pheidole floridana Emery have been widely misapplied to North American outdoor records of Pheidole bilimeki Mayr. It is suggested that the synonymy of Pheidole lauta Wheeler be transferred from Pheidole floridana Emery to Pheidole bilimeki Mayr.",

Specimens of the species reported here were collected November 2011 from an established colony on Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu, during a survey of the island's ant fauna.  Morphological & genetic analyses revealed these Vanuatu specimens belong to the Neotropical P. flavens group.  The DNA sequence data most closely matched those of 2 specimens previously determined as P. moerens Wheeler and P. flavens Roger.  A closely related taxon currently being treated as P. moerens Wheeler was reported from Hawaii in 2005.  Preliminary morphological analysis suggests that the Vanuatu population reported here represents a different species than the Hawaii P. moerens.  However, a valid species name cannot be confidently applied to either the Hawaii population or the Vanuatu population until a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the flavens-complex is completed.  Species of the Pheidole flavens-complex are occasionally considered pest ants, but have not been documented as causing significant harm to native species, food security or public health.  However, the recent spread of species in this complex across the SE United States, recent introductions to California & Hawaii, & the recent discovery in Vanuatu suggests their potential for human-mediated dispersal & establishment.  We hope that raising awareness of this new incursion will improve the chances of early detection & eradication before the species spreads further into the Pacific Island region.  We provide specimen photographs of the major and minor caste &  a brief diagnosis that can be used to separate this species from other Pheidole species introduced in the Pacific island region, including Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius) & the morphologically similar Pheidole parva.]",

Exploratory data analyses using 11 morphometric characters were performed in a total of 95 samples with 213 specimens from the worldwide range.  They showed that both species are clearly separable in ergatoid males, gynomorphic females, workers, & ergatoid females.  Junior synonyms of Hypoponera punctatissima (Roger, 1859) were established by type investigation: Hypoponera androgyna (Roger, 1859), Hypoponera tarda (Charsley, 1877), Hypoponera punctatissima r. jugata (Forel, 1892), & Hypoponera punctatissima var. exacta (Santschi, 1923).  Junior synonyms of Hypoponera ergatandria (Forel, 1893) were established by type investigation: Hypoponera kalakauae (Forel, 1899), Hypoponera punctatissima var. schauinslandi (Emery, 1899), Hypoponera dulcis var. aemula (Santschi, 1911), & Hypoponera ergatandria subsp. bondroiti (Forel, 1911).  Both species are highly sympatric in Europe with one known example to occur in the  same greenhouse.  Not a single nest sample in the global material contained workers of both H. punctatissima & H. ergatandria & there was also no nest sample containing conflicting ergatoid males or gynomorphic females.  The species obviously maintain separate reproductive cycles under conditions of a broadly sympatric occurrence & developed significant differences in phenology of sexual development, dispersal of alate gynes, habitat selection in the temperate zone, & global distribution.  These data clearly rebut the recent judgement of Bolton & Fisher (2011) '...that the discriminant functions applied by Seifert (2004) do not isolate discrete species, but rather indicate allopatric populations of the same species, or even different eco-morphs of a single species.'  A simple method (providing a complete separation of the 2 species & taking a trained investigator 3 minutes of working time) is presented for males, workers, ergatomorphic females, & gynomorphs.]",

    "abstract": "The world-wide fauna of the genus Cardiocondyla is assessed to have 79 currently recognized species and is subdivided into 14 informal species groups plus three monotypical clades. It is argued that the phylogenetic placement of Cardiocondyla next to the genus Ocymyrmex Emery, 1886 as proposed by Blaimer et al. (2018) is doubtful. The main body of the paper is a species-level taxonomic revision of those six species groups and the one monotypical clade which have their centers of origin in the Oriental and Australasian regions. The fauna of this area comprises 26 species eleven of which are described as new: Cardiocondyla schulzi n.sp., C. argentea n.sp., C. semiargentea n.sp., C. argyrotricha n.sp., C. latifrons n.sp., C. micropila n.sp., C. allonivalis n.sp., C. excavata n.sp., C. goroka n.sp., C. subspina n.sp. and C. sulcata n.sp. Recognized as junior synonyms were: Cardiocondyla tsukuyomi Terayama, 1999 and C. breviscapus Seifert, 2003 of C. minutior Forel, 1899 and C. brevispinosa (Donisthorpe, 1948) of C. paradoxa Emery, 1897. Each confirmed species is characterized by verbal descriptions, 18 numerically recorded phenotypic characters, z-stack images in three viewing positions, the key, a differential diagnosis and, if available, a brief life history. Exploratory and hypothesis-driven data analyses of phenotypic characters support the separation of the cryptic species Cardiocondyla minutior Forel, 1899, C. goa Seifert, 2003 and C. tjibodana Karavajev, 1935, two of which have dispersed as tramp species to the New World. Missing development of postzygotic isolation due to very strong prezygotic barriers is indicated in the closely related species Cardiocondyla latifrons n.sp. and C. micropila n.sp. which produce fertile hybrids in laboratory rearings but apparently do not hybridize in a natural context even if nesting in close neighborhood. The strong prezygotic isolation is supposed to be generated by the prevalence of intranidal mating and the difficulty for a mated heterospecific gyne to become accepted in a foreign colony.",

    "abstract": "Species delimitation offered by DNA-based approaches can provide important insights into the natural history and diversity of species, but the cogency of such processes is limited without multigene phylogenies. Recent attempts to barcode various Solenopsidini ant taxa (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae), including the thief ant Solenopsis saudiensis Sharaf & Aldawood, 2011 described from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), were precipitated by the unexpected existence of a closely related species, the Nearctic S. abdita Thompson, 1989 within the S. molesta species complex native to Florida. This finding left the species status of the former uncertain. Here, we investigated the taxonomy and phylogeny of these two species to determine whether or not S. abdita represents a new global tramp species. We inferred a phylogeny of the two species using DNA sequence data from four nuclear genes (Abd-A, EF1\u00b1-F1, EF1\u00b1-F2, and Wingless) and one mitochondrial gene (COI) sampled from populations in Florida, Guatemala, Hawaii, and Saudi Arabia. Both species clustered into one distinct and robust clade. The taxonomy of S. saudiensis was re\u0010examined using morphometrics. A reassessment of the morphological characters used to diagnose the worker and queen castes were consistent with molecular evidence. Based on combined morphological and molecular evidences S. saudiensis is declared as a junior synonym of S. abdita (syn. nov.). In addition, our findings indicate that S. abdita is a novel global tramp species which has a far wider distribution than previously thought and has established itself in many new habitats and different geographic realms.

    "abstract": "Little is known regarding pollination webs involving island coastal plants and pollinators, and roles that nonnative flower visitors may play in these interaction networks. Plant-pollinator observations made in March 2008 and 2009 were used to describe the pollination network for Ka'ena Point, one of Hawai'i\u0019s best-conserved coastal communities. The network includes 15 native plant species, two native bee species, and 26 nonnative insect taxa, forming 119 interactions. Network connectance is 29.4% and weighted nestedness is 17.9, which are similar to values of other dry-habitat, island networks. The network's structure has a core of generalized pollinators plus several more-specialized pollinators. Nearly all plant species interact with two or more generalist pollinators and a variable number of specialists. Small, nonnative bees (Lasioglossum, Ceratina), wasps (Proconura), and flies (mostly Tachinidae) were responsible for 72.7% of flower visits, and they visit five plant species not visited by native bees. The two native visitors were the bees Hylaeus anthracinus and H. longiceps (both proposed as endangered). Hylaeus spp. (especially females) provided 19.8% of flower visits, foraging at high visitation rates and on many species, including the endangered Scaevola coriacea and Sesbania tomentosa. In Hawai'i's coastal habitat, nonnative insects form novel interactions with native species and may maintain an ecosystem\u0019s function following loss of most of the original native pollinators. However, their high visitation rates suggest that the two remaining native Hylaeus species are potentially important pollinators for many of the native plants on which they rely for nectar and pollen resources.          *[Ants visited all plant species & were recorded 945 times out of 2,072 observations of flower visitors across both years.  Ants were removed from the analysis because they are rarely pollinators.  However, other insect interactions in the community could be affected by ants.  Ants could be removing floral resources or physically interfering with pollinators on flowers & could decrease pollinator populations in the habitat.]",

    "abstract": "The diets of sympatric rodents partially define their realized niches. Identifying items in stomachs of introduced rodents helps determine rodents' trophic positions and species most at risk of consumption. In the Hawaiian Islands, which lacked rodents prior to human arrival, three rodents (Rattus rattus or black rat, R. exulans or Pacific rat, Mus musculus or house mouse) commonly coexist in native habitats where they consume a wide range of plants and animals. These three rodent species were trapped in montane forest for 2.5 years; their stomach contents were analyzed to determine short-term diets (n = 12-95 indiv. per species), and isotopic fractions of \u00a515N and \u00a513C in their bone collagen were analyzed to further estimate their trophic positions (n = 11-20 indiv. per species). For all three species, >75 % of individuals had plants and >90 % had arthropods in their stomachs, and significant differences in mean relative abundances were found for food items in stomachs among all three rodents. Rodents may be dispersing some native and non-native seeds, including the highly invasive Clidemia hirta. Most identifiable arthropods in rodent stomachs were non-native, and no stomachs contained birds, snails, or lizards. The \u00a515N and \u00a513C signatures were consistent with trophic feeding differences revealed from stomach contents. Dietary niche differentiation by coexisting rodent species is evident in this forest, with Pacific rats being intermediate between the mostly carnivorous house mouse and the mostly herbivorous black rat; such findings can help forecast rodent impacts and direct management efforts in ecosystems where these invasive animals coexist.   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)          *[Only 4 species of arthropod were found intact in rodent stomachs, & these included Solenopsis papuana (Papuan thief ant).]",

    "abstract": "The previous identification of 2,5-dimethyl-3-(3-methylbutyl)pyrazine as the mandibular alarm pheromone of the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger), has been found to be incorrect. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of ant extracts suggested the correct structure to be the regioisomer 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine, which was confirmed by comparison with the synthetic pyrazine. GC/MS analysis also revealed the presence of an additional disubstituted alkylpyrazine which was identified as 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine. Headspace sampling of confined ants with SPME and Porapak Q followed by GC/MS analysis showed 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine as the major volatile released by W. auropunctata workers while 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine was only detected in trace amounts. In laboratory bioassays, W. auropunctata workers were attracted and arrested by both pyrazines, although the results were not always consistent. Synthetic pyrazines generally attracted as many W. auropunctata workers as were attracted to a single crushed ant. However, higher numbers of W. auropunctata were arrested by crushed ant treatments than by synthetic pyrazines in all bioassays but one.

    "abstract": "*[Wolbachia is a genus of bacterial endosymbionts that impacts the breeding systems of their hosts.  We examined the extent to which these endosymbionts are detected in routine DNA barcoding, assessed their impact upon the insect sequence divergence & identification accuracy, & considered the variation present in Wolbachia COI.  Using both standard PCR assays (Wolbachia surface coding protein - wsp), & bacterial COI fragments, we found evidence of Wolbachia in insect total genomic extracts created for DNA barcoding library construction.  When over-2.2 million insect COI trace files were examined on the Barcode of Life Datasystem, Wolbachia COI was present in 0.16% of the cases.  We conclude that the presence of the Wolbachia DNA in total genomic extracts made from insects is unlikely to compromise the accuracy of the DNA barcode library.  In fact, the ability to query this DNA library (the database & the extracts) for endosymbionts is one of the ancillary benefits of such a large scale endeavor.  It is our conclusion that regular assays for Wolbachia presence & type can, and should, be adopted by large scale insect barcoding initiatives. In ants, Wolbachia strains from New World collections were shown to differ from those in ants from elsewhere.   For instance, Wolbachia COI from a Costa Rican ant differed by 2 & 4 base pairs respectively to those from bacteria hosted by ants in Papua New Guinea & Mauritius. In ants collected on the island of Mauritius, we tested 438 ant specimens from 57 species for Wolbachia using the wsp assay & found that approximately 1/3 of these specimens & species tested positive (116/438 specimens = 26.5%, 18/57 species = 31.5%).  Of the total ant specimens sequenced from the Mauritius project (1111), only 4 bacterial COI sequences were recovered (0.36%).  In a smaller set of ants collected in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, we found that 178 of 282 DNA extracts from 5 of 7 species were infected (63%, 71%); however we recovered no bacterial COI from this group using standard insect barcoding procedures.]",

    "abstract": "The little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), is an invasive ant that forms supercolonies when it successfully invades new areas.  W. auropunctata was first reported in Hawaii in 1999, and it has since invaded a variety of agricultural sites, including nurseries, orchards, and pastures.  Amdro (hydramethylnon; in bait stations), Esteem (pyriproxyfen; broadcast bait), and Conserve (spinosad; ground spray) were tested for their efficacy against W. auropunctata in a rambutan, Nephelium lappaceum L. and mangosteen, Garcinia mangostana L., orchard by making treatments every 2 wk for 16 wk.  Relative estimates of ant numbers in plots was determined by transect sampling using peanut butter-baited sticks.  Significant treatment effects were observed on weeks 13-17, with reductions in ant counts occurring in the Amdro and Esteem treatments.  During this period, the reduction in ant numbers from pretreatment counts averaged 47.1 and 92.5% in the Amdro and Esteem plots, respectively, whereas ant numbers in the untreated control plots increased by 185.9% compared with pretreatment counts.  Conserve did not cause a reduction in ant counts as applied in our experiment.  No plots for any of the treatments achieved 100% reduction.  Pseudococcidae were counted on branch terminals at 4-wk intervals.  The two predominant species, Nipaecoccus nipae (Maskell) and Nipaecoccus viridis (Newstead) were significantly lower in the Amdro and Esteem treatments on week 16 compared with controls.  Many W. auropunctata were found nesting in protected sites in the orchard trees, which may have compromised the ground-based control methods.  Absolute density estimates from shallow core samples taken from the orchard floor indicated the W. auropunctata supercolony exceeded 244 million ants and 22.7 kg wet weight per ha.

    "abstract": "Disruption of Argentine ant trail following and reduced ability to forage (measured by bait location success) was achieved after presentation of an oversupply of trail pheromone, (Z)-9-hexadecenal. Experiments tested single pheromone point sources and dispersion of a formulation in small field plots. Ant walking behavior was recorded and digitized by using video tracking, before and after presentation of trail pheromone. Ants showed changes in three parameters within seconds of treatment: (1) Ants on trails normally showed a unimodal frequency distribution of walking track angles, but this pattern disappeared after presentation of the trail pheromone; (2) ants showed initial high trail integrity on a range of untreated substrates from painted walls to wooden or concrete floors, but this was significantly reduced following presentation of a point source of pheromone; (3) the number of ants in the pheromone-treated area increased over time, as recruitment apparently exceeded departures. To test trail disruption in small outdoor plots, the trail pheromone was formulated with carnuba wax-coated quartz laboratory sand (1 g quartz sand/0.2 g wax/1 mg pheromone). The pheromone formulation, with a half-life of 30 h, was applied by rotary spreader at four rates (0, 2.5, 7.5, and 25 mg pheromone/m2) to 1- and 4-m2 plots in Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii. Ant counts at bait cards in treated plots were significantly reduced compared to controls on the day of treatment, and there was a significant reduction in ant foraging for 2 days. These results show that trail pheromone disruption of Argentine ants is possible, but a much more durable formulation is needed before nest-level impacts can be expected.",

Argentine ant trail pheromone, (Z)-9-hexadecenal, was formulated as a micro-encapsulated sprayable particle and applied against Argentine ant populations in 400 m2 field plots in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. A widely dispersed point source strategy for trail pheromone disruption was used. Traffic rates of ants in bioassays of treated filter paper, protected from rainfall and sunlight, indicated the presence of behaviorally significant quantities of pheromone being released from the formulation for up to 59 days. The proportion of plots, under trade wind conditions (2-3 m s-1), with visible trails was reduced for up to 14 days following treatment, and the number of foraging ants at randomly placed tuna-bait cards was similarly reduced. The success of these trail pheromone disruption trials in a natural ecosystem highlights the potential of this method for control of invasive ant species in this and other environments.",

    "abstract": "Argentine ant trail pheromone disruption, using continuous release of the trail pheromone compound (Z)-9-hexadecanal, reduces the incidence of trails and foraging rates of field populations. However, little is known about the concentrations of pheromone required for successful disruption. We hypothesized that higher pheromone quantities would be necessary to disrupt larger ant populations. To test this, we laid a 30-cm long base trail of (Z)-9-hexadecanal on a glass surface at low and high rates (1 and 100 pg/cm) (Trail 1), and laid a second, shorter trail (Trail 2, 10 cm long, located 1.5 cm upwind) near the middle of Trail 1 at six rates (1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 pg/cm). We then recorded and digitized movements of individual ants following Trail 1, and derived a regression statistic, r 2, as an index of trail integrity, and also recorded arrival success at the other end of the trail (30 cm) near a food supply. Disruption of trails required 100 fold more pheromone upwind, independent of base-trail concentration. This implies that in the field, trail disruption is likely to be less successful against high nt-trail densities (greater concentration of trail pheromone), and more successful against newly formed or weak trails, as could be expected along invasion fronts.",

    "abstract": "Ants are some of the most aggressive and invasive species in the world. With toxic bait systems affecting non-target species, thus not ideal in sensitive ecosystems, new tactics to control ant species are being tested. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta uses recruitment pheromones to organize the retrieval of food resources back to the colony. Z,E-alpha-farnesene is responsible for the orientation of workers along trails. We disrupted worker trail orientation after presenting of an oversupply (30 or 300 \u00b5g) of this compound. Established trails were recorded by overhead webcam and ant positions digitized, before and after presentation of the treatment.   The coefficient of determination or trail integrity statistic, r2 was then calculated. Ants initially showed high linear trail integrity (r2 = 0.75). Within seconds of pheromone presentation, the ants showed little or no further evidence of trail-following behavior (r2 = 0.16-0.49).Our fire ant work follows on from the success of Argentine ant Linepithema humile trail following disruption. A breakdown of trail following integrity has been achieved using (Z)-9-hexadecenal a major component of the trail pheromone. Linepithema humile individuals had high trail following integrity r2 = 0.947 along natural trails before disruption was applied. Integrity dropped (r2 = 0.164) after a point source of pheromone was placed next to the trail. In Hawai'i Volcano National Park, the disruption of L. humile trail formation and a reduction in the number of ants at bait cards lasted for 14 days in the field using a sprayable (multiple point source) microencapsulated trail pheromone formulation. Movies showing the trail disruption phenomenon and the use of machine vision for ant digitization will be demonstrated. Further research is needed to establish the long-term effects and control potential of trail disruption for ants. Negative effects on resource collection, colony size and nest migration are expected.

Despite this, the evidence base has never been holistically synthesised to quantify whether and to what degree non\u0010native ants impact native species diversity. In this study, we performed a meta\u0010analysis of the effects of ant invasion on animal communities. We extracted data from 46 published articles investigating abundance (156 effect sizes) and richness (53 effect sizes) responses of animal taxa to ant invasion in locations relatively unimpacted by other stressors (e.g. human disturbance, other non\u0010native species) to help isolate the effects of invasion. Overall, local animal diversity declined severely, with species abundance and richness lower by 42.79% and 53.56%, respectively, in areas with non\u0010native ants compared with intact uninvaded sites. We then combined responses of individual animal taxa extracted from an article into a single response to represent the \u0018community\u0019 abundance (40 effect sizes) or richness (28 effect sizes) response to non\u0010native ants represented in each article. Local communities decreased substantially in total abundance (52.67%) and species richness (53.47%) in invaded sites. These results highlight non\u0010native ants as the drivers, rather than passengers, of large net\u0010negative reductions to animal community diversity in relatively undisturbed systems around the world, approximately halving local species abundance and richness in invaded areas. Improved international prevention processes, early detection systems harnessing emerging technologies, and well\u0010designed control measures deployable by conservation practitioners are urgently needed if these effects are to be mitigated, prevented or reversed.",

Our approach made these samples amenable to analysis with commonly used next-generation sequencing-based molecular analytic tools, including RAD-tagging & shotgun genome re-sequencing.  First, we used museum ant specimens from 3 species, each with its own reference genome, for RAD-tag mapping.  Were able to use the degraded DNA sequences, which were sequenced in full, to identify duplicate reads & filter them prior to base calling.  Second, we re-sequenced 6 Hawaiian Drosophila species.

    "abstract": "Hawaii is home to over 60 ant species, including five of the six most damaging invasive ants. Although there have been many surveys of ants in Hawaii, the last island-wide hand-collection survey of ants on Oahu was conducted in 1988-1994. In 2012, a timed hand-collection of ants was made at 44 sites in a systematic, roadside survey throughout Oahu. Ants were identified and species distribution in relation to elevation, precipitation and soil type was analyzed. To assess possible convenience sampling bias, 15 additional sites were sampled further from roads to compare with the samples near roads. Twenty-four species of ants were found and mapped; Pheidole megacephala (F.), Ochetellus glaber (Mayr), and Technomyrmex difficilis Forel were the most frequently encountered ants. For six ant species, a logistic regression was performed with elevation, average annual precipitation, and soil order as explanatory variables. O. glaber was found in areas with lower precipitation around Oahu. Paratrechina longicornis (Latrielle) and Tetramorium simillimum (Smith, F.) were found more often in lower elevations and in areas with the Mollisol soil order. Elevation, precipitation, and soil type were not significant sources of variation for P. megacephala, Plagiolepis alluaudi Emery, and T. difficilis. P. megacephala was associated with fewer mean numbers of ants where it occurred. Ant assemblages near and far from roads did not significantly differ. Many species of ants remain established on Oahu, and recent invaders are spreading throughout the island. Mapping ant distributions contributes to continued documentation and understanding of these pests.          *[Monomorium destructor listed in Table 5, not in Table 2.

    "abstract": "Field bioassays with Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) show that the alarm pheromone components 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine both attract and arrest ants in a natural environment. Comparisons between lures containing 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine singly and in blends (10:1 and 100:1) based on W. auropunctata extracts, failed to show differences in the time required to attract a given number of ants. This indicates a lack of synergistic effects between the compounds under these test conditions. A dose response assay with 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine showed maximal ant response to a 1 mg pheromone lure, a dose which remained attractive for 8 days under field conditions. Several of the field experiments included peanut butter baits, a lure currently used for detection. However, ant counts at peanut butter baits were not greater than at controls suggesting that peanut butter does not produce volatiles that attract ants. With the aim of developing management applications, a series of bioassays were conducted with 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine in combination with food baits. A separate assay was conducted with Tanglefoot, a sticky catch material. In feeding bioassays, the alarm pheromone decreased consumption of peanut butter and solutions of protein and sugar. Tanglefoot squares failed to catch W. auropunctata with any of the lures tested. The field responses of W. auropunctata to alarm pheromone lures show a mixed potential for control applications. While the strong attraction and longevity of lures is promising, the inability to increase bait consumption or capture ants with Tanglefoot presents obstacles to using these alarm pheromone components for ant management.

    "abstract": "Clonal reproduction can provide an advantage for invasive species to establish as it can circumvent inbreeding depression which often plagues introduced populations. The world's most widespread invasive ant, Paratrechina longicornis, was previously found to display a double\u0010clonal reproduction system, whereby both males and queens are produced clonally, resulting in separate male and queen lineages, while workers are produced sexually. Under this unusual reproduction mode, inbreeding is avoided in workers as they carry hybrid interlineage genomes. Despite the ubiquitous distribution of P. longicornis, the significance of this reproductive system for the ant's remarkable success remains unclear, as its prevalence is still unknown. Further investigation into the controversial native origin of P. longicornis is also required to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of double\u0010clonal lineages. Here, we examine genetic variation and characterize the reproduction mode of P. longicornis populations sampled worldwide using microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences to infer the ant's putative native range and the distribution of the double\u0010clonal reproductive system. Analyses of global genetic variations indicate that the Indian subcontinent is a genetic diversity hotspot of this species, suggesting that P. longicornis probably originates from this geographical area. Our analyses revealed that both the inferred native and introduced populations exhibit double\u0010clonal reproduction, with queens and males around the globe belonging to two separate, nonrecombining clonal lineages. By contrast, workers are highly heterozygous because they are first\u0010generation interlineage hybrids. Overall, these data indicate a worldwide prevalence of double clonality in P. longicornis and support the prediction that the unusual genetic system may have pre\u0010adapted this ant for global colonization by maintaining heterozygosity in the worker force and alleviating genetic bottlenecks.",

Analyses of mtDNA sequences of 248 P. longicornis workers (one per colony) from 13 geographic regions reveal 2 highly diverged mtDNA clades that co-occur in most of the geographic regions.  These two mtDNA clades are associated with different Wolbachia infection patterns, but are not congruent with patterns of nDNA (microsatellite) variation.  Multilocus sequence typing reveals 2 distinct Wolbachia strains in P. longicornis, namely, wLonA & wLonF.  The evolutionary histories of these 2 strains differ; wLonA appears to be primarily transmitted maternally, & patterns of mtDNA & nDNA variation & wLonA infection status are consistent with a relatively recent Wolbachia-induced selective sweep.  In contrast, the observed patterns of mtDNA variation & wLonF infections suggest frequent horizontal transfer &  losses of wLonF infections.  The lack of nDNA structure among sampled geographic regions coupled with the finding that numerous mtDNA haplotypes are shared among regions implies, that inadvertent long-distance movement through human commerce is common in P. longicornis & has shaped the genetic structure of this invasive ant worldwide.]",

This confirmed that populations in Brazil, previously identified as L. humile, are likely a different species.  The microsatellite-based analysis provided resolution among native & introduced populations of L. humile that could not be resolved using the mitochondrial sequences.  In the native range, colonies that were geographically close to one another tended to be genetically similar, whereas more distant colonies were genetically different.  Most samples from the introduced range were genetically similar, although some exceptions were noted.  Most introduced populations were similar to native populations from the southern Rio Parana & were particularly similar to a population from Rosario, Argentina.  These findings implicate populations from the southern Rio Parana, as the most likely source of introduced populations.

As a consequence, they also affect plant growth & distribution, nutrient cycling, & nutrient availability.  Although some ant species are specialized termite predators, there is probably a high level of opportunistic predation by generalist ant species, & hence their impact on ecosystem processes that termites are known to provide varies at the species level.  The most fruitful future research direction will be to evaluate the impact of ant-termite predation on broader ecosystem processes.  To do this it will be necessary to quantify the efficacy both of particular ant species & of ant communities as a whole in regulating termite populations in different biomes.

    "abstract": "In Hawaii, invasive plants have the ability to alter litter-based food chains because they often have litter traits that differ from native species. Additionally, abundant invasive predators, especially those representing new trophic levels, can reduce prey. The relative importance of these two processes on the litter invertebrate community in Hawaii is important, because they could affect the large number of endemic and endangered invertebrates. We determined the relative importance of litter resources, represented by leaf litter of two trees, an invasive nitrogen-fixer, Falcataria moluccana, and a native tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, and predation of an invasive terrestrial frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, on leaf litter invertebrate abundance and composition. Principle component analysis revealed that F. moluccana litter creates an invertebrate community that greatly differs from that found in M. polymorpha litter. We found that F. moluccana increased the abundance of non-native fragmenters (Amphipoda and Isopoda) by 400% and non-native predaceous ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) by 200%. E. coqui had less effect on the litter invertebrate community; it reduced microbivores by 40% in F. moluccana and non-native ants by 30% across litter types. E. coqui stomach contents were similar in abundance and composition in both litter treatments, despite dramatic differences in the invertebrate community. Additionally, our results suggest that invertebrate community differences between litter types did not cascade to influence E. coqui growth or survivorship. In conclusion, it appears that an invasive nitrogen-fixing tree species has a greater influence on litter invertebrate community abundance and composition than the invasive predator, E. coqui.

Mineral oil traps captured significantly lower numbers of two species of scavenger flies and one morphospecies of plant-feeding fly, and one species of sweet-feeding ant. Because of the fragile nature of endemic Hawaiian insect fauna, the propylene glycol antifreeze bucket trap is best suited for use in environments (e.g., non-native habitats) where endemic species are known to be absent and mineral oil traps are more suited for minimizing insect captures in environmentally sensitive habitats.

The general consensus of entomologists and myrmecologists is that permanent, sustainable control of these ants in the USA will likely depend on self-sustaining biological control agents. A metagenomics approach successfully resulted in discovery of three viruses infecting S. invicta.

In sampled locations where S. invicta and S. geminata are sympatric (specifically, Gainesville, FL and Travis, TX), SINV-1 was detected in S. geminata. Conversely, in areas in which S. geminata and S. invicta are allopatric, SINV-1 was not detected in S. geminata; these locations included north Australia (n = 12), southern Mexico (n = 107), Hawaii (n = 48), Taiwan (n = 12), and the Johnston Atoll (n = 6).

These occurrences suggest that S. invicta is the host of predilection, or preferred host for SINV-1, and that the congenerics, S. geminata and S. richteri serve as either accidental, reservoir, or transfer hosts. The minus genome strand of SINV-1 was detected in S. geminata and S. richteri indicating that these species may serve as functional hosts capable of supporting SINV-1 replication.

Two genotypes examined, SINV-1 and -1A, exhibited similar seasonal prevalence patterns. Infection rates among colonies of S. invicta in Gainesville, Florida, were lowest from early winter (December) to early spring (April) increasing rapidly in late spring (May) and remaining high through August before declining again in the fall (September/October). Correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between mean monthly temperature and SINV-1 (p<0.0005, r=0.82) and SINV-1A (p<0.0001, r=0.86) infection rates in S. invicta colonies. SINV-1 was widely distributed among S. invicta populations. The virus was detected in S. invicta from Argentina and from all U.S. states examined, with the exception of New Mexico. SINV-1 and -1A were also detected in other Solenopsis species. SINV-1 was detected in Solenopsis richteri and the S. invicta/richteri hybrid collected from northern Alabama and Solenopsis geminata from Florida. SINV-1A was detected in S. geminata and Solenopsis carolinensis in Florida and the S. invicta/richteri hybrid in Alabama. Of the 1989 arthropods collected from 6 pitfall trap experiments from Gainesville and Williston, Florida, none except S. invicta tested positive for SINV-1 or SINV-1A. SINV-1 did not appear to infect or replicate within Sf9 or Dm-2 cells in vitro. The number of SINV-1 genome copies did not significantly increase over the course of the experiment, nor were any cytopathic effects observed. Phylogenetic analyses of SINV-1/-1A nucleotide sequences indicated significant divergence between viruses collected from Argentina and the U.S.   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)",

    "abstract": "Despite being one of the most destructive invasive species of ants, only two natural enemies are known currently for Wasmannia auropunctata, commonly known as the electric ant or little fire ant. Because viruses can be effective biological control agents against many insect pests, including ants, a metagenomics/next-generation sequencing approach was used to facilitate discovery of virus sequences from the transcriptomes of W. auropunctata. Five new and complete positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus genomes, and one new negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus genome were identified, sequenced, and characterized from W. auropunctata collected in Argentina by this approach, including a dicistrovirus (Electric ant dicistrovirus), two polycipiviruses (Electric ant polycipivirus 1; Electric ant polycipivirus 2), a solinvivirus (Electric ant solinvivirus), a divergent genome with similarity to an unclassified group in the Picornavirales (Electric ant virus 1), and a rhabdovirus (Electric ant rhabdovirus). An additional virus genome was detected that is likely Solenopsis invicta virus 10 (MH727527). The virus genome sequences were absent from the transcriptomes of W. auropunctata collected in the USA (Hawaii and Florida). Additional limited field surveys corroborated the absence of these viruses in regions where the electric ant is invasive (the USA and Australia). The replicative genome strand of four of the viruses (Electric ant polycipivirus 2, Electric ant solinvivirus, Electric ant virus 1, and Solenopsis invicta virus 10 (in the electric ant) was detected in Argentinean-collected W. auropunctata indicating that the ant is a host for these viruses. These are the first virus discoveries to be made from W. auropunctata.

    "abstract": "Invertebrates constitute the most diverse Pacific island animal lineages and have correspondingly suffered the most devastating extinction rates. Losses of native invertebrate lineages have been driven largely by ecosystem changes brought about by loss of habitat and direct predation by introduced species. Although Hawai'i notably lacks native terrestrial reptiles and amphibians, both intentional and unintentional anthropogenic releases of herpetofauna have resulted in establishment of more than two dozen species of frogs, toads, turtles, lizards, and a snake. Despite well-known presence of nonnative predatory species in Hawai'i, ecological impacts remain unstudied for a majority of these species. In this study, we evaluated diet of the Japanese wrinkled frog, Glandirana rugosa, an intentional biocontrol release in the Hawaiian Islands in the late nineteenth century. We collected live frogs on O'ahu and used museum collections from both O\u0018ahu and Maui to determine exploited diet composition. These data were then compared with a published dietary analysis from the native range in Japan. We compiled and summarized field and museum distribution data from O'ahu, Maui, and Kaua'i to document current range of this species. Gut content analyses suggest that diet composition in the Hawaiian Islands is significantly different from that in its native Japan. In the native range, dominant taxonomic groups by volume were Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (moths, butterflies), and Formicidae (ants). Invasive frogs in Hawai'i exploited mostly Dermaptera (earwigs), Amphipoda (landhoppers), and Hemiptera (true bugs). In Hawai'i this species also exploited endemic insects (~4% total volume, 7 genera) and snails (14 snails in three endemic genera). Our results suggest the need for more indepth assessment of ecological impacts of G. rugosa and other established herpetofauna in Hawai'i to improve our ability to prevent and manage ecological damage and ultimately restore diverse island ecosystems.          *[Ants were consumed at relatively high frequency by frogs in Hawai'i (11% by count).]",

After delimiting the infestation, we treated it on twelve occasions over the course of a year using two types of granular baits for the ground layer and a paste bait containing indoxacarb (0.18% a.i.) on the vegetation. These treatments rapidly reduced the W. auropunctata population with only a single ant recorded after five months treatment and none thereafter. To date, one year after initiation of treatments, no further positive detections have been observed and we tentatively report the eradication of this species from Maui. The key components of the treatment program contributing to its success to date have been the baiting of arboreal nests with a formulation designed for use on vegetation and the strategy of baiting repeatedly even after no ants could be detected with conventional survey methods. The response to the detection of this invasive species on Maui is a successful example of multi-agency collaboration and cooperation necessary for invasive species management. We recommend that future eradication and control attempts for this species include treatment of the arboreal components of infested habitats.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the number of successful establishments of the invasive Argentine ant outside native range and to see whether introduced supercolonies have resulted from single or multiple introductions. We also compared the genetic diversity of native versus introduced supercolonies to assess the size of the propagules (i.e. the number of founding individuals) at the origin of the introduced supercolonies.   Global.   We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers and microsatellite loci to study 39 supercolonies of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile covering both the native (n = 25) and introduced range (n = 14).   Data from three mitochondrial genes and 13 nuclear microsatellites suggest that the introduced supercolonies studied originated from at least seven founding events out of the native area in Argentina (primary introductions). The distribution of mtDNA haplotypes also suggests that supercolonies in the introduced range each derive from a single source supercolony and that one of these source supercolonies has been particularly successful, being the basis of many introduced populations spread across the world. Comparison of the genetic diversity of supercolonies based on the five most diverse loci also revealed that native and introduced supercolonies have greatly overlapping ranges of diversity, although the genetic diversity is on average less in introduced than in native supercolonies.   Both primary introductions (from the native range) and secondary introductions (from sites with established invasive supercolonies) were important in the global expansion of the Argentine ant. In combination with the similar social organization of colonies in the native and introduced range, this indicates that invasiveness did not evolve recently as a unique and historically contingent event (e.g. reduction of genetic diversity) in this species. Rather, native L. humile supercolonies have characteristics that make them pre-adapted to invade new - and in particular disturbed - habitats when given the opportunity. These results have important implications with regard to possible strategies to be used to control invasive ants.",

Because they reach extremely high densities (up to 90,000 frogs/ha), they have the potential to affect invertebrate prey communities. Previously, researchers used frogs collected only at night to characterize their prey. Because Coquis use retreat sites near the forest floor during the day and understory perch sites at night, frogs collected at night might show different amounts and types of prey than would frogs collected in the morning. We analyzed stomach contents of 435 frogs collected in the morning (0300-0600 h) and at night (1900-2200 h) from five sites on the island of Hawaii. Frogs collected in the morning had 1.7 times more prey items and 2.1 times greater prey volume than those collected at night; however, prey composition did not differ between morning- and evening-collected frogs. Across sites, Formicidae (ants) and Amphipoda (amphipods) were the dominant prey, and at least 61.6% of their prey items were nonnative species. Across sites, morning- and evening-collected stomach contents were not different from environmental samples of leaf-litter invertebrates but were different from environmental samples of foliage and flying invertebrates, suggesting that Coquis forage primarily in the leaf litter throughout the night. Previous research that investigated stomach contents of frogs collected only at night greatly underestimated the number and volume of prey items that Coquis consume during the entire foraging period but accurately described their primary prey: nonnative, leaf-litter invertebrates.          *[Ants only identified to family.]",

    "abstract": "Mutualism can facilitate the colonization, establishment, and spread of invasive species. By modifying interactions with third parties, mutualisms can have cascading community-wide effects. Both native and invasive ants are capable of forming mutualisms with hemipteran insects, preying on non-hemipteran herbivores and indirectly affecting primary production. Comparative research on the effects of both native and invasive ant exclusions on multitrophic interactions is therefore crucial for understanding the invasive potential of ants, along with any ecological consequences that invasions may have. We performed a quantitative review of the multitrophic effects of invasive and native ants on insect\u0013plant food webs. Herbivorous insects are the most common food source for both invasive (comprising 56% of prey species caught) and native ants (55% of the prey species caught), followed by predators (31% for invasive ants, 45% for native ants). Excluding both invasive and native ants significantly reduced hemipteran abundance, and excluding invasive ants had a greater negative impact on hemipteran abundance than native ants. Native ant predation significantly reduced herbivore abundance, but excluding invasive ants had no effect. Cascading effects of native ants on plant fitness were significantly positive, but there was no significant impact of invasive ants. These findings suggest a weak relationship between the presence of invasive ants and non-hemipteran herbivore abundance.

There has been subsequent radiation in several genera, particularly Camponotus, Cerapachys, Leptogenys, Lordomyrma, Pheidole, and Strumigenys, with one endemic genus, Poecilomyrma.  The native fauna predominates in intact forest.  Exotic species are most common in disturbed ecosystems, including towns, villages, and agricultural areas.

Cardiocondyla minutior appears to be originally from the Indo-Malayan region, where all its closest relatives are found. Surprisingly, there are few records of C. minutior from this region. Instead, most Old World records of C. minutior come from Pacific and Indian Ocean islands where there are few or no native ants, e.g., the Chagos Archipelago, Hawaii, \u0152les \u2026parses, Easter Island, the Marquesas Islands, the Seychelles, and the Society Islands. Cardiocondyla minutior is becoming widespread in tropical and subtropical parts of the New World. The success of Cardiocondyla species in exotic locales may be due, in part, to their ability to co-exist with dominant invasive ants, such as the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomyrmex gracilis is a large, slender arboreal ant with a painful sting. This species has a broad native range spanning much of the New World tropics and subtropics. In addition, P. gracilis has established exotic populations, notably in Florida and Hawaii. Here, I compiled and mapped records of P. gracilis from >1500 sites in 32 geographic areas (countries and US states) to evaluate its worldwide distribution and update information on its recent spread. Pseudomyrmex gracilis has an essentially continuous distribution ranging from southern Uruguay (approximately 34.9\u221eS) and central Argentina (approximately 34.5\u221eS), through much of South and Central America, to southern Texas (approximately 31.3\u221eN), with recent records (all since 1995) in southern Louisiana (29.9-31.3\u221eN). Populations of P. gracilis were first discovered in southeast Florida in 1960. Since then, P. gracilis populations have expanded northward in Florida, up to approximately 30.8\u221eN. In 2009, a P. gracilis population was discovered in Mississippi (approximately 30.6\u221eN). Genetic analyses are needed to determine whether the recent appearance of P. gracilis in Louisiana and Mississippi has resulted from this species expanding its range eastward out of Texas or westward out of Florida. Exotic populations of P. gracilis in Hawaii were first found on Oahu in 1976. There are now >20 reports of P. gracilis from Oahu, Kaho'olawe, and Maui, suggesting that the Hawaiian populations are expanding. Finally, there are a few exotic records of P. gracilis from the West Indies: Barbados, Guadeloupe, and Jamaica. It remains to seen whether or not the wide-ranging P. gracilis, which has become so well established across Florida, will show comparable success in Hawaii and other regions it has invaded.",

Invasive ant species with powerful stings, such as Solenopsis invicta Buren, 1974, have received much media attention.

Ants were surveyed at 10 long-term sampling sites. Ants were common on Mauna Kea up to 2000 m elevation, but densities quickly dropped off above that. Five species of ants were collected: Linepithema humile (Mayr), Cardiocondyla venustula Wheeler, Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius), Tetramorium bicarinatum (Nylander), and Monomorium pharaonis (Linnaeus). Other than L. humile, these collections on Mauna Kea are the highest recorded locales in the Hawaiian Islands.          *[P. megacephala is the dominant ant below 1000-m elevation in Hawaii, whereas L. humile is largely absent from the Hawaiian lowlands; instead dominates areas above 1000-m elevation.  At high elevations on the Big Island of Hawaii, L. humile dominates on the semiarid western slope of Mauna Kea, but does not penetrate less-disturbed parts of the more humid Kilauea Caldera region.]   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)",

    "abstract": "The little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, has been increasing in importance as an exotic pest. Here we review published and unpublished information on its distribution, ecology, impact, and control. Wasmannia auropunctata occurs throughout most of the warmer parts of the New World, from subtropical Argentina to subtropical Mexico and through much of the Caribbean, though it is not clear whether this species in native to this entire region. During the past century, exotic populations of W. auropunctata have become established in numerous other places, including the Galapagos Islands, West Africa (Gabon, Cameroon, and possibly the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo), Melanesia (New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and possibly Tuvalu), Polynesia (Wallis and Futuna and Hawaii), the mainland US (Florida and possibly California), and on subtropical Atlantic islands (the Bahamas and Bermuda). The latitudinal range of known outdoors populations of W. auropunctata is from 32o40'S in Argentina to 32o20'N in Bermuda. Wasmannia auropunctata is also a greenhouse pest in more temperate regions, such as England and Canada. In many areas, W. auropunctata can be a significant agricultural pest, not only stinging agricultural workers, but also enhancing populations of Homoptera. Homoptera cause damage both through sapping plants of nutrients and by increasing the occurrence of diseases, including viral and fungal infections. In addition, W. auropunctata has negative impacts on many animals, both invertebrates and vertebrates, though most reports on such impact have been anecdotal. The impacts of W. auropunctata populations seem to be most severe on tropical islands where it is not native, such as the Galapagos, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. Reports of widespread blindness in both domestic and native mammals caused by W. auropunctata stings deserve serious attention. Chemical control of W. auropunctata may be possible for small exotic populations spread over a few dozen hectares or less. For large exotic infestations, the only hope for long-term control appears to be classical biocontrol.          *[Wasmannia williamsoni misspelled Wasmannia williamsi.]",

The extent of its original native range is unclear. Here, we examined the worldwide distribution of S. sechellensis, particularly its spread to the New World. We compiled published and unpublished S. sechellensis specimen records from >160 sites. We documented the earliest known S. sechellensis records for 43 geographic areas (countries, island groups, and West Indian islands), including many islands for which we found no previously published records, in Southeast Asia (Singapore), the Indian Ocean (Comoro Islands, \u0152les \u2026parses, Mascarene Islands), Pacific Ocean (Palau), Atlantic Ocean (Cape Verde Islands), and the Caribbean (Guadeloupe, Grenada, Martinique, Mona, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, St. Lucia, St. Martin, St. Thomas, St. Vincent, and Trinidad). The geographic ranges of S. sechellensis and other Syllophopsis species suggest that S. sechellensis may be native to Madagascar and neighboring islands in the western Indian Ocean or to Southeast Asia or both. The earliest known record of S. sechellensis in the New World was collected in Barbados in 2003. We recorded this species on 11 additional West Indian islands. This finding might indicate that S. sechellensis is rapidly spreading through the West Indies. Alternatively, it may be that this inconspicuous ant has simply been overlooked or misidentified in this region.          *[Records also given for Syllophopsis subcoeca from Singapore & the West Indies: Barbados, Guadeloupe, Grenada, St. Croix, St. Lucia.]",

To evaluate its worldwide distribution & potential for further spread, we mapped records of L. humile from more than 2100 sites.  Because several South & Central American Linepithema species have been often mis-identified as L. humile, we excluded all unconfirmed South & Central American records.  We documented the earliest known L. humile records for 95 geographic areas (countries, island groups, major islands, & US states), including several for which we found no previously published records.  We could not confirm any L. humile records from several South & Central American countries with published reports.Most records of L. humile come from the subtropics, particularly from regions with Mediterranean-like climates (i.e., warm dry summers and cool moist winters), including its native range in South America & exotic populations in California, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, & Japan.  In more humid subtropical areas, such as the southeast US, L. humile rarely dominates outside urban areas.  In tropical latitudes, L. humile dominates only at higher elevations, most notably in Hawaii.  In temperate areas, L. humile is almost exclusively an indoor pest.  Linepithema humile has already spread to most subtropical lowland regions with Mediterranean-like climates, but is not known yet from most tropical highland areas with suitable climates.  In the past, L. humile probably arrived in tropical regions by sea accompanying human commerce & had to survive coastal lowland conditions before spreading to higher, cooler elevations.  Nowadays air travel allows L. humile to stowaway in cargo delivered almost anywhere in the world.  Therefore, a wider spread of this pest is expected in the future.]",

    "abstract": "*[Benefits derived from adventive insects can be extended to the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta).  It not only can be a useful predator under certain conditions & provided insights into the evolution of social organization in insects, but also helped shape the career of Edward O. Wilson, indirectly promoting studies in insect biodiversity.  Wilson's discovery of the ant at Mobile, Alabama, when he was only 13, represented the earliest U.S. record of the species & his first scientific observation.  At 19, he took a leave of absence from the University of Alabama to study the fire ant's spread & impact.  This work for the state conservation department was the first professional position for a biologist who would popularize biodiversity studies & become a leading scientist of the 20th century.  The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) might facilitate the success of an immigrant mealybug (Antonina graminis) that uses the ant's honeydew.  Medical effects from invasive insects include  life-threatening envenomation & hypersensitive reactions from adventive hymenopterans such as red imported fire ant, & other ant species.  Hybridization & introgression, though apparently uncommon in insects, occur in between the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) & an immigrant congener (S. richteri) in a portion of their U.S. range.  Ants are among the more spectacular of invasive organisms; several hundred species have been or are being moved in global trade.  Those moving readily in commerce (the so-called tramp species) afford opportunities for behavioral, ecological, & evolutionary studies relevant to conservation & agriculture.  Immigrant ants not only can reduce biodiversity, but also can disrupt the biological control of plant pests & disassemble native ant communities.  Immigrant ants, in turn, sometimes are replaced by later-arriving ant species.  The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) adversely affects various invertebrate & vertebrate groups. There are recent review of the causes & consequences of ant invasions, of the effects of the red imported fire ant on biodiversity, & critiques of purported ecological effects from this fire ant.  In the Cape fynbos flora (South Africa), the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) has displaced native ants associated with certain precinctive proteaceous plants whose seeds are ant dispersed (myrmecochores).   Detected in the Seychelles islands in the 1960s, Anoplolepis gracilipes also has begun to affect biodiversity on Bird Island in the Seychelles, following its discovery in the 1980s.

    "abstract": "Invasive species have devastating economic and ecological impacts worldwide, but proactive monitoring programs are rare on the global stage. By definition, tramp ants are associated with disturbance and human-mediated dispersal, making them especially concerning invasive threats. A proactive\u0014rather than reactive\u0014approach to monitoring for, preventing, and managing invasive species depends on taxonomic preparedness, which enables rapid and accurate identification. Emerging tools and technologies, including genomic barcoding and interactive online keys, can aid in species delimitation and diagnosis. However, resolving tramp species' identities remains the fundamental first step in invasive species management because diagnostic tools cannot be developed and disseminated until species names are stable. Diagnosis of morphologically difficult species requires basic knowledge of species boundaries, biogeography, and phylogenetic relationships. This review comprehensively synthesizes information available for 15 known and five potential tramp ant species in Nylanderia (Emery) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae): a globally distributed genus of over 130 described species, many of which are only diagnosable by subtle morphological characters. Nylanderia records were drawn from published literature, specimen databases, and museum collections to compile known distributions, biology, natural history, and taxonomy for each species. We review existing resources for visualizing known geographic ranges and high-resolution images of ants globally and encourage the use of these types of tools in support of invasive species diagnosis and distribution tracking. Finally, we discuss how taxonomic and life history information can be used synergistically with genomic and digital technology to develop tools for identification of these, and other emerging invasive insect species.",

    "abstract": "Body size is an important life history trait that can evolve rapidly as a result of how species interact with each other and their environment. Invasive species often encounter vastly different ecological conditions throughout their introduced range that can influence relative investment in growth, reproduction and defence among populations. In this study, we quantified variation in worker size, morphology and proportion of majors among five populations of a worldwide invasive species, the big-headed ant, Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius). The sampled populations differed in ant community composition, allowing us to examine if P.\tmegacephala invests differently in the size and number of majors based on the local ant fauna. We also used genetic data to determine if these populations of P.\tmegacephala represented cryptic species or if morphological differences could be attributed to change following introduction. We found significant variation in worker mass among the populations. Both major and minor workers were largest in Australia, where the ant fauna was most diverse, and minor workers were smallest in Hawaii and Mauritius, where P.\tmegacephala interacted with few to no other ants. We also found differences in major and minor worker morphology among populations. Majors from Mauritius had significantly larger heads (width and length) relative to whole body size than those from Hawaii and Florida. Minors had longer heads and hind tibias in South Africa compared with populations from Australia, Hawaii and Florida. The proportion of majors did not differ among populations, suggesting that these populations may not be subject to trade-offs in investment in major size versus number. Our molecular data place all samples within the same clade, supporting that these morphologically different populations represent the same species. These results suggest that the variation in shape and morphology of major and minor workers may therefore be the result of rapid adaptation or plastic responses to local conditions.

    "abstract": "An unresolved question in ecology concerns why the ecological effects of invasions vary in magnitude. Many introduced species fail to interact strongly with the recipient biota, whereas others profoundly disrupt the ecosystems they invade through predation, competition, and other mechanisms. In the context of ecological impacts, research on biological invasions seldom considers phenotypic or microevolutionary changes that occur following introduction. Here, we show how plasticity in key life history traits (colony size and longevity), together with omnivory, magnifies the predatory impacts of an invasive social wasp (Vespula pensylvanica) on a largely endemic arthropod fauna in Hawaii. Using a combination of molecular, experimental, and behavioral approaches, we demonstrate (i) that yellowjackets consume an astonishing diversity of arthropod resources and depress prey populations in invaded Hawaiian ecosystems and (ii) that their impact as predators in this region increases when they shift from small annual colonies to large perennial colonies. Such trait plasticity may influence invasion success and the degree of disruption that invaded ecosystems experience. Moreover, postintroduction phenotypic changes may help invaders to compensate for reductions in adaptive potential resulting from founder events and small population sizes. The dynamic nature of biological invasions necessitates a more quantitative understanding of how postintroduction changes in invader traits affect invasion processes.          *[Paratrechina listed as prey.]",

    "abstract": "Predation by the Argentine ant, Iridomyrmex humilis (Mayr), on mature larvae and teneral adult fliesof the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), was studied in the laboratory and on the ground beneath fruit trees in Hawaii. In the laboratory, 50% mortality was reached after a 10-min attack by an average of seven ants per larva. Of the 50 teneral adult flies placed in the ant colony, all were killed by ants. In a field test in Kula, Maui, Hawaii, where mature larvae were dropped onto the ground, larval mortality caused by I. humilis was significantly higher on the south side (3.9%) than on the north side (2.3%) of the trees. when C. capitata pupae were buried in the soil beneath fruit trees, the average mortality of 2,300 teneral adult flies was 38.8%. We infer that most of this mortality was caused by foraging ants.

    "abstract": "The little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), is an invasive ant with negative impacts on both biodiversity and agriculture throughout the tropics and subtropics. Field experiments were conducted in order to elucidate the relative attractiveness of the enantiomers of the alarm pheromones, 2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and 3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine. The enantiomers tested were synthesized from commercially available (S)-2-methylbutan-1-ol or kinetically resolved (R)-2-methylbutan-1-ol, prepared using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (PCL). Bioassays conducted in a macadamia orchard on the island of Hawaii demonstrated that W. auropunctata were preferentially attracted to the (S)-enantiomers of both alkyl pyrazines over the racemic mixtures in all experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of differential attraction of ants to the enantiomers of chiral pyrazine pheromones despite many examples of these compounds in the literature. In addition, using a chiral column it was determined that (S)-2,5-dimethyl-3-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine and (S)-3-methyl-2-(2-methylbutyl)pyrazine are the only enantiomers produced by W. auropunctata.
