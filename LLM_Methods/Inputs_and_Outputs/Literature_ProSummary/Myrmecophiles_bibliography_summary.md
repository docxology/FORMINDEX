    "abstract": "Maintaining and updating FORMIS requires the cooperative efforts of myrmecologists throughout the world.  >>Please begin by inspecting citations of your own work for accuracy and completeness<<.  The addition of keywords and/or abstracts would be especially useful.  Please see the next section for instructions about how to contribute or update citations.  AGRICOLA will be searched to keep FORMIS updated; however, this will only find a small portion of the literature.  It is hoped that this database will become a magnet and distribution mechanism for specialty ant bibliographies like the Fire Ant Literature Database.  Specialty bibliographies are needed for genera such as Formica, Camponotus, Myrmica, Pheidole, Monomorium, Messor and Cataglyphis to name a few.  Specialty bibliographies on subjects such as foraging, bioenergetics, myrmecophiles, and ant-plant symbioses would also be useful.  Geographic bibliographies for places like Hawaii, India, Mexico, Brazil, etc. could also be assembled.  Specialty bibliographies can range from a few dozen citations to several thousand; the only requirement is that they be thorough.  New citations could also be added by journal.  Please contact Dr. Porter if you are interested in adding a bibliography to FORMIS.  Users are welcome to create their own customized bibliographies from FORMIS; however, they should be aware that personal modifications to FORMIS will be lost in future updates if they are not sent in for official inclusion.  Also, users who use EndNote to automatically create bibliographies at the end of their papers should be aware that citation numbers in FORMIS will not be consistant from year to year, so a paper started on one database needs to be finished on the same one.",

Host worker ants never attacked these beetles, and often gave regurgitant to Z. comes following tactile communication with the beetle. By contrast, the workers from colonies without the myrmecophiles showed hostile responses towards Z. comes before tactile contact, but were not aware of D. fossulatus until contact. In L. fuliginosus, workers within a colony shared profiles, but the profiles differed among colonies. GC analyses showed that both Z. comes and D. fossulatus beetles had the same hydrocarbons as L. fuliginosus, and the profiles were more similar to those of the host colony workers than the foreign workers. Both Z. comes and D. fossulatus appear to imitate the hydrocarbon profile of their host workers, allowing integrating into the host nest. A Y-maze bioassay indicated that Z. comes can follow the trail pheromone of L. fuliginosus. This suggests that Z. comes may detect other chemical signals of L. fuliginosus to keep closer interactions with the workers.",

    "abstract": "*[Chemical tactics by ant social parasites, including myrmecophiles, often relate to ant nestmate recognition & alarm communication.  The strict nestmate recognition system in ants can be disrupted by chemical imitation of the nestmate recognition pheromone, which consists of cuticular hydrocarbon components.  Social parasites often acquire these components through direct body contact, but occasionally synthesize them even before ant adoption.  Such an imitation of the host cuticular chemicals causes species-specific adoption of the parasites, which are then often taken care of by ants for long terms.  In contrast, transient invaders often use a propaganda allomone that induces panic alarm responses in ants.  The allomone occasionally even causes fighting among nestmate ants, & seems to disrupt the ant nestmate recognition.  These 2 chemical strategies are to modify the ant responses after ant detection.  A third chemical strategy taken by some insect species is to avoid the detection itself, & is evidenced in the chemical phytomimesis by geometriid twig-like caterpillars.  Since this counts upon the ants not to respond to the \"invasion\", it usually does not cause visible responses when it works effectively.  Appropriate evaluation methods are necessary to evaluate the ant responses induced by the parasites to reveal the underlying mimetic strategy.]",

Ant species identity was an important factor determining the densities of myrmecophiles & non-myrmecophiles on the host plant, in addition to affecting the responses of herbivores to increases in host plant quality.  Aphids were more abundant in the presence of the exotic Linepithema humile versus the native Camponotus floridanus.

A summer-long survey indicated that areas with large populations of F. exsectoides had larger populations of the aphid Cinara banksiana Pepper & Tissot and the soft scale Toumeyella parvicornis (Cockerell), two obligate myrmecophiles, than areas with low or no F. exsectoides populations. Cinara ontarioensis Bradley was also obligately tended by ants but did not show a significant response to F. exsectoides densities, having a patchy distribution. In contrast, in areas without F. exsectoides, these homopterans were replaced by the woolly aphid Schizolachnus piniradiatae (Davidson), a species that never forms ant associations. Mound ant exclusion experiments and observations indicated that F. exsectoides preyed upon S. piniradiatae, potentially reducing their numbers in areas with this ant. Aphid and scale predators showed a mixed response to F. exsectoides presence: densities of lacewing larvae and salticid spiders were inversely related to F. exsectoides populations, whereas mirid populations did not show a response to different F. exsectoides densities. This study suggests that the presence of large populations of aggressive, honeydew seeking F. exsectoides can shift the homopteran community from one composed predominantly of nonmyrmecophilous species to one composed of myrmecophilous species.",

    "abstract": "The genus Attaphila , comprising minute myrmecophilous cockroaches, is revised, including now six previously known (A. aptera , A. bergi , A. flava , A. fungicola , A. schuppi , A. sexdentis) and three new species (A. multisetosa sp. nov. Bohn and Klass, A. paucisetosa sp. nov. Bohn and Klass, A. sinuosocarinata sp. nov. Bohn and Klass). All species are described or redescribed and depicted with their main characteristics; determination keys allow the identification of males and females. Especially the male characters allow a distribution to two species-groups with differing host specificity: bergi-group associated with Acromyrmex (and possibly Amoimyrmex) ants, fungicola-group associated with Atta ants; the former appears paraphyletic, the latter monophyletic. The genus Attaphila is characterised emphasising its unique features: (1) insertion of antennae at the bottom of a wide funnel-shaped deepening; (2) antenna with the possibility of a rectangular bending between scapus and pedicellus (associated with a distal excavation of the scapus) and (3) with an unusual shape and low number of antennomeres; (4) femora of legs with a ventral groove allowing a close spacing of femur and tibia during a strong flexion; (5) a complex and unusual shape of the laterosternal shelf area of the female genitalia (lack of shelf, presence of a pair of complicated tubular invaginations); and (6) lateral parts of abdominal tergite T9 of male ending in a pair of ventromesally directed arms, which contact the lateral margins of the subgenital plate. Functional aspects and the possible biological roles of these features are discussed. Older biological data are summarised and new observations are presented. The position of Attaphila within Blattodea is discussed. Like a recent molecular study, the morphology of the male genitalia places the genus in the Blaberoidea. The molecular result of Attaphila being closest to three particular blattellid genera, however, is conflictual from the morphological perspective.",

Nurse workers hold the larvae in their mandibles while resting along the nest's walls.  When nests are visited or inhabited by myrmecophiles and/or predators, especially Histeridae beetles (adults & larvae), ant workers hide their brood in the nest's subsidiary chamber.   The entrance of which is then blocked by the peculiar phragmotic disk of the single ergatoid queen in the colony.  The extremely modified head & anterior slope of the pronotum of the queen (jointly form the almost circular frontal disk) represent a new kind of cryptic phragmosis in ants.   The exceptional modifications of these structures, which are covered with intricate sculpture, enables the queen to behave as a living gate to the brood chamber, yielding entering nestmates when tapped by them on the disk.  Workers use fine grained debris to build a wall at the beginning of the brood's chamber, such that the entrance opening matches the diameter of the queen's frontal disk.  Observations in several different Brazilian localities revealed that the queens' frontal disk bear unique locality-specific sculpturing patterns, possibly due to viscous population structures caused by the limited dispersal by virgin queens, whose wing buds never develop.  Other ants listed were identified from carcasses found inside the nest.  Histerid beetle adults & larvae observed preying on ant larvae.]",

We compared volumes of infected colonies with those of healthy colonies within an area where infected colonies were common and with those of healthy colonies from an area free of the infection. We also compared presence of polygyny, numbers of queens, presence and abundance of sexuals, broods, and myrmecophiles. Mound volume of infected colonies was substantially smaller than that of healthy colonies from the same area and from the disease-free area (4.9 versus 14.7 and 18.7 liters, respectively). Polygyny, number of queens per colony, presence of worker broods, and presence of winged females and males did not differ significantly in infected and healthy colonies. Sexual broods were less frequent in infected than in healthy colonies (17 versus 37%, respectively). Presence of myrmecophiles was as frequent in infected as in healthy colonies, but the bug Blissus parasigaster (Bergroth) was more numerous in infected colonies. T. solenopsae may be a good candidate for the biological control of imported fire ants in the United States.

    "abstract": "*[In Chapter 1, I examined ant richness, species frequencies, & community composition in 23 warm season constructed grasslands that varied in both patch & landscape level characteristics.  Ant species richness was greater in older sites with sandier soils, while community composition was structured by soil texture, management, & urban land use.  Frequency analyses for 14 ant species showed a wide range of responses to both patch & landscape components of the environment including age, management, soil texture, & surrounding land use.  My findings support the use of ants as environmental indicators of disturbance in agricultural landscapes and show that diversity in constructed grasslands is structured by both patch and landscape level processes.  In Chapter 2, I determined the relative importance of host & habitat for an ant-dependent commensalism (phoretic mites).  I found that large, cosmopolitan, & abundant ant species support a greater proportion of the mite diversity.  Additionally, I found that patch level characteristics, or environmental context (area, age, soil texture, litter depth), of the host can alter the associated mite diversity.  In Chapter 3, predictions of theory, herbivore resource hypotheses, & spatial parasitology were used to identify the extent of the ecological neighborhood for mites associated with ants.  My results indicate that commensal mite communities are consistent with the Resource Size Hypothesis & are sensitive to ecological neighborhoods at multiple hierarchical levels including individual host ants, the host ant colony, surrounding nest community, & habitat type, but do not vary significantly among sites.  In chapter 4, I examined the importance of spatial arrangement of ant nests for mite dispersal among nests in a homogenous environment & the role of seasonal synchrony with hosts.  I found significant spatial autocorrelation for mite communities at the closest distance class & evidence of increased mite abundance & richness during periods of ant colony reproduction. Together, these studies demonstrate that processes at multiple temporal and spatial scales contribute to biodiversity and community assembly within conservation habitats and that the context of ant hosts can modify their roles as biodiversity regulators.]",

We hypothesized that mite diversity is determined by availability of suitable host ant species, soil detrital resources & texture, & habitat disturbance.  Results showed that that large-bodied & widely distributed ant species within grasslands support the most diverse mite assemblages.  Mite richness & abundance were predicted by overall ant richness & grassland area, but host traits & environmental predictors varied among ant hosts: mites associated with Aphaenogaster rudis depended on litter depth, while Myrmica americana associates were predicted by host frequency and grassland age.

Mites are the most abundant guests in ant nests and are frequently observed in phoretic relationships with ants. Little is known about the effects of ecological and life history characteristics of ant hosts on mite species richness. Previous work focused on mite descriptions and provided little ecological information. Phoretic mites were surveyed for 43 ant species in 273 colonies in Ohio. Mite collections totaled 151 species including representatives of the cohorts Astigmatina and Heterostigmatina, and the suborder Mesostigmata. Most mite species had specific host species and attachment sites on the ants. Statistical analyses showed mite species richness to be highest in colonies of ant species that are (1) populous, (2) large bodied, (3) in the genus Lasius, and (4) established through social parasitism. The species richness was higher for ant species with social parasitism or the genus Lasius, but the relative importance of other host ecological and life history variables differed among mite taxa. Prevalence was greater for female ant alates than workers or males and was positively influenced by (1) host size, (2) social parasitism, and (3) the genus Lasius. These results suggest that greater ant diversity also supports a greater diversity of associated mites, but that mite diversity is disproportionately higher in ant species with greater resource availability within nests or those that may facilitate the exchange of mite assemblages among ant nests.",

    "abstract": "The intranidal myrmecophilous arthropod fauna of the Maltese Islands is reviewed. Thirty species from nine orders are found to be obligate myrmecophiles, of which four species are recorded from the Maltese archipelago for the first time: Phrurolithus sp. (Araneae: Phrurolithidae), Pogonolaelaps canestrinii (Berlese, 1904), Gymnolaelaps messor Joharchi, Halliday, Saboori & Kamali, 2011 and G. myrmecophilus (Berlese, 1892) (Mesostigmata: Laelapidae). Phrurolithus also represents the first record of the family Phrurolithidae in Malta. Notes on the biology and local distribution of each species are provided, including ant-myrmecophile associations, of which two appear to be previously unknown: the occurrence of Smynthurodes betae Westwood, 1849 (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in the nest of Plagiolepis pygmaea (Latreille, 1798) and Phrurolithus in the nest of Pheidole pallidula (Nylander, 1849). Fourteen additional species are found to be either only occasionally myrmecophilic, accidental ant-guests or potentially myrmecophilous, the latter remaining ambiguous due to a lack of knowledge of their biology. Of these, the family Caeculidae (Arachnida: Trombidiformes) represents a new record for the Maltese Islands, on the basis of Microcaeculus sp. occurring in a nest of Camponotus barbaricus Emery, 1905.

We developed nine microsatellite loci from P. concava. Mean per locus allele number was 6.78, and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.03 to 0.850. One locus exhibited significant heterozygote deficit, possibly due to the presence of null alleles.

    "abstract": "*[This paper provides a summary of the extensive theoretical & empirical work that has been carried out in recent years testing the adaptational significance of various spider-ant associations.  Hundreds of species of spiders have evolved close relationships with ants & can be classified as myrmecomorphs, myrmecophiles, or myrmecophages.  Myrmecomorphs are Batesian mimics.  Their close morphological & behavioral resemblance to ants confers strong survival advantages against visually hunting predators.  Some species of spiders have become integrated into the ant society as myrmecophiles or symbionts.  These spider myrmecophiles gain protection against their own predators, live in an environment with a stable climate, & are typically surrounded by abundant food resources.  The adaptations by which this integration is made possible are poorly known, although it is hypothesized that most spider myrmecophiles are chemical mimics & some are even phoretic on their hosts.  The 3rd type of spider-ant association discussed is myrmecophagy or predatory specialization on ants.  A table of known spider myrmecophages is provided as is information on their biology & hunting strategies.  Myrmecophagy provides these predators with an essentially unlimited food supply & may even confer other protections to the spiders.]          *[Monomorium semirufus (nomen dubium, but probably Messor semirufus (Andr\u00c8).]",

    "abstract": "A comparative chemical analysis of the larval nectar secretions and hemolymph from three unspecifically and facultatively ant-attended lycaenid species (Polyommatus coridon, P. icarus, and Zizeeria knysna) was performed by using high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. Sucrose was the main sugar component in all three species. In half of the samples of P. coridon, it was accompanied by glucose, whereas other sugars occurred only rarely. In P. icarus and Z. knysna, melezitose was the second-most important component, followed by fructose and glucose. Total sugar contents were 43.6 +/- 14.8 g/l (mean +/- SD) for P. coridon, 74.2 g/l for P. icarus, and 68.3 +/- 22.6 g/l for Z. knysna. Up to 14 different identified amino acids were found in P. coridon nectar, with a total content of 9.7 +/- 3.4 g/l. Leucine was always the major component (contributing 50% of overall amino acid content). Other important amino acids were tyrosine, proline, arginine, and phenylalanine. P. icarus nectar contained up to six amino acids with a total content of 1.2 g/l, dominated by tyrosine and phenylalanine. Z. knysna nectar contained alanine and proline, with only 0.3 +/- 0.17 g/l total content. In the hemolymph of all species, up to 16 different amino acids occurred relatively regularly, with histidine dominating, followed by serine and proline. The amino acid pattern in hemolymph was considerably different from that of the nectar secretions. Larval diet weakly influenced P. coridon nectar sugars, and with a semisynthetic diet, a more homogeneous amino acid pattern was detected. Comparison with reports from other lycaenid species shows that secretions rich in amino acids are related to intimate, often obligate ant associations, whereas facultative, unspecific myrmecophiles rely on carbohydrates.",

Here we report the first record of both myrmecophiles in nests of the invasive garden ant Lasius neglectus in the Citadelpark of Ghent, Belgium.   Platyarthrus hoffmannseggii was found in 2 of the Lasius neglectus nests studied.  In one of the 2 nests, C. albinus was also discovered.  In the localities where the invasive garden ant Lasius neglectus was introduced, as is also the case in the Citadelpark in Ghent, it out-competes all native ant species.  This ant has a dramatic effect on the local native ant fauna.  However, some of the myrmecophilous species associated with the native ant-fauna are less threatened as they are accepted by this invasive garden ant.]",

It has been recently postulated that stridulatory organs in Paussus might be evolved as an acoustic mechanism to interact with ants.  Here, we survey the role of acoustic signals employed in the Paussus beetle-Pheidole ant system.  Ants parasitized by Paussus beetles produce caste-specific stridulations.  We found that Paussus can 'speak' 3 different 'languages', each similar to sounds produced by different ant castes (workers, soldiers, queen).  Playback experiments were used to test how host ants respond to the sounds emitted by Paussus.  Our data suggest that, by mimicking the stridulations of the queen, Paussus is able to dupe the workers of its host & to be treated as royalty.  This is the first report of acoustic mimicry in a beetle parasite of ants.]",

Lycaenids are recorded with 5 ant subfamilies, including the first record of an association with the Pseudomyrmecinae.

All ant species that tend lycaenids spend at least some portion of their time foraging on vegetation to collect plant & insect nectar.  There is a robust relationship between the competitive status of ants within a community, & their frequency and degree of association with lycaenids.  Obligate ant-association is accompanied by a high degree of specificity for ant partner, but 2 notable exceptions, Ogyris aenone & O. amaryllis are discussed.

    "abstract": "In ant-aphid interactions, various aphid species offer honeydew to the ant partner and increase their density by ant attendance, whilst others never attend ant species, in which case ants tend to treat them as prey. In this regard, ants should have the ability to distinguish myrmecophile aphid species from non-mutualistic species, so that mutualistic aphids will be accepted as partners rather than prey. Although ant-aphid interactions are now the focus of chemical ecology studies, the role of the different chemical stimuli in determining mutualistic interactions has not been completely clarified. Therefore, we have investigated the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of four myrmecophiles aphid species using GC-MS. We also investigated the behavior of the worker-ants (Lasius niger L., Hymenoptera: Formicidae) to different chemical stimuli derived from aphids. We applied four treatments and found that the behavior of the ant workers varied depending on the source of the different treatments. In particular, the real aphid Aphis pomi and the sugar solution proved to be the most attractive to the ants, while the presence of pure extract of the individuals is enough to disturb the behavior of the ants. We provide evidence that the key stimuli of the tending behavior could be the CHC patterns of the aphids and the CHC profile of the aphids tends to be genus specific. This research will promote further investigations to test the behavior of ant workers towards other species of aphids and treatment combinations.",

The cuticular hydrocarbon profile of the myrmecophilous salticid spider Cosmophasis bitaeniata closely resembles that of its host ant Oecophylla smaragdina. Here, we show that the chemical resemblance of the spider does not arise through physical contact with the adult ants, but instead the spider acquires the cuticular hydrocarbons by eating the ant larvae. More significantly, we show that the variation in the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of the spider depends upon the colony of origin of the ant larvae prey, rather than the parentage of the spider.",

We compared the oribatid assemblages within and outside red wood ant Formica polyctena nests in a Finnish oak forest. Altogether ten mounds were investigated and comparable samples were collected from adjacent soil 4 m from each mound. A total of 10 529 specimens were recovered, 4959 of them in mounds and 5633 in soil. The specimens represented 74 species (and two higher taxa) belonging to 60 genera and 39 families. Significant differences in abundance or diversity were not observed between nests and soil habitats. For nest samples the abundance of specimens significantly correlated with diversity indicating that mounds form rich habitat patches with a diverse set of niches. Mound size had no effect on community composition. The nest and soil habitats were predominantly occupied by different species resulting in dissimilarities in community composition; 34% of the species showed a preference for nest habitat and 50% for soil habitats, whereas16% were indifferent with equal abundances in both habitats. Nonetheless, most of the species with a preference for nests are frequently found in various habitats in nature, and may be classified as facultative myrmecophiles that maintain populations also in ant nests. Ant nests host abundant and diverse oribatid assemblages, which differ from the fauna in adjacent soil, and wood ants are therefore important factors in maintaining biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "*[Life-history data on 1050 phytophagous species of the butterfly subfamily Lycaeninae were used to examine previously suggested correlations between host-plant use & myrmecophily.  Myrmecophily is an ancestral character of the Lycaeninae, which has been reduced independently in a number of lineages (secondary myrmecoxenes).  Members of the order Fabales ('legumes\") are the most widespread, & probably the ancestral, hostplants of Lycaeninae caterpillars.  At subfamily level, myrmecophily is more common among legume feeders than in species utilizing non-legume hosts.  A different pattern emerges on tribal level; Theclini show much a lower affinity to Fabales as hostplants, whereas Polyommatini have a high incidence of myrmecophily even if not feeding on legumes.  A number of non-legume host-plant families support a proportion of myrmecophiles comparable to that found in legume-feeders (more-than 90%), notably the families Crassulaceae, Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, Melastomataceae, Combretaceae, Anacardiaceae, Sapindaceae, Rhamnaceae (all in the subclass Rosidae), & others.  In contrast, plant families such as Polygonaceae, Fagaceae, or Ericaceae support distinctly fewer myrmecophiles.  Roughly half of all myrmecophilous species are not known to feed on legumes, & less than 1/3 of the myrmecophiles are specialized legume feeders.  Furthermore, there is no stronger preference for legumes among obligate myrmecophiles in comparison to facultatively ant-associated lycaenids, & various highly myrmecophilous clades show a very low affinity to legumes.  These findings weaken the idea that nutritive requirements caused by myrmecophily have selected for the utilization of nitrogen-fixing leguminous hostplants.  There is also no support for the hypotheses that nitrogen-fixing hostplants other than legumes, or parasitic plants of the order Santalales, support an increased proportion of myrmecophiles.  Lycaeninae caterpillars predominantly feed on plant families rich in polyphenolics or tannins, especially in the subclass Rosidae, but more rarely utilize hostplant taxa with advanced chemical defenses such as cardenolides, alkaloids, or iridoids.  Overall, members of at least 149 plant families are utilized.  Taxonomic idiosyncrasies in hostplant relationships are common in Lycaeninae butterflies.  Plant chemistry (secondary metabolites), therefore, appears to be more important in shaping lycaenid hostplant utilization patterns than is myrmecophily.  The most distinct relations between hostplant associations & interactions with ants occur in secondarily myrmecoxenous species which mostly have restricted host-ranges & rarely feed on legumes.  The findings suggest that, instead of selection for nitrogen-fixing hostplants in myrmecophilous species, selection against myrmecophily has occurred in certain lineages that have switched to 'aberrant' hostplants.]",

Myrmecoxeny, i.e. lack of ant-association, is rare among Oriental lycaenids, but was confirmed for two species. Together with data from available literature, these findings suggest that in tropical rainforests the proportion of obligate myrmecophiles is not much higher than in the northern temperate zone.

Three aspects of diversity are investigated: diversity of life-habits, speciation events, & diversity of lycaenid faunas.  Myrmecophilous interactions may have numerous & variable effects on life-history elements at all developmental phases of lycaenid butterflies, especially during the caterpillar & adult stage.  Direct effects on the frequency of speciation events, claimed in the literature, are restricted to obligate myrmecophiles, which account for less than 20% of the world fauna.  The influence of myrmecophily on speciation is more limited than previously thought.  Investigations in Malaysian rainforests indicate that varying types of interactions with ants do enhance the structuring of species-rich assemblages of lycaenids, e.g. as a mechanism of resource partitioning.  Therefore, myrmecophily does help to increase diversity on all levels considered.  A comparison with trophobiotic Homoptera reveals that similar patterns can be expected, whereas among inquilines of ant nests, such as myrmecophilous beetles, the effect of specific ant-associations on speciation rates is probably much more distinct than among trophobiotic Lepidoptera or Homoptera.]",

    "abstract": "*[Associations with ants, termed myrmecophily, are widespread in the butterfly family Lycaenidae, ranging from mere co-existence to more or less specific mutualistic or even parasitic interactions.  Secretions of specialized epidermal glands are crucial for mediating the interactions.  Transfer of nutrients, carbohydrates, amino acids, from butterfly larvae to ants plays a major role, but manipulative communication with the help of odor signals is also involved.  By means of myrmecophily, lycaenid butterflies largely escape ant predation.  Certain species gain protection through attendant ants or achieve developmental benefits from ant-attendance.  Benefits to the ants range from minimal to substantial food rewards.  While most lycaenid species maintain facultative relationships with a variety of ant genera, highly specific & obligatory associations have convergently evolved in a number of butterfly lineages.  As a corollary, communication systems are largely unspecific in the former, but may be highly specialized in the latter.  The sophisticated communication between obligate myrmecophiles & their host ants is tightly connected with the evolutionary rise of specialized life-cycles.  This is a source of augmenting diversity within the butterflies.]",

    "abstract": "Myrmecophily provides various examples of how social structures can be overcome to exploit vast and well-protected resources. Ant nest beetles (Paussinae) are particularly well suited for ecological and evolutionary considerations in the context of association with ants because life habits within the subfamily range from free-living and predatory in basal taxa to obligatory myrmecophily in derived Paussini.  Adult Paussini are accepted in the ant society, although parasitising the colony by preying on ant brood. Host species mainly belong to the ant families Myrmicinae and Formicinae, but at least several paussine genera are not host-specific. Morphological adaptations, such as special glands and associated tufts of hair (trichomes), characterise Paussini as typical myrmecophiles and lead to two different strategical types of body shape: while certain Paussini rely on the protective type with less exposed extremities, other genera access ant colonies using glandular secretions and trichomes (symphiles type). We compare these adaptations with other taxonomic groups of insects by joining contemporary research and early sources and discuss the possibility of an attracting or appeasing effect of the secretion. Species that are ignored by their host ants might use chemical mimicry instead. Furthermore, vibrational signals may contribute to ant-beetle communication, and chemical signals have proven to play a role in host finding. The powerful defense chemistry of paussines as \"bombardier beetles\" is not used in contact with host ants. We attempt to trace the evolution of myrmecophily in paussines by reviewing important aspects of the association between paussine beetles and ants, i.e. morphological and potential chemical adaptations, life cycle, host specificity, alimentation, parasitism and sound production.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic associations are found across all kingdoms of life and are integral to ecosystem structure and function. Central to understanding the ecology and evolution of symbiotic relationships is an understanding of what influences host range; the number of host species that a symbiont can utilize. Despite the importance of host breadth among symbionts, relatively little is known about how the relationship that a symbiont has with its host influences its host range. Additionally, contrasts among interaction types often involve diverse groups of unrelated host species. To test how host range varied with interaction type, we used a global synthesis of over 1600 species of myrmecophiles, those organisms that have symbiotic associations with ants. We used an indexed literature search to collate known myrmecophile species and their hosts, and to determine how two degrees of dependence (facultative, obligate) and four types of relationships (mutualism, commensalism, kleptoparasitism, and parasitism) among myrmecophiles and their hosts influence host range. Our synthesis showed that, overall, myrmecophiles exhibited a high degree of host specialization, and facultatively dependent myrmecophiles had broader host ranges than those with obligate interactions. Myrmecophiles with mutualistic relationships had broader host ranges than neutral or antagonistic relationships. Additionally, lepidopteran myrmecophiles exhibited broader host range patterns than other taxa. Our results have important implications for how symbiotic associations are understood, with positive relationships (mutualisms) associated with broader host range, and antagonistic relationships (parasitism) associated with narrow host range.          *[Elgar MA, Allan RA (2006) incorrectly listed as Edgar MA, Allan RA (2006).]",

    "abstract": "*[In this thesis, I wanted to highlight the diversity of red wood ant associated guest fauna in order to emphasize the role of red wood ants in the maintenance & conservation of forest biodiversity.  I examined the underlying factors shaping the community composition & species richness of associates.  Particularly, I studied the factors determining the occurrence of the globally vulnerable shining guest ant (Formicoxenus nitidulus), an obligate social parasite of mound building wood ants.  I also studied the effects of clear felling on ant nest mounds as well as on the ant-associated beetle community.  A total of 85 different taxa (mostly beetles), including 26 myrmecophiles (species dependent on ants), were identified in the course of this thesis.  One unexpected discovery was the sawtoothed grain beetle (Oryzaephilus surinamensis), which has so far only been recorded as an indoor pest species in Finland.  Overall, I found that species richness & occurrence of associates were negatively associated with isolation of the nest mounds.  The occurring probability of the guest ant F. nitidulus increased with decreasing isolation & increasing nest mound size. The guest ant was more likely to occur in the nests of the polydomous (multi-nest colonies) Formica polyctena than the monodomous (single nest colonies) Formica rufa.  Also, local spreading along the connecting trails between nests in polydomous host colonies seems to be important to F. nitidulus.  I found that Formica aquilonia nest mounds in clear fells had significantly lower surface layer moisture content than nests in forests, which reduces the nests' thermal capacity.  Though species richness & community composition of beetles did not greatly differ between clearings & forests, total abundance was lower in clear fell nests.  Furthermore, total species richness & abundance as well as myrmecophile abundance decreased with decreasing moisture content.  I investigated only the short-term effects of clear felling in active nest mounds.  However, nests in clear fells have a high tendency of being abandoned, which will inevitably be detrimental to myrmecophiles.  How the associate community develops in the long-term in the nests surviving clear felling needs further study.]",

    "abstract": "Ant nests are rich with various other fauna, and they may be seen as resources for these guest species. We studied the species richness and abundance of ant guests in the nests of Formica polyctena by addressing the resource concentration hypothesis, which predicts that nests in high densities would support higher species richness and abundance of specialised guests. In 12 nests we found 1562 individuals belonging to 70 taxa, of which beetles were the most species rich group. The resource concentration hypothesis was supported, as we found the species richness to be higher in nests with close neighbours. There was no relationship between the abundance of associates and the nearest neighbour distance. Non-parametric methods were applied for total species richness estimation. These suggest that additional sampling would yield more associate species. In addition, we studied the similarity of the species composition in the nests and how the distance between the nests correlates with it. Overall, nests from the same area appeared to be most similar with each other. A significant negative trend between geographical distance and similarity of the species composition was found when all species and non-myrmecophiles were tested. For maintaining and conserving high arthropod diversity in temperate and boreal forests, forest management practices preserving dense red wood ant populations should be used if the habitat cannot be protected.",

    "abstract": "Clonal organisms with occasional sex are important for our general understanding of the costs and benefits that maintain sexual reproduction. Cyclically parthenogenetic aphids are highly variable in their frequency of sexual reproduction. However, studies have mostly focused on free-living aphids above ground, whereas dispersal constraints and dependence on ant-tending may differentially affect the costs and benefits of sex in subterranean aphids. Here, we studied reproductive mode and dispersal in a community of root aphids that are obligately associated with the ant Lasius flavus. We assessed the genetic population structure of four species (Geoica utricularia, Tetraneura ulmi, Forda marginata and Forda formicaria) in a Dutch population and found that all species reproduce predominantly if not exclusively asexually, so that populations consist of multiple clonal lineages. We show that population viscosity is high and winged aphids rare, consistent with infrequent horizontal transmission between ant host colonies. The absence of the primary host shrub (Pistacia) may explain the absence of sex in three of the studied species, but elm trees (Ulmus) that are primary hosts of the fourth species (T. ulmi) occurred within a few km of the study population. We discuss the extent to which obligate ant-tending and absence of primary hosts may have affected selection for permanent parthenogenesis, and we highlight the need for further study of these aphids in Southern Europe where primary hosts may occur close to L. flavus populations, so that all four root aphid species would have realistic opportunities for completing their sexual life cycle.",

Its nests provide a stable, food rich, and temperature and humidity controlled environment, utilized by a wide range of species, called myrmecophiles. Here, we used the high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina platform for identification of the microbiome profiles of six selected myrmecophilous beetles (Dendrophilus pygmaeus, Leptacinus formicetorum, Monotoma angusticollis, Myrmechixenus subterraneus, Ptenidium formicetorum and Thiasophila angulata) and their host F. polyctena. Analyzed bacterial communities consisted of a total of 23 phyla, among which Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were the most abundant. Two known endosymbionts\u0014Wolbachia and Rickettsia\u0014were found in the analyzed microbiome profiles and Wolbachia was dominant in bacterial communities associated with F. polyctena, M. subterraneus, L. formicetorum and P. formicetorum (>90% of reads). In turn, M. angusticollis was co-infected with both Wolbachia and Rickettsia, while in the microbiome of T. angulata, the dominance of Rickettsia has been observed. The relationships among the microbiome profiles were complex, and no relative abundance pattern common to all myrmecophilous beetles tested was observed. However, some subtle, species-specific patterns have been observed for bacterial communities associated with D. pygmaeus, M. angusticollis, and T. angulata.",

    "abstract": "Myrmecophilous insects depend on their ant hosts during at least part of their life cycle. Lasius ants appear to be primarily involved as host in myrmecophilous interactions, especially with aphids and beetles, e.g. staphylinid. Pella laticollis is a rove beetle having a close ecological association with Lasius fuliginosus, which is correlated to its behavior adapted to avoid attack. Microorganisms can also play an important role in the maintenance of such relationships. We used 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform to identify the bacterial communities associated with larvae and adults of both L. fuliginosus and P. laticollis. In addition, we determined the microbiota profiles of the nest-carton, an organic material lining the nest chambers. We obtained more than two million good quality reads. Taxonomic annotation showed that the profiles consisted of a total of 20 phyla, among which Proteobacteria was the most abundant. The samples were grouped according to the host\u0019s developmental stage or the nest material, and the differences between those groups were significant. Only the microbiota of L. fuliginosus larvae and adults did not differ significantly. Analyses at the genus level indicated a heightened abundance of Pseudomonas in the insects' profiles. The bacterial communities associated with the nest-carton included bacterial genera recorded from soil and dead wood. The profiles showed the presence of two well-known endosymbiotic bacteria, namely, Rickettsia and Wolbachia. According to our findings, the bacterial communities associated with larvae and adults of both L. fuliginosus and P. laticollis formed clusters according to the host\u0019s identity and its developmental stage. The profiles determined for the nest-carton formed a separate group. Our study is in line with a new research trend that is focusing on microbiota associated not only with ants, but also with myrmecophiles and ant nests inhabited by those species.",

    "abstract": "Thorictus beetles of the Dermestidae are obligate myrmecophiles. To understand how these beetles are integrated into and tolerated by their host colonies, the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of different species of the Thorictus castaneus group that are generally associated with Cataglyphis were examined. The beetles are characterized by small amounts of cuticular hydrocarbons, which render them partly chemically 'insignificant'. They also have the same cuticular hydrocarbon profiles as their hosts and thus likely use chemical mimicry to evade worker hostility but, like slaves in slave-maker species, they maintain some partial chemical identity. Thorictus martinezi from Burkina Faso were immediately adopted by conspecific colonies of their host, Cataglyphis sp. aff. bicolor, but were never adopted by colonies of other species (i.e. Cataglyphis viatica and Formica selysi). Thorictus buigasi from Morocco also mimicked the chemical profile of its host, C. viatica, but, in contrast to T. martinezi, individuals were adopted by colonies of Cataglyphis velox from Spain. This result can be explained by the similarity between the hydrocarbon profiles of C. viatica and C. velox, which may facilitate adoptions. T. buigasi beetles remained in Formica selysi colonies for some time but were ultimately rejected, probably due to their very different hydrocarbon profiles. In contrast, they were sometimes adopted by Camponotus herculeanus colonies and eventually chemically matched their new hosts, probably by passive camouflage. These data suggest that Thorictus of castaneus group myrmecophily is the result of coevolution with Cataglyphis hosts and that the mimicry is plastic, such that beetles can live with different hosts if the hosts show very limited CHC differences.",

    "abstract": "*Antennal communications are present in all groups of social insects. They are very important in several aspects of social life: recognition, alarm, recruitment of nestmates for exploitation of a food source or emigration, food-exchange through trophallaxis. Antennal communications are based on simple motor patterns: antennal beatings on the nestmates. The litterature concerning this problem leads us to distinguish two main aspects of evolution: - In Formicidae, during recruitment phenomena, highly stereotyped behavioral sequences called 'invitation behavior' are associated with trail pheromones. Invitation behavior is affective alone only in some species of the Ponerinae. In some species which uses chemical mass recruitment, invitation behavior seems to be a relic. We find several degrees of evolution in the same genera (for ex. Camponotus). - During trophallaxis, antennal beatings are associated with movements of the forelegs, for mechanical stimulation of the nestmates. Antennal stimulation is also used for milking aphids or sollicitation of larvae, and it is mimed by myrmecophiles.

    "abstract": "Ants patrol foliage and exert a strong selective pressure on herbivorous insects, being their primary predators. As ants are chemically oriented, some organisms that interact with them (myrmecophiles) use chemical strategies mediated by their cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to deal with ants. Thus, a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of the mutualistic interactions between myrmecophiles and ants depends on the accurate recognition of these chemical strategies. Few studies have examined whether treehoppers may use an additional strategy called chemical camouflage to reduce ant aggression, and none considered highly polyphagous pest insects. We analyzed whether the chemical similarity of the CHC profiles of three host plants from three plant families (Fabaceae, Malvaceae, and Moraceae) and the facultative myrmecophilous honeydew-producing treehopper Aetalion reticulatum (Hemiptera: Aetalionidae), a pest of citrus plants, may play a role as a proximate mechanism serving as a protection against ant attacks on plants. We found a high similarity (>80%) between the CHCs of the treehoppers and two of their host plants. The treehoppers acquire CHCs through their diet, and the chemical similarity varies according to host plant. Chemical camouflage on host plants plays a role in the interaction of treehoppers with their ant mutualistic partners.           *[No specific ants mentioned.]",

    "abstract": "*[A large dataset of various associations between silverfish (order Zygentoma) & Formicidae is presented obtained from samples collected across continental Spain.  Associations have been detected in 693 ant nests of 14 different genera of Formicidae, hosting 2 species of Zygentoma belonging to the family Nicoletiidae (subfamily Atelurinae) & 17 species of Lepismatidae (subfamily Lepismatinae).  A high diversity of interactions has been found: Overall, 157 different associations (species of Zygentoma to species of ants) have been recorded.  Comparing our data with the existent literature, 41 of these pairs are reported here for the first time.  A quantitative criterion is being followed to classify taxa of Spanish Zygentoma occurring in ant nests.  According to their obligateness, 3 groups are distinguished: xenomyrmecophiles, occasional, & strict myrmecophiles.  In the latter, at least 2 degrees of host specificity (generalist & specialist species) are distinguished.  A cladogram of Spanish Lepismatinae places specialist silverfish as the more apomorphic taxa.  The number & type of guest species of the most frequent ant genera & the number of individuals & species per nest are compared & the Zygentoma-Formicidae quantitative network is analyzed.  In conclusion, more than one mode of association occurs between Zygentoma & ants in the Western Palaearctic.  Nests of Messor Forel, 1890 host a lot of species of silverfish, most of which are specialists that have likely developed a higher level of integration & are far from strict parasites.  A second group of associations is represented by several common ant genera such as Camponotus Mayr, 1861, or Formica Linnaeus, 1758, which mostly host a few species of myrmecophilous Zygentoma (considered generalists).  The position of Aphaenogaster Mayr, 1853, is intermediate between these 2 opposite groups (in the latter 2 groups, silverfish are likely parasites).]",

    "abstract": "Ant nest beetles (Carabidae, Paussinae, Paussini; Paussus) are renowned myrmecophiles, mostly known for their bizarre and diverse antennal shape. While little is known about their development, behavior and host range, we do know they spend most of their lives inside ant nests, feeding upon the hemolymph of ant brood and teneral workers. Recent findings suggest these beetles use a surprisingly complex strategy for interacting and deceiving ants. They have managed to break into multiple communication channels that ants use to recognize and communicate with one another in order to deceive the ants and profit from the rich resources of the nest. Mounting evidence from structural, chemical, acoustic, and behavioral studies support the hypothesis that Paussus is among the most highly integrated parasite of social insects known to date.",

    "abstract": "While ant colonies serve as host to a diverse array of myrmecophiles, few parasitoids are able to exploit this vast resource. A notable exception is the wasp family Eucharitidae, which is the only family of insects known to exclusively parasitize ants. Worldwide, approximately 700 Eucharitidae species attack five subfamilies across the ant phylogeny. Our goal is to uncover the pattern of eucharitid diversification, including timing of key evolutionary events, biogeographic patterns and potential cophylogeny with ant hosts. We present the most comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Eucharitidae to date, including 44 of the 53 genera and fossil-calibrated estimates of divergence dates. Eucharitidae arose approximately 50 Ma after their hosts, during the time when the major ant lineages were already established and diversifying. We incorporate host association data to test for congruence between eucharitid and ant phylogenies and find that their evolutionary histories are more similar than expected at random. After a series of initial host shifts, clades within Eucharitidae maintained their host affinity. Even after multiple dispersal events to the New World and extensive speciation within biogeographic regions, eucharitids remain parasitic on the same ant subfamilies as their Old World relatives, suggesting host conservatism despite access to a diverse novel ant fauna.

Among myrmecophiles, beetles exhibit the most diverse behavioral & morphological adaptations to a life with ants.  These various associations have historically been grouped into discrete, but overlapping behavioral categories, many of which are still used in the modern literature.  While these behavioral classifications provide a rich foundation for the study of ant-beetle symbioses, the application of these systems in future studies may be less than effective.  Since morphological characteristics often provide the only information of myrmecophilous beetles, they should be studied in a species-by-species fashion, as behavioral data are often limited or unavailable.  Similarly, behavioral studies should focus on the target species at hand, avoiding discrete classification schemes.  I formally propose the rejection of any classification scheme, in order to promote future studies of myrmecophily in both taxonomic & evolutionary studies.]",

    "abstract": "Most studies aiming to determine the beneficial effect of ants on plants simply consider the effects of the presence or exclusion of ants on plant yield. This approach is often inadequate, however, as ants interact with both non-tended herbivores and tended Homoptera.  Moreover, the interaction with these groups of organisms is dependent on ant density, and these functional relationships are likely to be non-linear. A model is presented here that segregates plant herbivores into two categories depending on the sign of their numerical response to ants (myrmecophiles increase with ants, non-tended herbivores decline). The changes in these two components of herbivores with increasing ant density and the resulting implications for ant-plant mutualisms are considered. It emerges that a wide range of ant densities needs to be considered as the interaction sign (mutualism or parasitism) and strength is likely to change with ant density. The model is used to interpret the results of an experimental study that varied levels of Aphis fabae infestation and Lasius niger ant attendance on Vicia faba bean plants. Increasing ant density consistently reduced plant fitness and thus, in this location, the interaction between the ants and the plant can be considered parasitic. In the Vicia faba system, these costs of ants are unlikely to be offset by other beneficial agents (e.g., parasitoids), which also visit extrafloral nectaries.",

Clades that are primitively predatory, small in body size, & possess defensive strategies, either physical or chemical, that permit some degree of protection from policing worker ants, appear to be preadapted to evolve myrmecophily repeatedly.  I propose that the mode of colony exploitation employed during the initial phase of evolution, combined with the potential evolvability of the body plan, has important consequences for subsequent evolutionary steps.  These parameters influence if & how different taxa undergo specialization to colony life & the mechanisms the most advanced myrmecophiles employ to achieve social integration.

Here, we report the earliest known morphologically specialized & apparently obligate myrmecophile, in Early Eocene (~52 million years old) Cambay amber from India.  Protoclaviger trichodens gen.nov. et sp.nov. is a stem-group member of Clavigeritae, a speciose supertribe of pselaphine rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) heavily modified for myrmecophily via reduced mouthparts for trophallaxis with worker ants, brush-like trichomes that exude appeasement compounds, & fusions of many body & antennal segments.  Protoclaviger captures a transitional stage in the evolutionary development of this novel body plan, most evident in its still-distinct abdominal tergites.  The Cambay paleobiota marks one of the first occurrences in the fossil record of a significant presence of modern ants.

    "abstract": "*[We focus on relatively unspecialized myrmecophiles, which probably outnumber the group of specialized species.  Our main model system was the myrmecophile microcosm in the nests of red wood ants (Formica rufa group).  Our second model system was an association of co- inhabiting (= parabiosis) African ant species that also houses a community of myrmecophile species.  In chapter 1, we reviewed the diverse group of myrmecophiles that can be found in association with red wood ants (RWAs).  In total, 125 species were listed & the biology of the different arthropod groups was discussed.  The main part of this thesis deals with biotic interactions in ant nests, but we examined first in chapter 2 the effect of abiotic interactions on myrmecophile communities.  In accordance with metapopulation theory, myrmecophile species richness per unit volume was negatively correlated with increasing nest mound isolation.  In chapter 4, a surprising complex food web was found in the red wood ant microcosm, with most myrmecophiles parasitizing on ant brood & ant prey.  In addition, multiple trophic predator-prey links among the myrmecophiles were encountered.  The results of the stable isotope analyses complemented the findings of direct feeding tests & indicated the existence of multiple trophic levels.  In chapter 3, another mechanism that might counter the high parasitic pressure was shown.  We demonstrated that small nurses in red wood ant colonies are the most aggressive & most efficient defenders of brood against small, intranidal, parasitic myrmecophiles.  The red wood ant myrmecophiles showed a different level of integration, with some species preferring the dense brood chambers, whereas others avoided the brood chambers & lived at the edge of the nest (chapter 5).  In the community of red wood ant myrmecophiles tested in chapter 6, most species had distinct chemical profiles.  Some of them carried low concentrations of compounds, but a significant part showed no disguise at all.  Many red wood ant myrmecophiles are persecuted, but in chapter 7 we reported that survival of 3 obligate myrmecophilous beetles over a period of 20 days was not different from a control set-up without ants.  However, reduced survival was detected for a facultative myrmecophile in presence of red wood ants.  Survival analyses in the presence of 9 different ant species showed that the 3 beetles survived better in presence of larger-bodied ant species, & was highest in presence of its preferred host F. rufa, which also has relatively large workers.  The interactions in the parabiotic nests of the large Platythyrea conradti & tiny Strumigenys maynei ants were described in chapter 8.  The parabiotic association tended to be mutualistic as P. conradti benefits from the supreme defence capabilities of S. maynei against alien ants & intranidal myrmecophiles.  S. maynei benefits from the prey that thrive in the organic material carried to the nest by P. conradti.]",

    "abstract": "Living in close association with other organisms has proven to be a widespread and successful strategy in nature. Some communities are completely driven by symbiotic associations and therefore, intimate relationships among the partners can be expected. Here, we analyzed in\u0010depth the food web of a particularly rich community of arthropods found in strict association with European red wood ants (Formica rufa group). We studied the trophic links between different ant\u0010associated myrmecophiles and food sources associated with the host ant, but also tested predator-prey links among myrmecophiles themselves. Our approach combined direct feeding tests and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses for a large number of myrmecophiles. The results of the direct feeding tests reveal a complex food web. Most myrmecophiles were found to parasitize on ant brood. Moreover, we encountered multiple trophic predator- prey links among the myrmecophiles. The results of the stable isotope analyses complement these findings and indicate the existence of multiple trophic levels and trophic isotopic niche compartmentalization. delta15N values were strongly correlated with the trophic levels based on the direct tests, reflecting that delta15N values of myrmecophiles increased with higher trophic levels. This strong correlation underlines the strength of stable isotopes as a powerful tool to assess trophic levels. In addition, the stable isotope data suggest that most species only facultatively prey on ant brood. The presence of numerous trophic interactions among symbionts clearly contrasts with the traditional view of social insects nests as offering an enemy\u0010free space for symbionts. Interestingly, the ant host can indirectly benefit from these interactions because brood predators are also preyed upon by other myrmecophiles. Overall, this study provides unique insights into the complex interactions in a small symbiont microcosm system and suggests that the interactions between host and symbiont might be mediated by other symbionts in the same community.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Species interactions may affect spatial dynamics when the movement of one species is determined by the presence of another one. The most direct species-dependence of dispersal is vectored, usually cross-kingdom, movement of immobile parasites, diseases or seeds by mobile animals. Joint movements of species should, however, not be vectored by definition, as even mobile species are predicted to move together when they are tightly connected in symbiont communities. METHODS: We studied concerted movements in a diverse and heterogeneous community of arthropods (myrmecophiles) associated with red wood ants. We questioned whether joint-movement strategies eventually determine and speed-up community succession. RESULTS: We recorded an astonishingly high number of obligate myrmecophiles outside red wood ant nests. They preferentially co-moved with the host ants as the highest densities were found in locations with the highest density of foraging red wood ants, such as along the network of ant trails. These observations suggest that myrmecophiles resort to the host to move away from the nest, and this to a much higher extent than hitherto anticipated. Interestingly, functional groups of symbionts displayed different dispersal kernels, with predatory myrmecophiles moving more frequently and further from the nest than detritivorous myrmecophiles. We discovered that myrmecophile diversity was lower in newly founded nests than in mature red wood ant nests. Most myrmecophiles, however, were able to colonize new nests fast suggesting that the heterogeneity in mobility does not affect community assembly. CONCLUSIONS: We show that co-movement is not restricted to tight parasitic, or cross-kingdom interactions. Movement in social insect symbiont communities may be heterogeneous and functional group-dependent, but clearly affected by host movement. Ultimately, this co-movement leads to directional movement and allows a fast colonisation of new patches, but not in a predictable way. This study highlights the importance of spatial dynamics of local and regional networks in symbiont metacommunities, of which those of symbionts of social insects are prime examples.",

    "abstract": "*[Here, we compiled a detailed database on naturally occurring ant-symbiont networks in Europe to identify factors that affect symbiont network topology.  These networks host an unrivalled diversity of macrosymbiotic associations, spanning the entire mutualism-antagonism continuum, including: (i) myrmecophiles (commensalistic & parasitic arthropods); (ii) trophobionts (mutualistic aphids, scale insects, planthoppers, & caterpillars); (iii) social parasites (parasitic ant species); (iv) parasitic helminths; & (v) parasitic fungi.  We dissected network topology to investigate what determines host specificity, symbiont species richness, & the capacity of different symbiont types to switch hosts.  We found 722 macrosymbionts (multicellular symbionts) associated with European ants.  Symbiont type explained host specificity & the average relatedness of the host species.  Social parasites were associated with few hosts that were phylogenetically highly related, whereas the other symbiont types interacted with a larger number of hosts across a wider taxonomic distribution.  The hosts of trophobionts were the least phylogenetically related across all symbiont types.  Colony size, host range, & habitat type predicted total symbiont richness: ant hosts with larger colony size, a larger distribution range, or with a wider habitat range contained more symbiont species.  However, we found that different sets of host factors affected diversity in the different types of symbionts.  Ecological factors, such as colony size, host range, & niche width predominantly determined myrmecophile species richness, whereas host phylogeny was the most important predictor of mutualistic trophobiont, social parasite, & parasitic helminth species richness.  Lastly, we found that hosts with a common biogeographic history support a more similar community of symbionts.  Phylogenetically related hosts also shared more trophobionts, social parasites, & helminths, but not myrmecophiles.]",

    "abstract": "The importance of Eurasian red wood ants (RWAs) (Formica rufa group) in forest and heath ecosystems has long been recognized. One key function of RWAs is the role of their nests in supporting an intriguing ecosystem of a highly diverse group of obligate myrmecophiles and facultative guests. In this review we list 125 obligate arthropod myrmecophiles that occur in RWA mounds or in the near vicinity of the mounds. More than 40% of them are Coleoptera, but also Hemiptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Acari and Araneae are well represented. RWAs are estimated to be the primary hosts for 49 species. 24 species were hitherto only recorded to be associated with RWAs, 12 with both RWAs and other mound-building Formica species and 9 were found to be associated with both mound-building and non-mound-building Formica species. The remaining associates are less specific and can be found with other ant genera or ant subfamilies. Other mound-building Formica ants (Coptoformica, F. uralensis and F. truncorum) support fewer species, most of which are known to also occur with RWAs. We discuss the biology of the different obligate myrmecophilous groups and give general notes on the facultative guests found in RWA mounds. We stress the importance of the conservation of RWAs as hosts of one of the richest and diverse associations known to date in insects.",

    "abstract": "In many species, specialized defence traits and strategies are crucial for surviving enemy attacks or securing resources. In numerous social insect lineages, a morphologically and behaviourally distinct soldier caste specializes in colony defence, with larger foragers typically engaging most in the aggressive defence of the colony against external threats. We hypothesized, however, that specialization in aggression could show vastly different patterns in the context of the defence against small intranidal parasites that prey on brood. This is because we expected that small, intranidal nurse workers could be better suited to defend against these parasitic myrmecophiles (=ant associates) due to their better matching size, high encounter rate and the high task switching costs that would occur if foragers had to carry out this task. Here, we present data that support this hypothesis from a study on specialization in defence against two parasites in the red wood ant Formica rufa. In particular, we show that small workers displayed the strongest aggressive behaviour towards the parasitic rove beetle Thiasophila angulata and the spider Thyreosthenius biovatus, and present evidence that small workers were better at preventing brood predation than larger workers. In addition, there was worker task specialization in defensive behaviour, with nurses and workers at nest entrances being more aggressive towards T. angulata than extranidal foragers. We argue that this context-dependent specialization in aggression and nest defence was likely to be important in favouring the pronounced worker polymorphism observed in both this and other ant species and discuss our findings in relation to models for the evolution of division of labour and caste polymorphism in insect societies.",

    "abstract": "Red wood ants support a diverse community of myrmecophiles in their nest mounds. Given that nest mounds provide fairly constant and distinct habitat patches for myrmecophiles, metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics can be expected to play an important role in structuring myrmecophile communities. Here, we investigate how site, site size (i.e. number of mounds per site), mound isolation, mound size, moisture, pH and red wood ant host (Formica rufa and Formica polyctena) affect the (meta)community composition and species richness. We demonstrate that community composition is structured by site and within-site isolation. In addition, species richness per unit volume is negatively correlated with increasing nest mound isolation. Mound size and site size at a higher spatial scale had no effect on community composition or diversity. The latter suggests that few mounds are required to support the minimum viable metapopulation size. We did not find support that the environmental variables mound moisture and pH affect the myrmecophile community or its species richness. Finally, the communities of the two closely related wood ant species F. rufa and F. polyctena were very similar. Overall, our results demonstrate, in accordance with metapopulation theory, that isolated mounds support fewer myrmecophile species. Diverse myrmecophile metacommunities also occur in small red wood ant sites, with well connected nest mounds. We discuss the powerful potential of ant nests, and particularly red wood ant mounds, for metapopulation and metacommunity research.",

In addition, we tested whether host specificity was driven by the size of the ant host workers, because host specificity has previously been demonstrated to be inversely related to aggression towards macroparasites.  Our results show that despite regular aggressive host interactions, survival of the obligate myrmecophilous beetles over a period of 20 days was not different from a control set-up without ants.  By contrast, the facultative ant associate P. scaber hardly provoked any aggressive host response, but its survival was lower in presence of F. rufa workers compared with a control set-up without ants.  Furthermore, the data on survival in presence of 9 different ant host species show that the 3 obligate myrmecophile beetles survived better in presence of larger-bodied ant species, & that their survival was highest in presence of their preferred host F. rufa, which also has relatively large workers.  The only exception to this trend was the low survival observed in presence of the large-bodied ant Camponotus vagus (Scopoli, 1763).  Finally, species that were less successful in killing the beetles in our tests are also shown to support more myrmecophilous rove beetles in nature.]",

    "abstract": "Social insect colonies provide a valuable resource that attracts and offers shelter to a large community of arthropods. Previous research has suggested that many specialist parasites of social insects chemically mimic their host in order to evade aggression. In the present study, we carry out a systematic study to test how common such chemical deception is across a group of 22 arthropods that are associated with red wood ants (Formica rufa group). In contrast to the examples of chemical mimicry documented in some highly specialized parasites in previous studies, we find that most of the rather unspecialized red wood ant associates surveyed did not use mimicry of the cuticular hydrocarbon recognition cues to evade host detection. Instead, we found that myrmecophiles with lower cuticular hydrocarbon concentrations provoked less host aggression. Therefore, some myrmecophiles with low hydrocarbon concentrations appear to evade host detection via a strategy known as chemical insignificance. Others showed no chemical disguise at all and, instead, relied on behavioral adaptations such as particular defense or evasion tactics, in order to evade host aggression. Overall, this study indicates that unspecialized myrmecophiles do not require the matching of host recognition cues and advanced strategies of chemical mimicry, but can integrate in a hostile ant nest via either chemical insignificance or specific behavioral adaptations.",

Instead, adult Microdon associate with ants only long enough to lay eggs & will be killed and eaten by the ants, if they take too long for that task.

In general, it inhabits salt marshes & xerothermous grasslands, especially patches with low, thin vegetation.  The presence of M. curvithorax at 3 localities in the Czech Republic has been previously documented & published; specimens from another 10 localities are in the collections of P. Pech& P. Werner.  Myrmica curvithorax occurs mainly in dry, sunny, human-altered grassy biotopes.  Seventeen nests were found to contain on average 400 workers & 0.6 queen (maximum numbers were 1231 workers & 5 wingless queens).  Myrmica curvithrax seems to be an oligogynous species, & most nests had no queen.  Several ant species shared M. curvithorax biotopes (I found  Lasius niger (Linnaeus, 1758), L. flavus (Fabricius, 1782), Formica cunicularia Latreille, 1798, F. rufibarbis Fabricius, 1793, M. rugulosa Nylander, 1849, M. schencki Viereck, 1903, Solenopsis fugax (Latreille, 1798), & Tetramorium sp.).  Two of the M. curvithorax nests examined contained S. fugax workers.  M. curvithorax probably regularly hunts & eats L. flavus.  Concerning myrmecophiles, I recorded Atelura formicaria Heyden, 1853, Platyarthrus hoffmannseggii Brandt, 1833, & undetermined aphids inside nests.]",

    "abstract": "Identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for the maintenance and protection of biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where biodiversity continues to be lost at alarming rates. Surveys and research on umbrella species can provide efficient and effective approaches to identify potential areas for conservation at small geographical scales. Army ants of the genus Eciton are keystone species in neotropical forests due to their major role as top predators and due to the numerous vertebrate- and invertebrate associated species that depend upon their colonies for survival. These associates range from the iconic army ant-following birds to a wide range of arthropod groups, some of which have evolved intricate morphological, behavioural and/or chemical strategies to conceal their presence and integrate into the colony life. Furthermore, Eciton colonies require large forested areas that support a diverse leaf litter prey community and several field-based and genetic studies have demonstrated the negative consequences of forest fragmentation for the long-term maintenance of these colonies. Therefore, Eciton species will not only act as umbrella for their associates but also for many other species in neotropical forests, in particular for those that require a large extent of forest. This review summarises past and recent accounts of the main taxonomic groups found associated with Eciton colonies, as well research assessing the impact of forest fragmentation on this army ant, to encourage the adoption of Eciton army ants as umbrella species for the identification of priority areas for conservation and assessments of the effect of disturbance in neotropical forests.",

    "abstract": "Colonies of neotropical army ants of the genus Eciton Latreille offer some of the most captivating examples of intricate interactions between species, with hundreds of associated species already described in colonies of Eciton burchellii Westwood. Among this plethora of species found with Eciton colonies, two genera of staphylinid beetles, Ecitomorpha Wasmann, and Ecitophya Wasmann, have evolved to mimic the appearance and parallel the colouration of the most abundant ant worker cast. Here, we study for the first time the association of these ant-mimicking beetles with their ant host in an evolutionary and population genetics framework. The central emphasis is on colonies of E. burchellii, the only Eciton species that harbours both genera of ant-mimicking beetles. Phylogenetic and population structure analyses using the same mtDNA COI region (802 bp) for ants and beetles indicated that speciation patterns of the myrmecophiles were congruent with specialization to a particular Eciton (sub)species. Therefore, current taxonomic treatments of Eciton and its Ecitomorpha and Ecitophya associates need revision. Molecular clock analyses suggested that diversification of the Eciton hosts pre-date that of their guests, with a possible earlier association of Ecitophya (found with a large number of Eciton species) than with Ecitomorpha (found only with E. burchellii colonies). Population-level analyses revealed that patterns of diversification for the myrmecophiles are also consistent with specialisation to a particular host across broad geographical areas but not at small geographical scales, with gene flow within each species found between host colonies, even across landscape features that are strong barriers for Eciton female-mediated gene flow.",

    "abstract": "*[The caterpillars of many Lepidoptera are neither attacked nor tended by ants, but nevertheless appear to be obligately ant-associated & benefit from the enemy-free space created by ants.  Obligate myrmecophiles that do not attract ants through stridulatory or chemical signaling are limited to habitats, where ants are reliably present for other reasons, either among ant-attended hemipterans, on ant-plants, or around ant nests.  Particularly in the tropics, obligate ant associates that passively coexist with ants are more diverse than previously recognized, including, for example, hundreds of African species in the lycaenid subfamily Poritiinae.  Mutualists & parasites of ants have been reported in 11 families: Tineidae, Tortricidae, Cyclotornidae, Coleophoridae, Crambidae, Erebidae, Notodontidae, Hesperiidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae, and Riodinidae.  Altogether, myrmecophily has originated at least 30 times in Lepidoptera, & many groups may remain undiscovered.  The butterfly families Lycaenidae & Riodinidae contain the vast majority of ant-associated species: larvae of at least 3841 (71%) of the ~5390 described Lycaenidae & 308 (20%) of the ~1562 described Riodinidae are known or inferred to be ant-associated,.  Both families possess specialized, convergently developed exocrine glands & stridulatory devices to communicate with ants.  Many caterpillar-ant relationships previously characterized as mutualisms may actually be parasitic, as caterpillars can manipulate ants & ultimately exert a fitness cost.  In the family Lycaenidae, highly specialized & obligate ant associations are found largely in the Old World tropics, Australia, & Southern Africa, where the stoichiometry of soil micronutrients, particularly sodium and phosphorus, climate, host plants, & geography may all selectively shape caterpillar-ant associations.]",

    "abstract": "Ants are an ecologically and evolutionarily diverse group, and they harbor a wide range of symbiotic microbial communities that often greatly affect their biology. Turtle ants (genus Cephalotes) engage in mutualistic relationships with gut bacteria and are exploited by microbial parasites. Studies have shown that associations among these microbial lineages and the turtle ant hosts vary geographically. However, these studies have been limited, and thorough within-species analyses of the variation and structure of these microbial communities have yet to be conducted. The giant turtle ant, Cephalotes atratus (Linnaeus 1758), is a geographically widespread, genetically diverse Neotropical species that has been sampled extensively across its geographic range, making it ideal for analysis of microbial associations. In this study, we verified the presence, genetic variation, and geographic patterns at the individual, colony, and population level of three microbial groups associated with the giant turtle ant: Wolbachia, a genus of facultative bacteria which are often parasitic, affecting host reproduction; Rhizobiales, a mutualistic order of bacteria hypothesized to be an obligate nutritional symbiont in turtle ants; and Ophiocordyceps, a genus of endoparasitic fungi infecting many arthropod species by manipulating their behavior for fungal reproduction. In this study, we found varying degrees of prevalence for two distantly related genotypes (haplogroups) of Wolbachia and high degree of prevalence of Rhizobiales across colonies with little genetic variation. In addition, we found low occurrence of Ophiocordyceps. This study highlights a key first step in understanding the diversity, distribution, and prevalence of the microbial community of C. atratus.",

They were abundant in refuse deposits & at the ends of emigration & raid columns after most or all of the ants had passed.  The number of phorids with 1 colony varied greatly & sometimes exceeded 4000.  Most species considered to be myrmecophiles were found with more than 1 ant species.  The phorids are scavengers that feed on booty refuse & dead workers discarded by army ants, but may feed also on booty & live brood within bivouacs.  Eggs laid near the beginning of a statary phase of the ants can develop into adults before the colony emigrates.  Flightless females also emerged before the large-winged males, an adaptation that would increase cross mating by keeping females in the colony and forcing some males to fly to other bivouacs.  Crematogaster, Iridomyrmex, & Pheidole brood were used as army ant food & to rear phorids in the laboratory.]",

The acoustic repertoire of the late-instar larvae of 12 lycaenid species (Polyommatinae and Lycaeninae), showing different degrees of interaction with ants, was analysed by investigating 12 acoustic parameters measured on the call fundamental unit (pulse).

    "abstract": "Ant nest beetles (Paussus L.) are ecologically fascinating and phenotypically bizarre. Obligate myrmecophiles, Paussus have undergone extreme adaptations for life with ants and their profound range of phenotypic diversity has been difficult to reconcile in a systematic framework. We conducted a detailed morphological study of Paussus utilizing novel techniques and character systems in order to discover anatomical apomorphies diagnostic of the major clades of Paussus strongly supported by molecular data. Bayesian inference (BI) of molecules alone, morphology alone and varying combinations of the two data types reveal that morphology is informative for placing Paussus species, despite the extreme phenotypic diversity and convergence prevalent in the group. We propose a new classification for Paussus based on this phylogeny. The genus Paussus is revised to include all genera, subgenera and species formerly classified as Paussus by Nagel (2003) in addition to Hylopaussus syn.n., Hylotorus syn.n. and Granulopaussus syn.n.

Between January 2016 & January 2019, 82 colonies (or parts of colonies) established in the core of the tank bromeliad Aechmea bracteata (Sw.) Griseb., 1864, were collected.  All invertebrates present in the nest chambers were recorded, & ants & their brood were inspected under a stereomicroscope for the presence of any sign of parasitism.  Natural history of some of the recorded myrmecophiles & nest associates was determined.  Results showed a diverse array of associated taxa, with organisms from 6 classes distributed in at least 43 different taxa belonging to 16 orders & 24 families.  Twelve different taxa belonging to 12 families, 8 arthropod orders & one fungus order, were encountered in direct physical association with the ant brood and / or the adults in the central part of the nest: Hymenoptera (Diapriidae, Eucharitidae), Lepidoptera (Riodinidae), Diptera (Syrphidae), Coleoptera (Staphylinidae, Tenebrionidae), Acari Mesostigmata (Laelapidae, Oplitidae), Acari Trombidiformes (Scutacaridae), Acari Sarcoptiformes (Galumnidae), Pseudoscorpiones (Chernetidae), & Hypocreales Ophiocordycipitaceae).  These specialized myrmecophiles showed diverse trophic interactions with the ants, mostly antagonistic (parasites, parasitoids, predators, cleptoparasites).  Although their prevalence was low, their combined effect upon the host population was not negligible.  Not integrated, facultative, guests included several scavengers & predators found in the refuse pile within the nest or in the periphery of the chambers: springtails, rove beetles, mites, & other small ant species that nested close to N. villosa.  With the exception of the parasitoid syrphid fly Hypselosyrphus trigonus Hull, 1937, which had been previously reported, all associations are new to science.  The diverse group of obligate myrmecophiles & facultative guests associated with this highly aggressive ant species confirms arboreal ant colonies as reservoirs of diversity & suggests that ant species with relatively small colony sizes, such as ponerines, can also harbor a high diversity of associated taxa.]",

    "abstract": "Insect societies are characterized by a relatively sophisticated division of labor; they form tightly knit groups that must effectively exclude non-members from the colony. However, the Neotropical predatory ant Ectatomma tuberculatum can harbor several specific myrmecophiles and, in particular, various eucharitid parasitoid wasp species. Adult wasps eclose in the host nests and are removed by worker ants without harm. Previous observations suggest that only a few workers perform this task. To test this hypothesis, we introduced different types of intruders, live and dead, pentane-washed broad-nosed grain weevil individuals (Caulophilus oryzae) and dead, pentane-washed eucharitids (Dilocantha lachaudii), into laboratory colonies containing individually marked workers. We recorded all encounters and behaviors until the intruders were removed. Certain workers removed intruders more frequently than expected by chance. The number of encounters with an intruder was positively correlated with the number of removals performed by the workers. For each nest, a small group of workers was identified as specialized in intruder removal. A subset of very committed workers in the specialists group that performed up to 57% of removals qualified as hyperspecialists or elite workers. The behavioral sequences differed based on the type and condition of the intruder: the sequence was more complex and included numerous aggressive behaviors (mandibular strikes and attempts at stinging) when workers encountered a live weevil. In contrast, the behavioral sequences with dead, pentane-washed insects were characterized by numerous detections through contact that did not lead to rejection and by the intruders simply being seized and removed from the nest. Overall, the data show that the ants discriminated between live and pentane-washed intruders and adjusted their behavior accordingly. This is the first demonstration in ants of both behavioral specialization and hyperspecialization in intruder removal.",

We investigated the extent to which two species of aphids (Megoura crassicauda and Aphis craccivora) and extrafloral nectaries on their host plant (Vicia faba var. minor) interact with one another for their relationships with ants. We designed an experiment where ants can choose to visit seedlings colonized by (1) M. crassicauda, (2) A. cracivora, (3) both aphid species, or (4) neither aphid species. Ants preferred A. craccivora to extrafloral nectaries and avoided tending M. crassicauda. We also analyzed the population growth of each aphid when it coexists with (1) ants, (2) the other aphid species, (3) ants and the other aphid species, or (4) neither of them. Under ant-free conditions, we detected an exploitative competition between the two aphid species. The ants had no significant effect on the population of A. craccivora, whereas they had negative effects on the population growth of M. crassicauda by attacking some individuals. When both aphids coexisted, M. crassicauda suffered ant attack more intensely because A. craccivora attracted more ants than extrafloral nectaries despite ant-repelling by M. crassicauda. On the other hand, the ants benefited A. craccivora by eliminating its competitor. To avoid ant attack, aphids may have been selected either to be more attractive to ants than other sympatric sugar sources or to repel the ants attracted to them. We hypothesize that competition among sympatric sugar sources including rival aphids and extrafloral nectaries is a factor restricting aphids to be myrmecophilous.]",

    "abstract": "There are only two Aphaenogaster species from the subterranea group in the western Mediterranean: A. ichnusa Santschi, 1925, from south-western Europe, and A. subterranea (Latreille, 1798), also occurring in central and eastern Europe. Historically, the two species have been widely misunderstood: A. ichnusa was long considered a Sardinian endemic subspecies of A. subterranea, while its continental populations were misidentified as A. subterranea s. str. Recently, A. ichnusa was elevated to species rank and its worker caste was redescribed with that of A. subterranea, allowing for their correct identification. Yet their distribution was documented in detail only for France and Sardinia. Furthermore, no morphological characters were described to distinguish the males and queens of the two species. By investigating private and museum collections, 276 new records of A. ichnusa are provided here and 154 of A. subterranea from the western Mediterranean. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative morphological characters were combined to identify their males and queens. We present the new southernmost, easternmost, and westernmost distribution limits for A. ichnusa. Based on our results, this species is widely distributed in Italy and Catalonia (Spain), also occurring on several Mediterranean islands, avoiding areas with continental climate and high altitudes. Sicily is the only island to host the less thermophilous A. subterranea, which otherwise extends westward to Galicia (Spain). Sympatric occurrence is not rare along the contact zone. Additional natural history observations are reported regarding foraging habits, associated myrmecophiles, habitat preferences, and colony structure in the two species.          *[In addition to distinguishing males & queens of A. ichnusa from those of A. subterranea, we provide identification keys that tell them apart from the other Aphaenogaster species occurring in the study area (i.e., A. cardenai, A. italica, A. ovaticeps, & species from the crocea, gibbosa, pallida, splendida, & sardoa groups.]",

We also describe how other invertebrates mimic these acoustic signals in order to coexist with ants in the case of mutualistic myrmecophiles, or, in the case of social parasites, corrupt them in order to infiltrate ant societies and exploit their resources. New data suggest that the strength of each ant-myrmecophile interaction leads to distinctive sound profiles and may be a better predictor of the similarity of sound between different myrmecophilous species than their phylogenetic distance. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary significance of vibrations produced by specialized myrmecophiles in the context of ant multimodal communication involving the use of chemical and acoustic signals in combination and identify future challenges for research including how new technology might allow a better understanding of the study systems.",

    "abstract": "The myrmecophilous hoverfly, Microdon mutabilis, is listed as a 'Rare' or 'Nationally Notable Species' in UK Red Data Books. As an obligate social parasite, feeding only from ant colonies, its life-style satisfies theoretical conditions under which cryptic speciation is predicted to evolve; namely, strong selection for nonmorphological adaptations that enhance its exploitation of a local subspecies or populations of its host. Samples of larvae and pupae in Ireland, Scotland and England showed that M. mutabilis exploits a single and different host ant species on different sites across its range. In nine southern English colonies, 95.6% of infested nests were of Myrmica scabrinodis whereas in six Irish and two Scottish colonies 100% and 94.2%, respectively, of the infested nests were of Formica lemani, despite M. scabrinodis being common at all sites. Although the adults from 'scabrinodis' (and lemani) populations are cryptic, morphometric measurements of pupae showed consistent diagnostic characters that were sufficiently distinct for these ecotypes to be classed as separate species. We conclude that M. mutabilis is the 'lemani-type' and designate the 'scabrinodis-type' as a new species, Microdon myrmicae spec. nov. Thus, one of the listed threatened species of the British Isles becomes two species, each possessing about half the number of populations and occupying half the range of the original 'species'. Each also inhabits a different serai stage within grassland or heathland, and will require a different management regime if its declining populations are to be conserved. 'M. mutabilis' is reported with other host ant species on the European continent. In the light of our results, these may prove to be additional cryptic species. We suggest that cryptic speciation is apt to evolve in species, such as myrmecophiles, endoparasites and koinobiont parasitoids, whose life-styles result in strong selection on their physiological or behavioural characters. The implications for Red Data Book classifications and for practical conservation are discussed. \u00a9 2002 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2002, 75, 291-300.",

    "abstract": "*[In Peninsular Malaysia, 10 species of lycaenid butterflies use leaf flushes or inflorescences of Saraca thaipingensis, a legume tree, for their larval host-plant.  Resource partitioning among these species  is regulated by a complex mixture of interaction patterns with ants.  Females of obligate myrmecophile species lay their eggs exclusively on trees colonized by their specific host ants.  On trees colonized by Oecophylla weaver ants, only specialist mutualists adapted to these territorial ants are able to survive, while larvae of other species are killed.  The formicine Cladomyrma petalae, which inhabits hollow twigs of the myrmecophytic host-plant, likewise precludes oviposition by female butterflies.  Lycaenid larvae confronted with this ant species never survive, but Jamides caeruleus, a concealed feeding species, escapes predation because of its larval cryptic life-habits.  Two facultative myrmecophiles associate in a mutualistic way with a wide and largely overlapping range of ant genera which forage at the extrafloral nectaries of leaf flushes.   Cheritra freja is not a myrmecophile, but is tolerated by all but the most territorial ants.  Ant-dependent host-plant selection and egg-clustering characterize the obligate myrmecophiles, whereas facultative myrmecophiles and the non-myrmecophiles distribute their eggs singly over appropriate host-plants.  Signals mediating caterpillar-ant communication are highly specialized in Drupadia theda, an obligate myrmecophile, but rather unspecific in 4 other species tested.   Altogether our observations indicate that colonization and establishment of lycaenid butterflies on S. thaipingensis trees are governed by specializations as well as opportunistic use of the resources of ants and host-plant parts.  The diversity of this species assemblage is maintained by deterministic as well as stochastic factors.]",

However, larvae of some Arhopala (Lycaenidae, Lycaeninae) species can elude the ants. Here we demonstrated that Arhopala zylda larvae showed myrmecoxeny on their myrmecophytic Macaranga host plants; they had no stable association with the plant-ants. Despite the presence of many plant-ants, A. zylda larvae were rarely attended or attacked by ants on their host plants. The plant-ants of three other myrmecophytic Macaranga species (non-hosts to A. zylda) also paid little attention to experimentally introduced A. zylda larvae. The myrmecoxeny seen in A. zylda is notable among lycaenid larvae that feed on myrmecophytes, because almost all are obligate intimate myrmecophiles.",

Red wood ants of the Formica rufa group are able to regulate the temperature of their nests to be close to the optimum, typically higher than ambient in northern latitudes and higher elevation. The mound-shaped nests are constructed from organic particles (needles, sticks, etc., plant material) and from soil particles. Nest mounds typically have a relatively dry inner structure but moister surface layer which may help the ants to insulate nests against cooling winds. Forest clear felling exposes nest mounds to direct sunlight, drier microclimate and increased wind. We studied whether clear felling affects the nest surface moisture and temperature conditions. We found that i) nest surfaces were significantly drier in clear fells than in forests, ii) a high height/diameter ratio and an increase in the nest volume increases surface dryness in clear fells but not in forests, iii) the nest temperatures relative to ambient temperature was higher in forests than in clear fells, and iv) the relative temperature increased with increasing moisture content of nest surface layer. The drying nest material and more unstable inside temperature may have adverse effects not only on the red wood ants themselves, but also for nest-dwelling soil organisms and myrmecophiles that live in red wood ant nests. In addition, changes in moisture and temperature could have effects on the rate of decomposition and nutrient turnover.",

    "abstract": "1. Many species of aphids exploit a single host-plant species and have to cope with changing environmental conditions. They often vary greatly in abundance even when feeding on the same host. In a field experiment, the bottom-up (plant quality/patch type frequency) and top-down (ant attendance/predation) effects on the abundance of four species of aphids feeding on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) were tested using a full factorial design. In addition, a model was used to examine these patch characteristics for their relative effects on the population dynamics and abundance of different aphid species. 2. Aphid numbers changed significantly depending on the quality of the host plant and the presence/absence of attending ants. The obligate myrmecophile, Metopeurum fuscoviride, was abundant on high-quality plants, while on poor quality plants or on plants without attending ants these aphids did not survive until the end of the experiment. The facultative myrmecophiles, Aphis fabae and Brachycaudus cardui, and the unattended aphid species, Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria, all reached similar peak population densities, but M. tanacetaria did best in poor quality patches. 3. Natural enemies reduced aphid numbers, but those species feeding on high-quality plants survived longer than those on poor-quality plants, which existed only for a short period of time, especially when associated with ants. Losses due to migration of winged morphs and mortality caused by parasitoids were insignificant. 4. Varying the frequency of different patch types in a model indicates that different degrees of associations with ants are favored in different environments. If the proportion of high-quality patches in a habitat is large, obligate myrmecophiles do best. On increasing the number of poor-quality patches, unattended species become more abundant. 5. The results suggest that, in spite of large species specific differences in growth rates, degree of myrmecophily or life cycle features, the temporal and spatial variability in top-down and bottom-up forces differentially affects aphid species and allows the simultaneous exploitation of a shared host-plant species.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the morphological ultrastructure of the previously unknown final larval instars of the obligate myrmecophilous rove-beetle species Lomechusa pubicollis. Diagnostic larval characters for the genus Lomechusa are proposed for the first time. At present, this paper is the only up-to-date, detailed and richly illustrated description of the external structures of larvae representing the Lomechusina subtribe. The features of L. pubicollis larvae described here correspond with the abiotic (e.g. absence of ocelli, white body) or biotic conditions (e.g. stumpy body, short legs, absence of urogomphi, dense and asymmetrical chaetotaxy, membranous cuticle) of the anthill, including the passive lifestyle resembling that of the host larvae Formica truncorum, in conjunction with a unique behaviour pattern in the myrmecophileant relationship. Morphological similarities between mature larvae of L. pubicollis and workers of Formica truncorum, the host of this myrmecophile, are also listed. The morphological structure of L. pubicollis larva with the so far best-known larvae of another myrmecophile from the Lomechusini tribe Pella laticollis living in the peripheral zones around the nest, was compared. The different lifestyles of the two species is reflected in the morphological structure of their larvae, particularly: chaetotaxy, structure of setae, ocelli, structure of mouthparts, legs and urogomphi. The characteristics of the morphological structure peculiar to L. pubicollis larva in conjunction with well-developed chemical mimicry, they enable complete adoption and integration in the ant nest, which at such an advanced level appears to be unique compared to other staphylinid myrmecophiles.",

    "abstract": "In the year 2005 studies on the Staphylinidae assemblages inhabiting ant nests of 13 ant species in the vicinities of Le|ajsk (the Sandomierska Lowland; UTM: EA87) were conducted. In total, 671 individuals of rovebeetles were collected, among which 88 Staphylinidae species were identified. The most numerous rove-beetle inhabiting the nests of the studied ant species was Thiasophila angulata. The characteristic feature of rove-beetle assemblages is superior share of myrmecophiles, despite the fact that with respect to the number of species they are in the minority. Gabrius splendidulus and Sepedophilus marshami were associated with the nests of the highest number of ant species. The best conditions for rovebeetles associated with ants are provided by moist and moulding tree trunks and nests in shape of mounds of pine needles where the highest numbers of species as well as specimens of the described beetles were caught relatively. The highest species similarity joins Staphylinidae occurring in the nests of Formica fusca and Myrmica ruginodis. Index of qualitative similarity of the examined rove-beetle assemblages was strictly connected with the structure and localization of inhabited ant nests. The dependence of relationship proximity among ants building the nests was not found. Seasonal dynamic of rove-beetle numbers showed two maxima (spring and autumn). Its course is in large part dependent on quantitative fluctuation of myrmecophilous species as well as migration of rove-beetles to wintering sites. Some relationships between ant and rove-beetles species that have not been unknown so far were observed. Among all of the recorded species 13 ones were distinguished with respect to their faunistics and as many as 73 have been discovered for the first time in the Sandomierska Lowland.",

    "abstract": "Myrmecophiles, i.e., organisms associated with ants live in a variety of ecological niches in the vicinity or inside ant colonies and employ different strategies to survive ant encounters. Because different niches are characterized by different encounter rates with host ants, strategies used to avoid ant aggressions should depend on these niches. This hypothesis was studied with three rove beetle species of the genus Pella, which are myrmecophiles of the ant Lasius fuliginosus and the non-myrmecophilous relative Drusilla canaliculata. Behavioral tests in the field revealed that Pella species are better adapted to interactions with ants than D. canaliculata, but that they use species-specific strategies in ant interactions. Pella cognata and Pella funesta avoid encounters with ants by swift movements. Chemical analyses of the defensive tergal gland secretions showed that P. cognata has replaced the aggression inducing undecane by the behaviorally neutral tridecane. P. funesta repels the ants by releasing the panic alarm pheromone sulcatone from its tergal gland resulting in an 'ant free space' around the beetles. Finally, Pella laticollis uses a specific and unique appeasing behavior. Behavioral and chemical data did not reveal any indication for the mimicry of the ants' cuticular hydrocarbon profiles by any of the beetle species. It is discussed that the employed strategies correlate with the ecological niches of the beetles. P. cognata and P. funesta are living along ant trails with ample space to escape and the employed strategies are probably sufficient to escape from dangerous conflicts. In contrast, P. laticollis lives in refuse areas of ant nests with frequent ant encounters, and its appeasement strategy allows it to stay at the encounter site.",

    "abstract": "Documentation of myrmecophily in Lycaenidae butterflies of the Western Ghats in Kerala state, Peninsular India is attempted. Of the 94 lycaenid species hitherto recorded to occur in Kerala, we reared 67 species. Based on larval rearing and literature review, we found that 55.3% of lycaenids in the state were myrmecophilous, 19.1% were myrmecoxenous, and 25.5% were data deficient. Eight species of lycaenids, previously unrecorded as myrmecophilous, were confirmed to be myrmecophilous, and seven species of ants were newly detected to be lycaenophilous. Twenty-two interactions had a hitherto unrecorded ant genus, and 42 involved an unreported ant species. A little less than one-fifth of the studied unique interactions were obligatory. Obligatory interaction was highest in the lycaenid Cigaritis Donzel, 1847, followed by Anthene Doubleday, 1847, Arhopala Boisduval, 1832, Catapaecilma Butler, 1879, and Zesius H\u00b8bner, 1819. Amongst butterflies, the highest number of ant associations was observed for Jamides celeno celeno (Cramer, [1775]) and Thaduka multicaudata kanara Evans, 1925. Native ants dominated the interactions (77.1% vs. 22.9%). Amongst the ants, Crematogaster Lund, 1831, dominated the unique interactions followed by Anoplolepis Santschi, 1914 and Camponotus Mayr, 1861.

    "abstract": "*[It has been noted that certain types of ant colonies are more open to invasion by myrmecophiles than others.  Characteristics of host colonies that are most open to invasion by myrmecophiles include: colonies with multiple queens (polygynous colonies), colonies with multiple nest sites (polydomous colonies, which are often also polygynous), & very large colonies.  These societies tend to be more 'loose, flexible, & dynamic' than monogynous colonies & tend to have less social cohesion leading to increased vulnerability to invasion by myrmecophiles.  In general, myrmecophile populations tend to occur in one of the following distinct patterns. First, a myrmecophilic species is found in many colonies at certain locations throughout a host species' range, but not at other locations (i.e., high infestation but low transmission).  Second, a myrmecophilic species is found throughout the host's range, but only within a few colonies at any given locality (i.e., low infestation, but high transmission).  Third, the myrmecophile is found in only a few colonies at any one locality & not throughout the host's range (i.e., low infestation & low transmission).  Once integrated into colonies, spider myrmecophiles certainly have evolved dramatic host-specific adaptations allowing them to become even more integrated into various aspects of the host's life cycle.  These adaptations, in turn, place severe constraints on the geographical distribution of these inquilines or ant guests; these symbionts are restricted to the range of that host species.  This may explain why such inquilines are very localized or rare & may be subject to frequent extinctions.  Adaptations common to myrmecophiles include evasive devices (behaviors, morphological structures, chemical signals used to appease hosts or to mimic hosts), protective morphological structures (sclerotized cuticular 'shields', plates), & communication mechanisms (chemical cues, tactile cues, auditory cues).]          *[Atelura formicaria misspelled Atelura formicarra; Dinarda dentata misspelled Dentarda dontata; Dinarda hagensii misspelled Dentarda hagens; Dinarda maerkelii misspelled Dentarda maerkeli; Dinarda pygmaea misspelled Dentarda pygmaea; Formica polyctena misspelled Formica polystena; Myrmecaphodius excavaticollis misspelled Myrmecaphobius excavaticollis; Teleutomyrmex schneideri misspelled Telectomyrex schneideri.]",

Army ants (Formicidae: Dorylinae) and their hundreds of closely associated insect guest species (myrmecophiles) can provide unique insights into interspecific microbial symbiont sharing. Here, we compared the microbiota of workers and larvae of the army ant Eciton burchellii with those of 13 myrmecophile beetle species using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We found that the previously characterized specialized bacterial symbionts of army ant workers were largely absent from ant larvae and myrmecophiles, whose microbial communities were usually dominated by Rickettsia, Wolbachia, Rickettsiella and/or Weissella. Strikingly, different species of myrmecophiles and ant larvae often shared identical 16S rRNA genotypes of these common bacteria. Protein\u0010coding gene sequences confirmed the close relationship of Weissella strains colonizing army ant larvae, some workers and several myrmecophile species.

    "abstract": "A variety of arthropods, particularly insects, have developed myrmecophilous interactions with ants to gain access to resources and/or for protection. Among these myrmecophiles, only a few examples have been documented in the Coccinellidae, most of them involving species able to feed on ant-tended Hemiptera. We report here a new case of obligate myrmecophily in the coccinellid Diomus thoracicus. Larvae are invariably and exclusively found in the nests of the ant Wasmannia auropunctata and seem to rely on ant brood as their only food source. Not only do ant workers show no aggressiveness toward the D. thoracicus larvae in their behavioral interactions at the colonial level, but also at the species level; while coccinellid adults are always attacked. The integration of the larvae inside of the ant nests is based on their chemical mimicry of the host's cuticular cues. Therefore, given the presence of the D. thoracicus larvae inside of the ant's nest, their predation on Wasmannia brood and their chemical mimicry, this species can be considered a specific parasite of W. auropunctata. Overall, this new case of myrmecophily not only specifically involves a highly invasive ant species, but also provides insights into the evolution of myrmecophily and myrmecophagy in coccinellids.          *[All D. thoracicus larvae were only found inside of W. auropunctata nests.  The nests of other sympatric ant species (i.e., Brachymyrmex sp., Crematogaster spp., Paratrechina sp., Pheidole sp., Solenopsis spp.) were also inspected & never showed the presence of D. thoracicus larvae.]",

    "abstract": "Tropical rainforests are among the most diverse biomes on Earth. While species inventories are far from complete for any tropical rainforest, even less is known about the intricate species interactions that form the basis of these ecological communities. One fascinating but poorly studied example are the symbiotic associations between army ants and their rich assemblages of parasitic arthropod guests. Hundreds of these guests, or myrmecophiles, have been taxonomically described. However, because previous work has mainly been based on haphazard collections from disjunct populations, it remains challenging to define species boundaries. We therefore know little about the species richness, abundance and host specificity of most guests in any given population, which is crucial to understand co-evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here, we report a quantitative community survey of myrmecophiles parasitizing the six sympatric Eciton army ant species in a Costa Rican rainforest. Combining DNA barcoding with morphological identification of over 2,000 specimens, we discovered 62 species, including 49 beetles, 11 flies, one millipede and one silverfish. At least 14 of these species were new to science. Ecological network analysis revealed a clear signal of host partitioning, and each Eciton species was host to both specialists and generalists. These varying degrees in host specificities translated into a moderate level of network specificity, highlighting the system's level of biotic pluralism in terms of biodiversity and interaction diversity. By providing vouchered DNA barcodes for army ant guest species, this study provides a baseline for future work on co-evolutionary and ecological dynamics in these species-rich host-ymbiont networks across the Neotropical realm.  This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time and is therefore in the public domain.",

    "abstract": "Numerous animals have evolved effective mechanisms to integrate into and exploit ant societies. Chemical integration strategies are particularly widespread among ant symbionts (myrmecophiles), probably because social insect nestmate recognition is predominantly mediated by cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). The importance of an accurate chemical mimicry of host CHCs for social acceptance recently has been demonstrated in a myrmecophilous silverfish. In the present study, we investigated the role of chemical mimicry in the myrmecophilous spider Gamasomorpha maschwitzi that co-occurs in the same host, Leptogenys distinguenda, as the silverfish. To test whether spiders acquire mimetic CHCs from their host or not, we transferred a stable isotope-labeled hydrocarbon to the cuticle of workers and analyzed the adoption of this label by the spiders. We also isolated spiders from hosts in order to study whether this affects: 1) their chemical host resemblance, and 2) their social integration. If spiders acquired host CHCs, rather than biosynthesizing them, they would be expected to lose these compounds during isolation. Spiders acquired the labeled CHC from their host, suggesting that they also acquire mimetic CHCs, most likely through physical contact. Furthermore, isolated spiders lost considerable quantities of their CHCs, indicating that they do not biosynthesize them. However, spiders remained socially well integrated despite significantly reduced chemical host similarity. We conclude that G. maschwitzi depends less on chemical mimicry to avoid recognition and aggressive rejection than the silverfish previously studied, suggesting that the two myrmecophiles possess different adaptations to achieve social integration.",

    "abstract": "*[A study was made of the ecology of 8 North American species of dacetine ants, including Strumigenys louisianae, Trichoscapa membranifera, & 6 native Smithistruma.  Food habits were emphasized.  The main dietary staples of these ants are entomobryoid & symphypleonan Collembola.  Poduroid Collembola are consistently rejected.  Strumigenys & Trichoscapa show the greatest latitude in food preferences, accepting occasionally Symphyla, Thysanura, termites, & mites.  Smithistruma clypeata, Sm. dietrichi, & Sm. talpa may also take Symphyla & Thysanura, but less readily.  The hunting behavior of these dacetines is described in  detail. All rely on stealth & actively stalk their prey, using their paired labral lobes as tactile organs, & seizing the prey with a convulsive snap of their mandibles.  No evidence of a toxic spray as suggested by Creighton (1937) was found.  The bizarre cephalic hairs may mimic parts of fungi, as Brown (1950) has speculated, but they cannot serve as visual lures & probably do not serve as lures of any kind, but rather may be used to deceive Collembola being stalked by the ants.  Notes on life histories, nesting habits, & myrmecophiles are given.  There is some evidence that colonies are founded in a partially claustral manner & that the queens hunt Collembola for their first brood.  The high degree of sympatry of ecologically uniform species in the Dacetini is emphasized.  It is suggested that this may be partly a result of unusually low population densities.]          *[Monomorium & Solenopsis larvae accepted as prey by some of the Dacetini studied.]",

We compare the social integration strategies of two myrmecophilic species, the spider, Gamasomorpha maschwitzi, and the newly described silverfish, Malayatelura ponerophila gen. n. sp. n., into colonies of the ponerine army ant, Leptogenys distinguenda (Emery) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Both symbionts use chemical mimicry through adoption of host cuticular hydrocarbons. Exchange experiments between L. distinguenda and an undetermined Leptogenys species demonstrate that reduced aggression toward alien ants and increased social acceptance occurred with individuals of higher chemical similarity in their cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. We found striking differences in chemical and behavioral strategies between the two myrmecophiles. Spider cuticular hydrocarbon profiles were chemically less similar to the host than silverfish profiles were. Nevertheless, spiders received significantly fewer attacks from host ants and survived longer in laboratory colonies, whereas silverfish were treated with high aggression and were killed more frequently. When discovered and confronted by the host, silverfish tended to escape and were chased aggressively, whereas spiders remained in contact with the confronting host ant until aggression ceased. Thus, spiders relied less on chemical mimicry but were nevertheless accepted more frequently by the host on the basis of behavioral mechanisms. These findings give insights into the fine tuning of social integration mechanisms and show the significance of qualitative differences among strategies.",

Our study focused on behavioral & on chemical integration & exploitation strategies of the different symbiont species.  In addition, we examined potential counterstrategies of the host ant.  Myrmecophiles were studied both in large free-living L. distinguenda colonies & in more detail in parts of colonies separated for observation.  We found that at least 5 myrmecophile species imposed cost on their host by exploiting its resources.  Their impact varied considerably depending on both the type of resources exploited & their abundance.  Myrmecophile species were well integrated into host societies either by chemical mimicry of host cuticular hydrocarbons or by remaining chemically insignificant, lacking most characteristic recognition cues.  Despite these chemical integration strategies, host ants were able to recognize & kill the alien intruders to various degrees.  This important finding demonstrates that symbiont populations are actively counter-regulated by the host.  By constructing a host-parasite interaction network, we finally suggest that host defences can maintain myrmecophile diversity by keeping parasite populations small.]",

    "abstract": "*[A new hypothesis explaining the adaptive significance of bright autumn leaf colors argues that these colors signal tree quality to myrmecophilous specialist aphids.  In turn, the aphids attract aphid-tending ants during the following spring, which defend the trees from other aphids & herbivores.  In this context, other types of plant coloration, such as the color change observed in young & old spring leaves, may function as a signal of plant quality for aphids & other myrmecophilous hemipterans.  If these plant colors are costly for plants, then vividly colorful plants would be required to invest more in growth than in defense; as a result, colorful plants may be more palatable for honeydew-producing hemipterans, such as aphids, scale insects, & treehoppers, although the relative importance of hemipterans other than aphids may be relatively low.  These hemipterans may be attracted to colorful plants, after which their attendant ants would protect the plants from herbivory.]",

    "abstract": "Various aspects of the biology of the myrmecophilous Thiasophila angulata and T. szujeckii (Staphylinidae; Aleocharinae), mainly associated with the Formica rufa species group, are studied. The composition of defensive gland secretions from adults of T. angulata has been analysed. The complete development (egg-L1-3-pupa-adult form), including adult overwintering, of both species takes place solely in ant nests. Under laboratory conditions, this lasts for about 22 days in T. angulata, and the period elapsing between the old and new generations of insects is approximately two months. The mean fecundity of adults of this species (28 eggs) was determined, as well as the duration of its reproductive period (mean 28.5 days), and lifespan (mean 67 days). In natural conditions T. angulata, found within nests of Formica polyctena and F. rufa, produces three generations, and the sibling species T. szujeckii one generation per year. These two species differ in their phenologies and abundance dynamics of adults and larvae, which is linked to the size and temperature regime of the host nest. The results of this study uphold the recent separation of T. angulata and T. szujeckii based on morphological features of adults and selected molecular markers. Adults and larvae of T. angulata forage on both live and dead food items accumulated by the host, as well as on the host's eggs and larvae. Both the beetle larvae and adults remain unmolested among the host workers. The adults use their defensive gland secretions, which contains substantial quantities of toxic quinones, when necessary. According to the current categories of myrmecophiles, T. angulata (and by analogy, T. szujeckii as well) should be classified as a species wholly integrated with the host.",

    "abstract": "In model anthill complexes of the Verkhnyaya Klyaz'ma Myrmecological Reserve, Moscow oblast, the composition and distribution patterns of beetles (Coleoptera) living inside the colonies of F. aquilonia were monitored in 2004-2009. Altogether, 1822 beetle specimens were collected, belonging to 75 species and 16 families. The most abundant were Ptiliidae (994 inds.) and Staphylinidae (504 inds.). In terms of species richness, Staphylinidae was the leading family: 43 species (57%). Among the myrmecophiles proper, 17 species belonged to Staphylinidae and 15 to other Coleoptera families. The patterns of Coleoptera populations in the nests depend on the condition of the anthill, the topographic position (floodplain, river terrace, slope), and the composition of the nest material. The faunistic similarity of Coleoptera appears to be higher in anthill groups interconnected through individual ant exchanges or retaining kinship after migratory processes in the recent past.",

Promyrmister kistneri gen. et sp.nov. belongs to the haeteriine clown beetles (Coleoptera: Histeridae), a major clade of 'myrmecophiles' (specialized nest intruders with dramatic anatomical, chemical, & behavioral adaptations for colony infiltration).  Promyrmister reveals that myrmecophiles evolved close to the emergence of ant eusociality, in colonies of stem-group ants that predominate Burmese amber, or with cryptic crown-group ants that remain largely unknown at this time.  The clown beetle-ant relationship has been maintained ever since by the beetles host-switching to numerous modern ant genera, ultimately diversifying into one of the largest radiations of symbiotic animals.  We infer that obligate behavioral symbioses can evolve relatively rapidly, & be sustained over deep time.]",
