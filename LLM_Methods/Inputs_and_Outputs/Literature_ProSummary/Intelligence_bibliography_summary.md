Here, algorithms based on the behavior of social insects are applied to a consumer decision model designed to guide new product decisions, & to allow planning & evaluation of product offering scenarios.  Ant colony optimization heuristics are efficient at searching through a vast decision space & are extremely flexible when model inputs continuously change.  When compared to complete enumeration of all possible solutions, ant colony optimization is found to generate near-optimal results for this problem.  Prior research has focused primarily on optimal product planning using consumer preference data from a single point in time.  Extant literature suggests these formulations are overly simplistic, as a consumer's level of preference for a product is affected by past experience & prior choices.  This application models consumer preferences as evolutionary, shifting over time.]",

    "abstract": "Insect colours assist in body protection, signalling, and physiological adaptations. Colours also convey multiple channels of information. These channels are valuable for species identification, distinguishing individual quality, and revealing ecological or evolutionary aspects of animals\u0019 life. During recent years, the emerging interest in colour research has been raised in social hymenopterans such as ants, wasps, and bees. These insects provide important ecosystem services and many of those are model research organisms. Here we review benefits that various colour types give to social insects, summarize practical applications, and highlight further directions. Ants might use colours principally for camouflage, however the evolutionary function of colour in ants needs more attention; in case of melanin colouration there is evidence for its interrelation with thermoregulation and pathogen resistance. Colours in wasps and bees have confirmed linkages to thermoregulation, which is increasingly important in face of global climate change. Besides wasps use colours for various types of signalling. Colour variations of well chemically defended social insects are the mimetic model for unprotected organisms. Despite recent progress in molecular identification of species, colour variations are still widely in use for species identification. Therefore, further studies on variability is encouraged. Being closely interconnected with physiological and biochemical processes, insect colouration is a great source for finding new ecological indicators and biomarkers. Due to novel digital imaging techniques, software, and artificial intelligence there are emerging possibilities for new advances in this topic. Further colour research in social insects should consider specific features of sociality.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting summer monsoon rainfall with precision becomes crucial for the farmers to plan for harvesting in a country like India where the national economy is mostly based on regional agriculture. The forecast of monsoon rainfall based on artificial neural network is a well-researched problem. In the present study, the meta-heuristic ant colony optimization (ACO) technique is implemented to forecast the amount of summer monsoon rainfall for the next day over Kolkata (22.6-degrees N, 88.4-degrees E), India. The ACO technique belongs to swarm intelligence and simulates the decision-making processes of ant colony similar to other adaptive learning techniques. ACO technique takes inspiration from the foraging behavior of some ant species. The ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark a favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. A range of rainfall amount replicating the pheromone concentration is evaluated during the summer monsoon season. The maximum amount of rainfall during summer monsoon season (June-September) is observed to be within the range of 7.5-35 mm during the period from 1998 to 2007, which is in the range 4 category set by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The result reveals that the accuracy in forecasting the amount of rainfall for the next day during the summer monsoon season using ACO technique is 95% where as the forecast accuracy is 83% with Markov chain model (MCM). The forecast through ACO and MCM are compared with other existing models and validated with IMD observations from 2008 to 2012.",

ML is a novel black box method that does not consider functional links between species and their environment. Its prediction accuracy is limited only by the quality and quantity of species records data. ML modelling is applied to calculate the global distribution of ant species richness and achieves 71.78% (decision tree), 70.62% (random forest), 71.09% (logistic regression), and 75.18% (neural network) testing accuracy. The results show that in some West African countries, the species predicted by ML are 1.99 times as many as the species currently recorded. These West African countries have many ant species but lack observational data, and policymakers may be overlooking areas that require protection.",

Social insects such as ants show wide variation in worker body size & morphology that correlates with brain size, structure, & worker task performance, which is dependent on sensory inputs and information-processing ability to generate behavior.  Elevated production & maintenance costs in workers may impose energetic constraints on body size & brain size that are reflected in patterns of metabolic scaling.

Systems of nonlinear positive feedback, such as quorum responses, are thought to be integral to consensus decision processes that seek to optimize decision speed and accuracy while maintaining group cohesion, requirements typical of the house-hunting process in social insects. Studies of nest site selection in honeybees, Apis mellifera, and Temnothorax ants have revealed strong similarities in the manner in which consensus decisions are achieved, and imply a central role for quorum responses, but treatments of other species are scarce. I investigated the process of consensus decision making during colony relocation in the small colony ant Myrmecina nipponica. Colonies of individually marked ants were forced to relocate in experimental laboratory arenas, and given a choice of one or two alternative new sites. This species differs from other well-studied systems in using pheromone trails to navigate between old and new sites, and does not use obvious means of recruitment such as tandem running or adult transport. A quorum threshold apparently governed the switch to brood transport, which marked the final phase of the relocation. Furthermore, there was a strong relationship between inferred quorum threshold and colony size. A demonstration of the use of a quorum rule in M. nipponica would underline the central role of quorum responses in consensus decision making, despite interspecific variation in colony size and differing modes of recruitment and navigation.",

    "abstract": "Pooling information can allow groups to make better decisions than individuals, an idea that underlies the use of groups to make important decisions in human society. Group size is also thought to influence the accuracy of decision making in nonhuman animals, but despite the enormous variation in the size and composition of animal societies, very few studies have explored this question outside of humans. Furthermore, although both humans and animals need to make decisions in dynamic environments and models suggest that environmental conditions can alter or even invert the advantage of group size, no empirical study has addressed how the advantage of group size may vary with environmental context. In this study I investigated how group size and environmental context influence decision making using an ant model system in which colonies use a quorum-based process to decide collectively among new nesting sites. Decision making unfolded in a similar manner in colonies of different size, as quorum thresholds and task allocation scaled with colony size. Larger colonies, however, made more accurate decisions than small colonies, and in most cases did so more rapidly. There was also an influence of environmental conditions, as whereas the decision accuracy of small groups was comparable to that of large groups in benign conditions, decision making was largely ineffective in small colonies in more challenging conditions. Colonies adapted to different environmental conditions by adjusting quorum thresholds, shifting thresholds down to emphasize speed when under stress and showing a pattern of higher thresholds in complex environments. The advantage to larger colonies probably stems from their greater information collecting and processing ability, which also serves to buffer them from the negative influences of more challenging environments.",

    "abstract": "Animals may face a tradeoff between enhanced cognitive ability and the cost of maintaining larger and more energetically expensive brains. In social species, this tradeoff could be influenced by energy-reducing benefits of cooperation and collective cognition. Greater social complexity in ants is hypothesized to be associated with smaller brain size, a pattern opposite that found in some social vertebrates. Ants vary in worker and colony size, and worker size-frequency distributions; larger workers have larger, more costly, brains. Colony-level foraging performance and its energetic consequence to fitness depend on individual cognitive capabilities as well as collective behaviors. To explore the impact of diet, behavioral ability, and social organization on brain evolution, we developed a model incorporating food availability, foraging behavior and related energetic gain, colony size, worker size and polymorphism, and brain size. Colonies could increase energy intake through foraging performance by increasing worker size, and by correlation, brain size and expanded task capability, or by increasing colony size and collective foraging. Results show that resource-poor environments favored small colonies of relatively large-bodied and thus large-brained pluripotent workers that had higher energetic costs. In contrast, large colonies of relatively small-bodied and small-brained workers in resource-rich environments harvested food with lower brain investment and hence decreased metabolic costs. Worker size-related behavioral specialization and covarying brain investment also influenced fitness. The energetic advantage of polymorphism depended on the degree of association of the navigational abilities employed during foraging and worker brain size. Our study suggests that diet, colony size, and worker size may influence tradeoffs between individual and collective cognition and the evolution of brain size and division of labor in eusocial insects such as ants.",

We present a first mathematical model devoted to brood sorting.  Our hypothesis about ants behavior are consciously minimal.  We assume that random rules their acts, not only when they walk, but also when they choose a brood item that they pick up, or beside which they deposit the one they carry.  The first part of our work deals with the process of aggregation in a single cluster.  The main subject of our study is the time evolution of a mathematical function linked to the notion of cluster.  We prove that, whatever the number of ants acting, this function tends to decrease until it reaches a threshold that we compute: this threshold matches with the formation of the single cluster.  The second part of our work deals with segregation in concentric annuli.  Coupling the concept of virtual size of a brood item to the previous conclusions leads to a realistic explanation of the concentric structure observed in ant colonies. Finally, we prove the existence of a feed-back effect, so that our results suggest that brood sorting is a case of self-organization that does not involve swarm-intelligence.]",

    "abstract": "*[Collective intelligence allows groups of individuals to solve problems which otherwise could not be solved by a single individual.  Insect workers have tiny brains, but by functioning as part of a self-organized colony, they find sophisticated solutions to vital organizational problems (e.g., finding a suitable new home or exploiting the best food sources in a changing environment).  In consensus decision making, unanimity among workers is crucial.  In contrast, combined decision making requires that different groups of workers within the colony chose different options.  Communication & learning are often fundamental in collective decision making.  However, as workers gain experience, communication may lose importance as an information source for workers.]",

Monomorium pharaonis exploit the geometry of trail networks bifurcations to make U-turns, when walking the wrong way.  However, 7% of foragers perform apparently incorrect U-turns.  These seemingly maladaptive  U-turns are performed by a consistent minority of specialist U-turners that make frequent U-turns on trails & lay trail pheromones with high frequency.  Our study shows a key role for U-turning ants in maintaining the connectivity of pheromone trails.  We produced an agent-based model of a heterogeneous ant community where 7% of agents were specialized frequent U-turners whilst the remaining 93% rarely U-turned.  Simulations showed that heterogeneous colonies enjoyed significantly greater success at foraging for distant food resources compared to behaviorally homogeneous colonies.  The presence of a cohort of specialized trail-layers maintains a well-connected network of trails which ensures that food discoveries are rapidly linked back to the nest.]",

    "abstract": "*[All termites secrete trail pheromones from their sternal gland, whereas ants use a variety of glands for this purpose.  This & the diversity of chemical compounds that serve as trail pheromones among ants, & the uniformity of chemicals among termite trails, suggest a different evolutionary historical dynamics for the development of chemical mass recruitment in both taxa.  Termites in addition show pheromonal parsimony.  This suggest a single evolutionary origin of pheromone trails in Isoptera, whereas chemical mass recruitment among Formicidae seems to have evolved many times & in different ways.  Despite these very different evolutionary histories, both taxa evolved chemical recruitment systems involving attractants & orientation signals, & at least 2 divergent decision making system for recruitment.  This evolutionary analogy suggests that chemical mass recruitment is constraint by fundamental physical dynamic laws.  Artificial intelligence including 'mass intelligence' & 'ant intelligence', emulates mass recruitment in interacting virtual agents in search of optimal solutions.  This approach, however, has copied only the 'Democratic' recruitment dynamics with a single compound pheromone.  Ant & termite evolution shows more sophisticated recruitment dynamics which, if understood properly, will improve our understanding of nature and applications of artificial 'swarm intelligence'.]",

    "abstract": "Chemical communication among social insects is often studied with chromatographic methods. The data generated in such studies may be complex and require pattern recognition techniques for interpretation. Presently, we are analyzing gas chromatographic (GC) profiles of hydrocarbon extracts obtained from the cuticle and postpharyngeal gland (PPG) of 400 Cataglyphis niger ants using a genetic algorithm (GA) for pattern recognition analysis to identify the factors influencing colony odor. The pattern recognition GA identifies features (i.e., chromatographic peaks) whose principal component plots show clustering of the samples on the basis of class. Because the largest principal components capture the bulk of the variance in the data, the peaks chosen by the GA primarily convey information about differences between the classes in a data set. As it trains, the pattern recognition GA focuses on those classes and/or samples that are difficult to classify by boosting their class and sample weights. Samples or classes that consistently classify correctly are not as heavily weighted as samples or classes that are difficult to classify. Over time, the algorithm learns its parameters in a manner similar to a neural network. The proposed algorithm integrates aspects of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computations to yield a 'smart' one-pass procedure for feature selection and pattern recognition. Utilizing the pattern recognition GA, two specific questions were addressed in this study: (1) Does the overall hydrocarbon profile of the colony change with time? (2) Does the queen influence the hydrocarbon pattern of the colony?   (This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employee(s) on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.)",

    "abstract": "The study of the foraging behavior of group animals (especially ants) is of practical ecological importance, but it also contributes to the development of widely applicable optimization problem-solving techniques. Biologists have discovered that single ants exhibit low-dimensional deterministic-chaotic activities. However, the influences of the nest, ants\u0019 physical abilities, and ants\u0019 knowledge (or experience) on foraging behavior have received relatively little attention in studies of the collective behavior of ants. This paper provides new insights into basic mechanisms of effective foraging for social insects or group animals that have a home. We propose that the whole foraging process of ants is controlled by three successive strategies: hunting, homing, and path building. A mathematical model is developed to study this complex scheme. We show that the transition from chaotic to periodic regimes observed in our model results from an optimization scheme for group animals with a home. According to our investigation, the behavior of such insects is not represented by random but rather deterministic walks (as generated by deterministic dynamical systems, e.g., by maps) in a random environment: the animals use their intelligence and experience to guide them. The more knowledge an ant has, the higher its foraging efficiency is. When young insects join the collective to forage with old and middle-aged ants, it benefits the whole colony in the long run. The resulting strategy can even be optimal.",

While observing a colony of Camponotus japonicus, we discovered that workers frequently dumped protein-rich food items at a particular spot, while other workers collected the dumped food items and brought them back to the nest. These two counteractive processes were performed simultaneously by the same colony, which indicates possible inefficiency of their collective labor. Discarding a specific type of food to calibrate the nutritional balance of a colony has been previously reported, but we found no reports on re-collecting discarded food. We suspect that this phenomenon might have been an outcome of communication inefficiency within the colony, or that the putative dump site might have served as a temporary deposit of food items before they were redistributed inside the nest.",

    "abstract": "Interest in protecting ecological areas is increasing because of land uses conflicts and environmental pressures. The optimal zoning of protected ecological areas belongs to a NP-hard problem because it is subject to both box and spatial constraints. A challenge in solving area optimization problems emerges with the increasing size of a study region. In this article, an integrated approach of remote sensing, GIS and modified ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed for application in zoning protected ecological areas. Significant modifications have been made in the conventional ACO so that it can be further extended to solve zoning problems in large regions. An improved selection strategy is designed to accelerate the progress of sites selection for artificial ants. Another important modification in ACO is to incorporate the neighborhood diffusion strategy into pheromone updating. The optimal objective is to generate protected areas that maximize both ecological suitability and spatial compactness. The modified ACO model has been successfully applied to a case study involving an area of 25,483 cells in Dongguan, Guangdong, China. The experiments have demonstrated that the proposed model is an efficient and effective optimization technique for generating optimal protection. The modified ACO model only requires approximately 119 s for determining near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, the proposed method performs better than other methods, including simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, iterative relaxation, basic ACO, and density slicing.          *[No specific ant species mentioned.]",

In cooperative transport, ants work together to move a large object back to their nest.  We blocked cooperative transport groups of Paratrechina longicornis with obstacles of varying complexity, analyzing group' trajectories to infer what kind of strategy the ants employed.  Simple strategies require little information, but more challenging, robust strategies succeed with a wider range of obstacles.  We found that transport groups use a stochastic strategy that leads to efficient navigation around simple obstacles, & still succeeds at difficult obstacles.  While groups navigating obstacles preferentially move directly toward the nest, they change their behavior over time; the longer the ants are obstructed, the more likely they are to move away from the nest, which increases the chance of finding a path around the obstacle. Groups rapidly changed directions & rarely stalled during navigation, indicating that these ants maintain consensus even when the nest direction is blocked.  Although some decisions were aided by the arrival of new ants, at many key points, direction changes were initiated within the group, with no apparent external cause.]",

The final position of the structure depended on the intensity of the traffic & the extent of path deviation & was influenced by a cost-benefit trade-off at the colony level, where the benefit of increased foraging trail efficiency was balanced by the cost of removing workers from the foraging pool to form the structure.  To examine this trade-off, we quantified the geometric relationship between costs & benefits revealed by our experiments.  We then constructed a model to determine the bridge location that maximized foraging rate, which qualitatively matched the observed movement of bridges.

The main idea of the information theory approach is that experimenters 'ask' ants to transfer to each other a specific amount of information in order to obtain food.  In the experiments, I describe, the information to be transferred by ants concerns a sequence of turns in the maze 'binary tree' in one series of experiments, & the number of a branch in comb-like 'counting mazes' in the other series.  This method first of all reveals distant homing in ants, that is, their ability to transfer information about remote events.  Firstly, it was experimentally demonstrated that in red wood ants & in Formica sanguinea Latreille, 1798, distant homing is based on a scout-foragers recruitment system: ants work in constant teams, & a scout shares the information on the discovered food only with members of its team.  Then, important characteristics of the ants' communication & cognition were evaluated, such as the rate of information transmission, & the potential flexibility of communication systems.

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue of collective intelligence is whether the collective pattern or process is based on environmental information that explicitly codes for it or arises through self-organization of the individuals. Sometimes, these alternatives occur together. Adaptive systems may also be capable of utilizing different types of mechanism under different conditions. Sendova-Franks et al. (Anim Behav 68:1095-1106, 2004) demonstrated evidence for a self-organization mechanism of brood sorting in the ant Temnothorax albipennis, where the brood are sorted in a series of bands or concentric annuli that increase in size with distance from the colony centre. The work by Cox and Blanchard (J Theor Biol 204:223-238, 2000) suggests an alternative or complementary mechanism whereby the brood pattern is specified by the template of a CO2 gradient. Here, we test for a gaseous template as a necessary condition for brood sorting. Under the experimental condition, we pumped the air out of the nest continuously to prevent the accumulation of any gaseous substances. We compared the brood pattern between the experimental and control conditions according to four characteristics: mean distance from centre, mean nearest-neighbour distance, shape and area. Under the experimental condition, the order of brood types according to the first two characteristics was the same as in the control. The area of the brood pattern was smaller, and its shape elongated under the experimental condition. As expected on the basis of these differences, mean distance from centre was greater and mean nearest-neighbour distance was smaller under the experimental condition (although not statistically significantly) and by the expected amount. We found evidence that ants avoid placing brood in the strongest airflow stream. This could explain the reduced area and elongated shape of the brood pattern under the experimental condition. We conclude that a gaseous template is not a necessary condition for brood sorting.",

While the connection between animal aggregations & the physics of non-living materials has been proposed since the early 1900s, the recent advent of physics of behavior studies provides new insights into social interactions governed by physical principles.

    "abstract": "Understanding the link between ecology and morphology is a fundamental goal in biology. Ants are diverse terrestrial organisms, known to exhibit ecologically driven morphological variation. While relationships between individual traits and ecologies have been identified, multidimensional interactions among traits and their cumulative predictive power remain unknown. As selective pressures may generate convergent syndromes spanning multiple traits, we applied multivariate analyses across a wide sampling of taxa to assess ecomorphological variation in an integrative context. How well does morphology predict ecology? Moreover, are there quantitatively supported ant ecomorphs? We investigated the links between trait morphology and ecology by assembling a morphometric dataset spanning over 160 species within 110 genera. As ants occupy a wide range of ecologies, we compiled natural history data on nesting microhabitat, foraging stratum and functional role into 35 defined niche combinations. This tripartite ecological classification and our morphological dataset were optimized under dimension reduction techniques including principal component analysis, principal coordinate analysis, linear discriminant analysis and random forest supervised machine learning. Our results describe ant ecomorphospace as comprising regions of shared, generalized morphology as well as unique phenotypic space associated with specialized ecologies. Dimension reduction and model\u0010based approaches predict ecology with 77%-85% accuracy and Random Forest analysis consistently outperforms LDA. While accounting for shared ancestry, we found eye, antennal scape and leg morphology to be most informative in differentiating among ecologies. We also note some heterogeneity between trait significance in each ecological aspect (nesting niche, foraging niche, functional role). To increase the utility of ecomorphological classification we simplified our 35 observed niche combinations into 10 ecomorph syndromes, which were also predicted by morphology. The predictive power of these machine learning methods underscores the strong role that ecology has in convergently shaping overall body plan morphology across ant lineages.

The modulatory pheromone triggers aversion towards low-quality nests & enhances colony cohesion in summer and autumn, but not after overwintering (in agreement with reports that field colonies split in spring & reunite in summer).  Interestingly, we show that the pheromone acts by downgrading the perceived value of marked nests by informed & naive individuals.  This contrasts with theories of collective intelligence, stating that accurate collective decision-making requires independent evaluation of options by individuals.  The violation of independence highlighted here was accordingly shown to increase error rate during emigrations.  This is counterbalanced by enhanced cohesion & the transmission of valuable information through the colony.]",

After food relocation, the pheromone must evaporate sufficiently before foraging can shift colony attention to a new food source.  The amount of food consumed with in the dynamic environment depends non-monotonically on the pheromone evaporation time constant-with maximal consumption occurring at a time constant which balances trail formation & trail flexibility.  A deterministic, 'mean field' model of pheromone & foragers on trails mimics our colony simulations.

Diverse models describe how sociality may have influenced eusocial insect-brain evolution, but specific impacts of social organization and other selective forces on brain architecture have been difficult to distinguish. Here, we evaluate predictions derived from and/or inferences made by models of social organization concerning the effects of individual and collective behavior on brain size, structure, and function using results of neuroanatomical and genomic studies. In contrast to the predictions of some models, we find that worker brains in socially complex species have great behavioral and cognitive capacity. We also find that colony size, the evolution of worker physical castes, and task specialization affect brain size and mosaicism, supporting the idea that sensory, processing and motor requirements for behavioral performance select for adaptive allometries of functionally specialized brain centers. We review available transcriptomic and comparative genomic studies seeking to elucidate the molecular pathways functionally associated with social life and the genetic changes that occurred during the evolution of social complexity. We discuss ways forward, using comparative neuroanatomy, transcriptomics, and comparative genomics, to distinguish among multiple alternative explanations for the relationship between the evolution of neural systems and social complexity.",

In this study, we examined whether L. humile foraging routes minimize travel distance and maximize linearity (i.e., have the fewest turns). Colonies of L. humile foraged in an artificial grid containing a number of possible routes to a long-lasting food source. In the design, there were three possible shortest routes that varied only in the number of turns that the ants had to make. The majority of foraging ants preferred one of the three shortest routes to the food, and significantly favored the path with the fewest turns. Selection of the shortest, straightest route may maximize mass recruitment to the food source by decreasing the chance of foraging ants losing the trail.",
