    "abstract": "Maintaining and updating FORMIS requires the cooperative efforts of myrmecologists throughout the world.  >>Please begin by inspecting citations of your own work for accuracy and completeness<<.  The addition of keywords and/or abstracts would be especially useful.  Please see the next section for instructions about how to contribute or update citations.  AGRICOLA will be searched to keep FORMIS updated; however, this will only find a small portion of the literature.  It is hoped that this database will become a magnet and distribution mechanism for specialty ant bibliographies like the Fire Ant Literature Database.  Specialty bibliographies are needed for genera such as Formica, Camponotus, Myrmica, Pheidole, Monomorium, Messor and Cataglyphis to name a few.  Specialty bibliographies on subjects such as foraging, bioenergetics, myrmecophiles, and ant-plant symbioses would also be useful.  Geographic bibliographies for places like Hawaii, India, Mexico, Brazil, etc. could also be assembled.  Specialty bibliographies can range from a few dozen citations to several thousand; the only requirement is that they be thorough.  New citations could also be added by journal.  Please contact Dr. Porter if you are interested in adding a bibliography to FORMIS.  Users are welcome to create their own customized bibliographies from FORMIS; however, they should be aware that personal modifications to FORMIS will be lost in future updates if they are not sent in for official inclusion.  Also, users who use EndNote to automatically create bibliographies at the end of their papers should be aware that citation numbers in FORMIS will not be consistant from year to year, so a paper started on one database needs to be finished on the same one.",

The inner surface of the pitcher leaves had a black and green lining composed of intermingled coccoid cells and filaments of algae and fungi, reminiscent of a biofilm structure. Microscopic investigation of the algae suggested they belonged to Trebouxia (coccoid cells) and Trentepohliaceae (filaments). Molecular investigation of environmental samples and pure cultures of the fungi revealed five species of Chaetothyriales and four species of Capnodiales, among which two have already been isolated from ant-plant symbioses in Africa and South America and five were described species known from various environments around world. One appears to be an undescribed species. Thus, most fungal associates were likely ubiquitous species.

The phylogenetic distribution and geological ages of these associations, and the frequency of gains or losses of domatium, are largely unknown.  We compiled an up-to-date list of ant domatium-bearing plants, estimated their probable true number from model-based statistical inference, generated dated phylogenies that include c. 50% of ant-plant lineages, and traced the occurrence of domatia and extrafloral nectaries on a 1181-species tree, using likelihood and Bayesian methods.  We found 681 vascular plants with domatia (159 genera in 50 families) resulting from minimally 158 inferred domatium origins and 43 secondary losses over the last 19 Myr. The oldest African ant-plant symbioses are younger than those in Australasia and the Neotropics. The best statistical model suggests that the true number of myrmecophytes may approach 1140 species.  The phylogenetic distribution of ant-plants shows that domatia evolved from a range of pre-adapted morphological structures and have been lost frequently, suggesting that domatia have no generalizable effect on diversification. The Miocene origin of ant-plant symbioses is consistent with inferred changes in diet and behaviour during ant evolution.",

    "abstract": "A tabular survey of ant-plant symbioses worldwide summarizes aspects of the evolutionary ecology of these associations. Remarkable similarities between ant-plant symbioses in disjunct tropical regions result from convergent and parallel evolution of similarly preadapted ants and plants. Competition among ants has driven evolutionary specialization in plant-ants and is the principal factor accounting for parallelism and convergence. As habitat specialization accompanied the evolutionary radiation of many myrmecophytes, frequent host shifts and de novo colonizations by habitat-specific ants both inhibited species-specific coevolution and co-gladogenesis, and magnified the diversity of mutualistic partners. The comparatively high species diversity of neotropical plant-ants and myrmecophytes probably results from two historical factors. Most importantly, influenced by Andean orogeny, greater habitat disturbance by fluvial systems has created a mosaic of habitat types unparalleled in other tropical regions; both myrmecophytes and plant-ants have diversified across habitat boundaries. Second, the arrival of a new wave of dominant ants (especially Crematogaster) may have condensed the diversity of relatively timid plant-ants to a greater degree in Africa and Asia than in the more isolated Neotropics. Regular trajectories in the evolutionary histories of plant-ants appear to be driven principally by competition, in a manner analogous to the taxon cycles or pulses proposed for other groups.          *[with appendix: worldwide summary of all symbiontic ant-plant relationships known so far.

The Asian ant-plant association between Crematogaster ants and Macaranga plants is highly species specific and the molecular phylogeny of the ants parallels the plant phylogeny, reflecting history of cospeciation. Evidence is presented that this association has been maintained over the past seven million years.

MicroSPE was used to investigate leaf volatiles of 11 myrmecophytic and non-myrmecophytic Macaranga species. Chemical analysis (GC-MS) yielded a total of 114 compounds comprising a great diversity, including aliphatic compounds, aromatics, mono- and sesquiterpenoids. An analysis of the volatile data using the CNESS distances of the chemical profiles, followed by visualization of the data with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showed that even closely related species sharing the same ant partners have clearly different scent patterns. Comparison of spectra of volatile compounds between obligate myrmecophytic Macarena species and myrmecophilous species that are only facultatively associated with unspecific arboreal ants did not reveal general differences. Choice experiments conducted with foundresses revealed that the ants have the capacity to distinguish between different host species. However, the behavior of the foundresses following surface contact with saplings indicates that other cues, like surface structure, may play a more important role in host-recognition over short distances than volatile compounds. We discuss alternative hypotheses for the possible role of leaf volatiles in the examined Macaranga species as chemical defense against herbivores.",

Such interactions, including mycorrhizal symbioses and ant-plant associations, are widespread and play an important role at the ecosystem and community levels. In ant-plant mutualisms, the plants may benefit from both the protection provided by the presence of ants and from the nutrients absorbed from insect debris. However, the role of third partners in plant nutrition, particularly ant-associated fungi, has never before been demonstrated. 2.We investigate this issue in the ant-plant Hirtella physophora. In this model system, Allomerus decemarticulatus ants are involved in two, highly specific interactions: first, with their host plant, and, secondly, with a fungus that they actively manipulate. Moreover, the ants combine both plant trichomes and fungal hyphae to make a trap to capture prey. 3.We empirically demonstrate the existence of a third type of interaction between the fungus and the plant through the use of both experimental enrichments with stable isotopes (15N) and histological approaches. The fungus growing in the galleries plays a role in providing nutrients to the host plant, in addition to the structural role it plays for the ants. Fungus-facilitated nitrogen uptake occurs mainly in old domatia, where abundant hyphae are in close contact with the plant cells. Whether the fungi inside the domatia and those in the galleries are the same is still uncertain. 4.Synthesis.Together, our results show that a fungal partner in an ant-plant mutualism can benefit the plant by improving its nutrient uptake, and they demonstrate the existence of a true tripartite mutualism in this system. Our results add further evidence to the notion that interpretations of some ant-plant symbioses as purely protective mutualisms have overlooked these nutritional aspects.",

In return, the inhabiting ants protect plants against herbivores and sometimes provide them with nutrients. Here, we review recent advances in ant-plant symbioses, focusing on three areas. First, the nutritional ecology of plant-ants, which is based not only on plant-derived food rewards, but also on inputs from other symbiotic partners, in particular fungi and possibly bacteria. Food and protection are the most important 'currencies' exchanged between partners and they drive the nature and evolution of the relationships. Secondly, studies of conflict and cooperation in ant-plant symbioses have contributed key insights into the evolution and maintenance of mutualism, particularly how partner-mediated feedbacks affect the specificity and stability of mutualisms. There is little evidence that mutualistic ants or plants are under selection to cheat, but the costs and benefits of ant-plant interactions do vary with environmental factors, making them vulnerable to natural or anthropogenic environmental change. Thus, thirdly, ant-plant symbioses should be considered good models for investigating the effects of global change on the outcome of mutualistic interactions",

However, ants may provide additional services. In a review of published studies on ant-pathogen-plant interactions, we investigated whether ants\u0019 extensive hygiene measures, including the use of ant\u0010produced antibiotics, extend to their host plants and reduce plant pathogen loads. From 30 reported species combinations, we found that the presence of ants lead to reduced pathogen levels in 18 combinations and to increased levels in 6. On average, ants significantly reduced pathogen incidence with 59%. This effect size did not differ significantly from effect sizes reported from meta\u0010analyses on herbivore protection. Thus, pathogen and herbivore protection could be of equal importance in ant-plant mutualisms. Considering the abundance of these interactions, ecological impacts are potentially high. Furthermore, awareness of this service may stimulate the development of new measures to control plant diseases in agriculture. It should be noted, though, that studies were biased toward tropical ant-plant symbioses and that the literature in the field is limited at present. Future research on plant pathogens is needed to enhance our understanding of ant-plant mutualisms and their evolution.",

Obligate ant-plants, or myrmecophytes, provide a nesting place, and, often, food to a limited number of plant-ant species. In exchange, plant-ants protect their host plants from herbivores, competitors and pathogens, and can provide them with nutrients. Although most studies to date have highlighted a similar global pattern of interactions in these systems, little is known about the temporal structuring and dynamics of most of these associations. In this study we focused on the association between the understory myrmecophyte Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae) and its obligate ant partner Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae). An examination of the life histories and growth rates of both partners demonstrated that this plant species has a much longer lifespan (up to about 350 years) than its associated ant colonies (up to about 21 years). The size of the ant colonies and their reproductive success were strongly limited by the available nesting space provided by the host plants. Moreover, the resident ants positively affected the vegetative growth of their host plant, but had a negative effect on its reproduction by reducing the number of flowers and fruits by more than 50%. Altogether our results are important to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of ant-plant symbioses. The highly specialized interaction between long-lived plants and ants with a shorter lifespan produces an asymmetry in the evolutionary rates of the interaction which, in return, can affect the degree to which the interests of the two partners converge.",

    "abstract": "Sterilization of parasites prevents host reproduction, thereby diverting host resources to their own benefit. Previous theory predicts that parasites should evolve maximum virulence, yet hosts are often incompletely sterilized. Whereas prior attempts to resolve this paradox have sought evolutionary explanations, we present theory and experiments showing that incomplete sterilization can arise from ecologically driven fluctuations in parasite load. The African ant-plant Acacia drepanolobium reproduced more when occupied by small colonies of the sterilizing symbiont Crematogaster nigriceps. In nature, small colonies result from interference competition between ant colonies; these territorial conflicts thus provide intermittent windows of opportunity for host reproduction. Our mean-field model shows that numerical insufficiency of parasites can produce partial sterilization of host populations, creating the appearance of reduced virulence even if ants have evolved to sterilize completely. This general framework helps explain both the apparent ubiquity of partial sterilization parasitism and the ability of these symbiotic associations to persist.",

Recent phylogenetic studies have shown that the plants & the ants have been codiversifying over the past 16-20 million years.  The prevalence of coccoids in ant-plant mutualisms suggest that they play an important role in the evolution of ant-plant symbioses.  To determine whether the scale insects were involved in the evolutionary origin of the mutualism between Macaranga & Crematogaster, we constructed a cytochrome oxidase I gene phylogeny of the scale insects collected from myrmecophytic Macaranga & estimated their time of origin based on a cytochrome oxidase I molecular clock.  The minimum age of the associated Coccus was estimated to be half that of the ants, at 7-9million years, suggesting that they were latecomers in the evolutionary history of the symbiosis.  Crematogaster mitochondrial DNA lineages did not exhibit specificity towards Coccus mitochondrial DNA lineages, & the latter was not found to be specific towards Macaranga taxa.  This suggests that patterns of associations in the scale insects are dictated by opportunity rather than by specialized adaptations to host plant traits.]",

    "abstract": "Plant volatiles influence virtually all forms of ant-plant symbioses. However, little is known about their role in the mutualistic relationship between the African weaver ant and the cashew tree. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that cashew tree volatiles from plant parts most vulnerable to herbivory viz. inflorescence, leaves, and fruits, are attractive to weaver ants. Using behavioral assays, we show that these volatiles attract weaver ants but without significant difference in preference for any of the odors. These same plant parts are associated with extra floral nectaries (EFNs') and therefore we evaluated the possibility that the ants associate the volatiles with food rewards. We found that perception of the odors was followed by a searching response that led the ants to non-volatile sugar rewards. More importantly, we observed that weaver ants spent significantly more time around the odor when it was paired to a reward. Chemical analysis of volatiles showed that the plant parts shared similarities in chemical composition, dominated by monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Additionally, we evaluated the attractiveness of a synthetic blend of three ocimene isomers ((E)-beta-ocimene, (Z)-beta-ocimene and allo-ocimene) identified in cashew leaf odor and shown to constitute a candidate kairomone for the cashew pest Pseudotheraptus wayi. We found that the attractiveness of the blend was dose dependent, and the response of the ants was not significantly different to that established with the crude volatiles from plant tissues. These results present new and interesting possibilities for improving weaver ant performance in cashew pest management.
