The study on Bt cotton (expressing Cry1Ac protein) in Brazil found no significant impact on non-target herbivores, specifically the cotton aphid and the boll weevil, in terms of colonization rates, population abundance, and other ecological parameters. Both Bt and non-Bt cotton plots showed similar interactions with these herbivores and their predators, suggesting that Bt cotton does not adversely affect these non-target species under field conditions.

Research on Atta sexdens rubropilosa investigated the influence of different stimuli on trail marking and recruitment behavior, revealing that ants can alter their chemical communication in response to various environmental cues, indicating a sophisticated level of behavioral adaptation.

A study on the foraging activity of leaf-cutter ants showed that barometric pressure changes can significantly affect their behavior, with a decrease in pressure leading to increased foraging efficiency, suggesting that these ants are highly sensitive to environmental changes, which could have implications for understanding their ecological impact.

The toxicological effects of boric acid on Atta sexdens rubropilosa workers were examined, highlighting the importance of combining toxicological assays with morphological analyses to understand the impact of insecticides on ant physiology and health, particularly focusing on the midgut, Malpighian tubules, and postpharyngeal glands.

An investigation into social parasitism within Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants supported Emery's rule by showing that the early-grade social parasite Acromyrmex insinuator is likely the sister species of its host, although a derived social parasite from another genus did not follow this pattern, indicating multiple origins of social parasitism in the genus.

Research on the ecosystem functions of leaf-cutter ants reviewed their significant role in Neotropical ecosystems, including soil disturbance, nutrient cycling, and affecting vegetation through their herbivory and nest construction activities, pointing to their complex influence on ecosystem processes.

A systematic review on global drivers of ant elevational diversity revealed complex patterns that are not solely explained by traditional hypotheses like thermal energy or the mid-domain effect, suggesting that ant diversity patterns might be influenced by multiple, interacting factors.

These studies collectively enhance our understanding of ant ecology, including their interactions with plants and other species, their sensitivity to environmental changes, and their significant role in ecosystem processes, highlighting the complex nature of ant-related ecological dynamics.

The text provides a comprehensive overview of various studies on the morphology, physiology, and behavior of different ant species, particularly focusing on leaf-cutting ants and their metapleural glands, which are known for producing antibiotic compounds. The studies cover ant species from South America, especially Brazil, and delve into aspects such as population fluctuations, nest architecture, division of labor, and the functional morphology of glands like the metapleural and post-pharyngeal glands.

Key findings include:
- The metapleural glands of leaf-cutting ants are more developed in derived attine ants compared to non-fungus-growing ants and basal attines, indicating an evolutionary adaptation to protect their fungal gardens from pathogens.
- Lipid supplementation studies in Atta sexdens rubropilosa workers show that the post-pharyngeal gland plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, affecting the ants' lifespan and demonstrating the gland's specialization in lipid processing.
- Morphological studies reveal differences in the metapleural glands among various ant species, suggesting variations in secretion production levels and gland development across species, possibly reflecting their different ecological roles and behaviors.
